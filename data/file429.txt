4290084 i think were seeing pretty much any military engagement will have some sort of cyber components
4290085 any president who wants to emphasize military credentials ought to be concerned with protecting this critical infrastructure
4290086 there needs to be a critical look at the evidence and see where self regulation is working and where its not and where its not there is room for appropriate privacy regulations

4290088 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4290106 nixing antiquated prohibitions on oral sex and prostitution was the brainchild of rep phyllis kahn a minneapolis dfler whos a veteran of past similar attempts this time around kahn lumped in a lot of other stuff which didnt escape the notice of the minnesota family council whose members much likeoff beat seem to exhibit a certain zeal for internet porn
4290107 besides doing away with penalties for sodomy and certain types of prostitution they pointed out
4290108 whoever carnally knows a dead body or an animal or a bird is guilty of bestiality
4290109 kahn says that while she doesnt recall asking that the bill include the repeal of the bestiality necrophilia statute she wouldnt put it past herself
4290110 i very well may have said to repeal them just because they are also stupid laws to have on the books

4290117 how could you believe you had a chance to succeed
4290118 kahn says that while she doesnt recall asking that the bill include the repeal of the bestiality necrophilia statute she wouldnt put it past herself
4290119 i very well may have said to repeal them just because they are also stupid laws to have on the books
4290120 the way the bill was explained to me it was a bill to repeal some outdated laws on sodomy
4290121 i couldnt believe that anyone would even author that as it was written
4290122 i very well may have said to repeal them just because they are also stupid laws to have on the books however it was clearly a mistake as it gave the opponents a field day of extended rhetoric
4290123 i will go back to just going after the parts of the statutes that could seriously affect peoples lives and let the more general cleanup wait

4290135 it appears that the government has misread the nationalist mood of the people of jammu which is also supported by strong public opinion in the country this is the first time in history that the government has succeeded in even alienating nationalist opinion
4290136 the government should at least at this late hour recognise the gravity of the situation and speedily take a just and fair decision rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4290137 it is essentially nationalists versus the separatists the protest of the people of jammu has been nationalist they hold the national flag to their heart even when they protest they raise slogans in support of our motherland and also the indian army
4290138 the constitutional right to religion of the pilgrims has to be made effective the myopic attitude of the government and its snail like speed in finding a solution has allowed the situation to escalate
4290139 the people of jammu division have suffered from gross discrimination in matters relating to the governance of the state the delimitation is deferred there is discrimination in the matter of public employment disbursal of funds and development of the region
4290140 they are told on each occasion that the kashmir valley has a psyche and therefore the government is to submit to that psyche and if fairness is shown to the people of jammu the psyche of the valley will be hurt recent events have shown that the people in jammu are now determined to assert themselves in order to claim their fair share in the matter of both governance and development of the region

4290205 we have got the players to do well this season but the squad is a bit thin and the biggest problem is that we do not have much to make changes during the game
4290206 at 1 0 up against east fife i might have been tempted to take off the wide players and try and close the game out but we dont have a lot of options in midfield and we need to address that
4290207 it would be easy to do that but i want to see more of the trialists before i make a decision we are playing against irvine meadow on tuesday so ill have a better idea after that

4290216 i arrived here in kabul about two weeks ago immediately diving into the deep end of the swimming pool learning about the current situation of the program i am managing followed immediately by meetings with our national team
4290217 i was trying to think of how i could describe what i have seen and experienced so far and i wish that i could just send a bunch of photos but the security situation here makes photos a bit challenging
4290218 my first impressions are clouded by traffic road rules are often based on the creativity of the driver
4290219 it is difficult not to feel a wee bit vulnerable when an armed convoy cruises by
4290220 nearing our office we pass through a heavily guarded area serving as the headquarters for the international forces we generally try to pass through here quickly
4290221 although i had heard from friends how beautiful the afghan people are i was not prepared by the reality both men and woman are very striking and so very kind there are endless invitations for sitting down for a cup of tea around the office amazing
4290222 the program that i am managing works in five provinces one in the west and four in the east the inclusive education program is focusing on children with sensory disabilities and integrating them into community based schools
4290223 i am hoping to get out to all of the field locations in the coming weeks security permitting to support the inclusive education teams in each province
4290224 outside of work there is a very active international community there are a number of restaurants in town and thursday nights are pretty busy so i think that time here in kabul is going to pass very quickly
4290225 being here in afghanistan definitely speaks to the complexity of humanitarianism politics security civil war religious ideology and also speaks to community

4290228 i see this as a temporary challenge another hurdle at a time when government support for the arts is in decline know that the afi catalog and in fact building a more aggressive means for its completion remains a priority of the institute our goal is not to just finish 1974 it is to finish the catalog

4290233 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4290234 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films

4290242 its really nice to say ive done field work ive proven myself as a responsible adult
4290243 it looked really healthy everything was green and it was the beginning of august
4290244 and if youre lucky youll have native plants come in
4290245 you can study a plant in the classroom but out in the field it looks different all the time
4290246 the plan that were working on would help the d o e be able to continue its mission activities at the inl even if those species are listed

4290253 mr president its just you and me in the room here you dont need to make speeches to me im on your side remember were trying to deal here with your inner feelings of abandonment this time by the american populace and by many of your closest aides and how you can work through those feelings and perhaps those that might make you doubt your relevancy in your final months
4290254 were having a huge halloween party a new years eve party its full steam ahead
4290255 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4290256 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4290257 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4290258 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4290259 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4290260 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4290261 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4290262 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4290263 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4290264 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4290265 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4290266 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4290267 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4290268 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4290269 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4290270 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4290271 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4290272 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4290273 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4290274 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4290275 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4290276 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4290277 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4290278 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4290279 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4290280 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4290281 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4290282 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4290283 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4290284 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4290285 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4290286 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4290287 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4290288 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4290289 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4290296 pasalnya kunjungan ini dilakukan setelah indonesia mengambil posisi abstain dalam voting sidang dewan keamanan dk perserikatan bangsa bangsa pbb ketika memutuskan resolusi baru untuk ketiga kalinya berisi sanksi tambahan kepada iran berkenaan dengan program nuklir damai iran
4290297 dengan keberanian mengambil posisi abstain tersebut berarti pemerintahan presiden yudhoyono juga telah mengambil posisi politik yang paralel dengan aspirasi rakyat indonesia
4290298 iran harus menghargai dan menghormati indonesia dan karena itu harus mendengar nasehat nasehat indonesia berkenaan dengan isu nuklir tersebut
4290299 yakni mendukung program nuklir iran untuk tujuan damai bukan untuk tujuan pembuatan senjata perang dan indonesia meyakini rekomendasi yang merupakan kesimpulan badan atom internasional iaea yang dikeluarkan bulan februari 2008 yang lalu sebagai cukup sahih dan otoritatif
4290300 ini makna yang pertama dari kunjungan tersebut sedangkan yang kedua ialah kunjungan kenegaraan ini menjadi bermakna jika berhasil mempererat hubungan kerjasama yang konkret antara indonesia dan iran terutama di bidang ekonomi

4290439 its either gonna be called a twisted christmas or the twisted christmas a musical it tells a story but its very much a concert event but theres a storyline going on between the show is about 20 songs the band are the only actors there is a narrator i will tell you that much who fills in the spaces hes on video screen and he tells ala the rocky horror picture show to be honest he helps move the story along and tell the story if you saw hedwig and the angry inch off broadway a band performs and then in between there is interaction which further moves the story along so its pretty involved its a unique combination of things that have been done before and havent been done before and the goal really cause were not playing ourselves were playing a fictitious band in the musical eventually is to like the blue man group have a whole bunch of casts out there during the holiday season performing the show so thats the ultimate goal so its in development but its well on its way like i said i finished the script everybody loves it and now im sinking my teeth into writing the album which well start recording in january february for release in 2009

4290458 fiats belief is that to make a real impact on carbon dioxide emissions every model in the range has to be pulling its weight and making a real contribution
4290459 it is simply not good enough to have one model in the range that has good emissions and fuel economy covering for other poorly performing models this is why at fiat we have choice of the benchmark jtd multijet diesels and the remarkable compact fire and t jet petrol engines in all our cars so which ever fiat a customer chooses whether its petrol or diesel they will be driving a car that makes the best possible contribution to cutting carbon dioxide emissions

4290499 you would assume we all prefer instant gratification to the perceived pain of waiting to fork out in full for a summer holiday or new tv
4290500 it is a well known psychological trait that delayed gratification can generate a deeper sense of happiness we might call it saver satisfaction or the joy of thrift than buying on whim
4290501 items people are more likely to save up for which would have previously been purchased with borrowed money include holidays a new tv or a car
4290502 however we have found that clothes shoes and electronic goods like computer games are still bought as spontaneous purchases with borrowed money

4290513 households who are concerned about their jobs their homes and their ongoing ability to pay their bills will be left with no choice but to cut back on both heating and eating this winter
4290514 soaring wholesale gas prices have made their impact on suppliers profits and ultimately on consumer bills the government needs to provide a strategy and regulatory environment to ensure that the lights stay on at an affordable price
4290515 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4290516 this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfil their duties under the gender equality duty alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice
4290517 most of us agree that there are areas in cities where perhaps adult entertainment is suitable but there are areas where it certainly is not
4290518 in durham a club was granted a license by the city council in a completely inappropriate location and this has happened all over the country i think local councils need to be given more powers to turn these applications down where they are really not wanted

4290528 local and regional volleyball news stories from around the world
4290529 we have no choice but to change our strategy the alternatives we have are either to use two receivers or one receiver and two opposites we will decide which one to use match after match
4290530 our team is used to changing strategy and switching players as that is what we have done throughout the grand prix this year
4290531 they are in a good mood we have been waiting for the start of the games for a long time not only the match against russia but the start of the olympics in general
4290532 unfortunately it agueros departure has happened now we have to react and to think about what to do to make up for it coming to the olympics after many international successes has already been an amazing result for us
4290533 im glad to be here today our purpose is to see what international competition is like we can learn from this experience for future training we hope we can get good development in the future
4290534 of course it will be very difficult as we dont have any experience but we have our target set on winning a medal we hope to do our very best
4290535 although we didnt get a good result at the most recent grand prix weve recovered weve summarised our problems and recovered our physical strength however kun feng and ruirui zhao havent yet reached their best level after recent injuries
4290536 as there are very strong teams its a good opportunity to gain some experience and i wish all the teams good health
4290537 were very excited for the first match we hope for a great performance for the fans of the world and also we would like to have a great result
4290538 we have had a different preparation compared to athens i started coaching brazil in 2003 so the team that went to athens had been prepared mostly by brazils former coach
4290539 with this group i started a new cycle of work and during these last four years we have played about 140 matches at official and unofficial tournaments after which we have defined this squad
4290540 i think there is balance among the girls we have a strong group and this is positive on one side because you can keep the rhythm beating strong teams from the beginning of the games on the other hand qualifying for the quarterfinals is what counts but to win at the quarterfinals is the most important thing
4290541 we aim for a medal for reaching the podium having performed well at the grand prix doesnt say too much about our level though because many teams were not at full strength italy played without simona gioli and then also without antonella del core cuba played without nancy carrillo and rosir calderon usa were also not competing with the whole team
4290542 i think this team is more versatile than the one that played in athens these girls can play in different roles they are technically more complete this is what we have been focusing on
4290543 she and fernanda have the same level they are both high level players it doesnt change too much for our game
4290544 it is an honour to be here we are a new team so we take it as a good chance to learn from this experience
4290545 im glad to be here i feel satisfied to have qualified for the olympic games our dream is to win a medal but our first goal is to reach the quarterfinals after that we will talk about a medal we hope to do our best
4290546 we are cherishing this opportunity weve made all possible preparations and the team is ready to achieve its best result
4290547 you cannot predict the final a lot of teams here represent very tough competition our aim is to get the gold medal
4290548 were very happy to be here we think that the mens field is very strong and our pool is very challenging we hope that our team can play its best volleyball of the summer over these next two weeks
4290549 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court

4290577 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in although most of the earth is covered in water 44 percent of the worlds population live in areas with high water stress and the number is likely to increase because of factors such as as water sources deteriorate worldwide the testing of algae could be used to monitor water quality faster more cheaply and more accurately than techniques now in use dubinsky said the secret he said is to measure the rate of photosynthesis in the algae meaning the plants ability to transform light into energy during photosynthesis plants also release oxygen into the air dubinskys technique is easy to perform because of the over abundance of algae in the planets water most of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from algae a prototype tester that occupies about one square meter of a laboratory desktop shoots a laser beam at water samples to stimulate photosynthesis in the algae but not all of the lasers heat is used depending on the condition of the algae and the rate of photosynthesis some of the heat is shot back into the water creating sound waves dubinsky said with a special underwater microphone researchers are able to analyze the strength of the sound waves and determine the health of the algae and the condition of the surrounding water lead poisoning like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins

4290656 this album encompasses the struggle i have gone through over the past three years to make it as a successful recording artist
4290657 from the countless nights i sat there submissive on the casting couch just to sign that deal to working as a sherpa in the himalayas just to scrape together some money to book studio time every song means so much
4290658 you dont know me i came from the struggle i been hustlin the streets of canowindra since 95 fool im the realist of the lot and if yall fools wanna step come and take yo shot for real
4290659 oh yeah the two girls in the coffee shop wearing scrubs so you thought one of them was the gal paul is living with what led you to that i mean have you met her
4290660 no i only saw her that one time in the coffee shop
4290661 and i dont know her probably wouldnt recognize her if i saw her again but her name is lissa short for melissa i suppose
4290662 i was hoping you wouldnt ask me that one afternoon mrs sally and i had been having some wine with our dessert
4290663 did you ask her if paul still likes golf better than sex im sorry that was uncalled for
4290664 no thats okay she didnt say anything really she didnt have time to i was hoping paul would answer and id planned to talk to him like nothing had changed just to make him squirm in case she was in the same room but then she answers and she doesnt say hello like a normal person instead she answers lissa i just hung up then i took the phone off the hook for a couple of hours in case she tried to star 89 me or whatever it is you dial to call someone back after they call you you know what i mean
4290665 so back to the coffee shop one of these gals was lissa
4290666 yes the brunette with her hair bunched like a rats nest on top of her head she was talking about paul they were sitting at a table not far from the counter in their pee jays
4290667 ive never figured out why people insist on wearing their scrubs in public it always looks like theyve just come from a slumber party especially when theyre wearing those baby blue ones with the little yellow duckies all over them it looks ridiculous anyway i was working not paying attention but i kept hearing this woman saying paul this and paul that it took me a minute to make the connection scrubs plus paul and to realize it might be my paul she was talking about then the other one the blond says oh lissa thats just a guy thing brad goes through my underwear drawer all the time thats why i never hide anything important with my panties when i heard the name lissa thats when i knew she was her
4290668 did you hear what she was hiding in the underwear drawer
4290669 no darn it i missed that part then they started whispering so i went in the back for a couple of minutes but the suspense was killing me i decided it was time to wipe down the tables after the heavy lunch crowd maria made quotation marks in the air with her hands around the words lunch crowd and by then they were talking normal again i made sure i kept my back to them as i wiped down every table around them a couple of tables i did twice
4290670 the usual complaining mostly paul never takes me out he apparently thinks im fat because he wants me to join the gym paul hates it when i buy new shoes i have to pay for everything that has to do with the home paul has all kinds of money but would never think of flying to cancun for a real vacation blah blah blah all that sort of stuff
4290671 but then she says and get this paul told me that he would have taken his last girlfriend to cancun but she wouldnt go because she said the only thing the guys want to do in cancun is hangout at the nudie beaches all day and gawk at the girls or go out on the fishing boats with their buddies while the women either lie by the pool all day drinking tequila or shop i was so mad at him i didnt speak to him for three days but hey i would be perfectly happy lying by the pool all day sipping margaritas and shopping but hes never even asked me the insensitive prick thats what she called him
4290672 he never asked me either hes way too cheap for cancun
4290673 beats me but youd better believe i wanted to set them both straight right then and there
4290674 i know i know why would i want to marry a jerk like paul
4290675 thats not what i was going to ask but since you brought it up why would you
4290676 careful with his money and can be insensitive at times but with paul i know what to expect no surprises hes dependable
4290677 but you didnt expect him to kick you out did you
4290678 he didnt actually kick me out per se we had an understanding
4290679 but then she came along it was only supposed to be temporary he just needed space is all
4290680 so what was the question you were going to ask me
4290681 oh right i was going to ask besides a husband and kids what else is important to you i mean what else do you want
4290682 well no thats not all i want but thats the big stuff except maybe a house or nice apartment and some furniture eventually
4290683 you know one thing at a time theres a natural progression to it life is too chaotic otherwise dont you think
4290684 i believe that the more chaotic a persons internal world becomes the more that person tries to control his or her external world including the people in his life
4290685 im sorry i didnt mean to make you feel bad
4290686 youve been whining about the same thing for 14 years get off your duff and do something about it
4290687 its a different strain of marijuana a nonintoxicating strain with no thc that has 5 000 applicable uses including textiles and fiberboards
4290688 hempseed is more nutritious than soybeans hemp plastics stronger than other plastics and because its a weed its one of the most fibrous plants on the earth and it fights soil erosion

4290690 some people think hempfest is about as green an event as it can get but we can go greener
4290691 we are looking at ways to reduce our carbon footprints we are composting both at the cafe and staff kitchen using biodegradable food utensils corn plastics that dissolve a company called general biodiesel is harvesting the used cooking oil from vendors were running the main stage and hemposium stage on biodiesel and printing programs on 100 percent consumer recycled paper with soy inks
4290692 a premier northwest summer attraction adding to seattles notoriety as a marijuana friendly city
4290693 but the fact the city respects the first amendment our right to gather and free speech and supports hempfest shows its friendly
4290694 damn what a foul mouth you need to get that cleaned
4290695 whoa boy trying to get up all in my business

4290710 o sea que seg n ustedes el sentido de la vida es subsistir mantenerse vivo
4290711 no le des mas vueltas al asunto todos los gusanos nos dedicamos a buscar comida y a comer y ah se termina la historia eso es lo que nos marca nuestro instinto
4290712 por supuesto quien no lo sabe el sentido de la vida es buscar el amor y amar
4290713 y porque crees que ese es el nico sentido de la vida
4290714 porque si no encuentras el amor y no amas te sientes morir y si te sientes morir es como morir en vida y si te mueres en vida no vives
4290715 es que para mi intentar encontrar el amor es como intentar encontrar el aire no hace falta ni buscarlo ni encontrarlo esta en todos lados en el aire que respiramos en el sol que nos da calor en la tierra que nos da alimento en el agua que sacia nuestra sed en la flor que nos comparte su belleza y en la planta que comparte su sombra
4290716 por supuesto quien no lo sabe el sentido de la vida es llegar a la cima elevarse hasta lo mas alto
4290717 ese si que era un graaaaaaaaaaaaaaan sentido para su vida un sentido lo suficientemente grandioso que merec a ser vivido
4290718 ana el sentido de la vida es llegar a la cima elevarse hasta lo mas alto es por ac ven conmigo

4290777 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4290778 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4290779 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4290780 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4290781 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4290782 sales are now slower than they were on launch day but not too much the sales didnt just die after the first few days as they do with some games
4290783 as a result it looks like i will be able to make the next game without needing to get a job that would interfere with that the estimated sales so far of 55 000 are not enough for this but extrapolating into the future the situation looks safe thank you once again for making that possible

4290799 wexford have done very well in the cup competitions this year and are playing another one of my former clubs cork city in the semi final of the league cup this month as well
4290800 i know what mick is trying to do with the club and its going to be tough with a squad made up of just wexford players but if any man can bring success to wexford soccer its mick wallace what hes done for the county is brilliant
4290801 i always keep an eye out for wexfords results and im in regular contact with pat dolan and mick wallace as well as conor sinnott who i know from back home and was with reading for a while a couple of years ago
4290802 pats will be massive favourites but its the biggest game the wexford lads will have played and im sure it will be closer than people think especially on front of a big home crowd in ferrycarrig
4290803 i was at the fai ford cup final last year working for rte and despite the weather it was a good game and a great event its still the biggest day in irish domestic soccer so every team wants to win it

4290808 were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4290809 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4290810 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4290811 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4290812 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4290813 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4290814 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4290815 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4290816 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get eczema dermatitis rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing
4290817 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
4290818 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
4290819 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
4290820 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it
4290821 if a nation of people agrees to settle their political disputes through free elections and ballots and then some who cannot win that way decided to resort instead to bullets in order to achieve the results they desire may a president use bullets to vindicate free elections and ballots
4290822 as aristotle explained long ago natural right is everywhere and always changeable though no moral relativist aristotle understood that what is right depends upon the particulars of a situation therefore right changes as situations change stated differently the question of natural right is always the question of the right thing to do according to nature here and now

4290827 weve noticed as weve driven by that theres been a lot of graffiti on the skateboarding section and theres a lot of kids hanging out but who knows if theyre responsible or not
4290828 when you drive by and see all of that graffiti and the skateboarders you question whether or not its a place to come
4290829 i think its just summertime more active more people kids out of school
4290830 it has put a lot of pressure on me and its not always been easy

4290832 look forward to a great fortune and a new lease on life
4290833 whatever else jesus came to do one thing is clear he came to set you free god is not a warden he is a deliverer and so earnest is he about your freedom that he was willing to be taken captive and crucified on your behalf just so you can run free

4290835 we have a team of players who have that same immense desire and ron will fit right in

4290838 how to take skills learned from mom to kick butt at work
4290839 the university of california berkeley haas school of business study of nearly 1 000 harvard undergraduates found that 15 years after graduation business school graduates were more likely than doctors or lawyers to leave the workforce

4291056 our focus on environmental restoration and infrastructure construction has provided a foundation to provide increased value to our client and its recycling programs in tennessee
4291057 these projects are integral to our growth strategy as they help us establish a foothold in the infrastructure construction business
4291058 we trust that because it involves public money and must be accounted for in councils budget our request will not be too difficult to grant
4291059 does this mean they didnt calculate it properly when they told the public in june
4291060 or did it mean they were trying to hide something
4291061 that given the potential no matter how small for contamination of the bega and shires water supply and the potential for litter containment issues at the proposed wolumla tip site council as a fall back position investigate with the relevant state bodies to identify any potential site that may be held in government ownership that was not previously investigated and which could be used as an alternate location if it is deemed by council that any potential risks are too great at the currently proposed wanatta lane site
4291062 andrew constance has been lining up swings at me on a number of occasions and i would like to take this opportunity to kick the ball firmly back into mr constances court
4291063 i feel we are getting to a point where we are backing ourselves into a corner and we will not have a site to fall back on if the need arises
4291064 we need to go back to the drawing board and should be looking at an alternative site anyway
4291065 the new council will be forced to make a decision without the five years of experience with the issue we have been privy to
4291066 mr constance is not an expert and he should not be required to become part of the council process it is not appropriate and the matter should be deferred
4291067 mr constance over a period of time has been very critical of this council he has instigated public meetings and criticised council at these meetings
4291068 we have stayed out of this public debate and have been damaged because of it
4291069 he has had five and a half years as state member so giving him another month to come up with an alternative would not be too soon
4291070 constance is almost publically demanding that we sell the land and take up the offer made however an agent has told us the land would be valued at 800 000 on the open market
4291071 constance is asking us to sell it at under its market value
4291072 the processes we have followed have been appropriate but mr constance jumps on councils back time and time again
4291073 enough is enough mr constance it is time for a nappy change
4291074 council will take up the offer of member for bega andrew constance for him to identify potential other sites held in government ownership mr constance is asked to identify these sites within one month and to check against those that have already been investigated for council to assess potential
4291075 i think it is a good idea to put the ball back in his court if anyone criticises council at any level of government then we are entitled to a reply
4291076 we have allowed this debate to be high jacked somewhat
4291077 mr constance if you think we are not doing it properly come and join us and help us do it better
4291078 for years i have argued that there is no room for politics in this chamber but mr constance in his state position should be trying to work together with council not against us
4291079 i commend this motion because it takes the politics out of the equation in the lead up to the elections
4291080 if almighty con stance can find another solution than why not have another look
4291081 rather than find a solution to the problem all it seemed to be was an anti andrew constance attack
4291082 there was no real outcome and they just picked on andrew constance and his efforts
4291083 councils had six and a half years to look at this and now all they are doing is getting stuck into someone who has suggested looking for an alternative
4291084 couldnt believe the aggressive nature of the attack on andrew constance
4291085 the attitude appeared to be that he shouldnt interfere in council business
4291086 that was completely off base all he was doing was trying to help the people
4291087 it got right away from the real issue and concentrated on vilifying mr constance
4291088 all he was trying to do was offer another direction away from a potential disaster
4291089 we havent the slightest idea when this can be brought under control
4291090 killing rioting and looting are contrary to the best traditions of this country

4291097 this is the day we have been waiting for since pearl harbor this is the day when fascism finally dies as we always knew it would
4291098 without whose prodigious efforts the war in the east would still have many years to run
4291099 our hearts are full to overflowing as are your own yet there is not one of us who has experienced this terrible war who does not realise that we shall feel its inevitable consequences long after we have all forgotten our rejoicings today
4291100 were definitely seeing the impact of the national housing slowdown in the metro area but the city of atlanta is still booming
4291101 in fact for the first time in at least four decades the city of atlanta added more new residents than gwinnett county
4291102 this is the first significant slowdown in metro atlantas growth since the recession earlier this decade
4291103 we rebounded then and we certainly expect to rebound this time
4291104 the second quarter was a transitional quarter for the company as we completed a thorough review of our strategic priorities with a focus on delivering future profitable growth
4291105 following this review we completed the sale of palermo italian foods to a group of investors led by palermos president and classified the pasani and eco pak and grupo sur businesses as discontinued operations which we estimate will result in the return of approximately 2 4 million based on termination agreements over the next six months while our second quarter results were impacted by several one time items associated with the restart of our business through the actions taken over the past several months we are creating a more streamlined organization focused on building value in our core businesses which we believe will improve the companys overall financial position over the long term by refocusing our efforts on our initial goal of identifying and securing brands purchasing food products globally and distributing these products in mexico we believe we can continue to build upon our position as the leading distributor of imported products in mexico
4291106 during the second quarter we entered into two new distribution agreements including fusion energy drink and rockstar energy drink the addition of these well recognizable and desirable brands to our portfolio reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering a comprehensive portfolio of high quality food and beverage products to the mexican marketplace with the addition of these brands to our portfolio we will look to replicate our success in expanding the market share of other leading brands within our portfolio such as miller beer cora and ferrarelle while we will continue to focus our efforts on securing exclusive rights to well recognized desirable branded products we recognize that our growth is somewhat limited by our current cash and working capital constraints as such we remain intently focused on obtaining a working capital credit facility to fund our ongoing operations and support the continued expansion of our business
4291107 we continue to believe that significant value exists in our current operations through the execution of our long term business opportunities looking forward we will continue to utilize our existing distribution network and technology infrastructure to leverage our operations and drive future organic and acquired growth

4291111 this is not just about me getting it in the neck
4291112 it is about the community and their concerns for the area where they live
4291113 no member of the community deserves that sort of treatment
4291114 the people involved with the action group have spent countless hours on this and people such as ian gordon walking out of the council in disgust is not on
4291115 i want to work with council and as a member of parliament i have to be thick skinned
4291116 councillors are public figures and will be scrutinised so if they cant handle it they shouldnt put their hand up
4291117 the decision of the council to issue an ultimatum that i have one month to find them an alternate site to wanatta lane tip is farcical
4291118 issuing such an ultimatum is nothing more than an ill conceived and shortsighted political stunt that might bring amusement to a handful of mischief making councillors but will bring no joy to a community fighting the proposed super tip at wolumla
4291119 it was only last friday that the council indicated that the wolumla land would not be sold
4291120 so what happened between friday and tuesday nights council meeting for them to now want to pursue state land
4291121 the fact is that other than cr buchanan and the mayor tony allen who was the only councillor who spoke at the recent public meeting the councillors re contesting the september local government elections dont have the backbone to express a view
4291122 if the councillors are serious that they want me to approach the state government then i want a written guarantee that they will agree to adequately assess other sites and they will immediately dispose of the wanatta lane land
4291123 i want to know if their intentions are honourable or do they just want to build it at wolumla anyway
4291124 however i will not tolerate games and wasting of peoples time

4291144 money has divided us as a country politics are there but they are just a distraction to it she wrote this week in her notebook she reads this as kadee shows me an impressive drawing of a cat she made for me
4291145 yet this is where we are as a country not believing the good in one another we need to come together to stop being divided
4291146 i have no credentials for others to listen to me just my own voice which wants to be heard i am a person too just like the millionaires
4291147 i felt like i let my family down i felt horrible as a mother as a wife that is in charge of the money
4291148 i knew my only chance to receive tickets would be to act fast
4291149 how is it fair that after i stay up night after night waiting for ticket information and after i followed each direction saddleback churchs web site led me to that i never stood a chance to get the tickets
4291150 when you have the national stage shouldnt you be open to everybody a church that espouses its openness is now catering to the haves and have nots
4291151 but i dont see the church suffering any long term image damage
4291152 the national platform of the presidential candidates and the subsequent national coverage of the event put the church into the stratosphere
4291153 its like the event is closed and being held in a mansion in beverly hills
4291154 the church has done a lot of good things for the community but this is going to leave a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths
4291155 ill take the kids and go do something and you can sew or take a bath or do whatever youd like just have some time to yourself to unwind

4291162 my mother made pie crusts with lard when i was a girl and i grew up with the firm belief that there was no better part of the pie than the crust pie experts know that lard makes the flakiest most flavorful crust known to man its due to the chemistry of lards lipids which form unusually large crystals
4291163 it just feels right to me it feels like a burger
4291164 in my case i was never very keen on the notion of the reclusive author working in solitude and have always tried to interact with my readers so ive spent a lot of time on my website knowing that it is one of the rare public platforms besides the traditional book signing open to me
4291165 redesigned its site adding customer ratings and free online book reviews
4291166 reading rockets which airs this fall it will focus on how to make the make the most of the years before a child starts school
4291167 weve got like nine tournaments left or something like that theres so much golf to be played i just want to play some solid golf and see what happens
4291168 everything was pretty good ive been striking the ball really well and now im starting to score with it
4291169 ive been feeling like its been coming for the last six or seven weeks like something good might happen
4291170 the main thing was getting off to a good start with birdies on the first three holes that set the pace and got me a good feeling out there
4291171 ive been hitting it pretty good but i feel like ive been leaving a few shots out there
4291172 id say i was just a lot more efficient today
4291173 ive learned that sometimes i need to take a more conservative approach
4291174 its playing smarter than you think you should sometimes i play too aggressive at times when you do that there are days you get away with it and there are days you dont when you dont you wind up making some big numbers i just havent gotten away with it this year
4291175 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4291176 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4291177 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4291178 you know obviously very good round you know it was one of those rounds i just kind of when i had to hole 8 6 10 footers for par i did
4291179 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedexcup it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 15 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150 for a player of my current stature those are the real concerns
4291180 thats no secret ive told everybody i dont want to make it a major thought provoking thing because i want to take care of my business on the golf course and let things fall where they fall
4291181 but once you experience one of those things wear that flag on your shirt you want to be associated every year
4291182 i thought about it too much i made it too much of a goal a right out in front of me goal my game hasnt come together like i wanted it to this year but its nothing significant i know that it will turn around
4291183 what im saying is if i dont make it that big a deal where it works on my mind i think good things can happen much like the presidents cup last year i wanted to be on that team very bad and i just played and it happened thats kind of the way i have to go about it i have got three weeks to prove myself and thats going to be my goal
4291184 i was walking up to that green i kind of had to pinch my arm a little bit and make sure i was still awake
4291185 i played well it was pretty nerve wracking there the first few holes i managed to calm myself down the last hole i kind of hit a bad tee shot wish i could have that back overall i played great
4291186 i saw his win from wire to wire every step with him because at night he would come back and talk about it
4291187 he said to me sunday night if i can do it you can do it

4291189 the guys the clothing company he wears theyre from toronto so they picked it up
4291190 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4291191 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4291192 although im not sure anything will make some of them feel better

4291195 theyve been quite clever about being modern and being high tech
4291196 over the top lives up to its name wooing audiences with a shorter running time a nod
4291197 the presentation of the show has definitely evolved says ringmaster chuck wagner
4291198 this is a grand american tradition and we are proud of that we stay true to those traditions but the packaging of the show brings us into the 21st century as the culture has changed the circus has evolved
4291199 when those acts are on they have everybodys full attention theres no room for error i dont mean to be negative but its very dangerous ive seen it 300 times and every time it gets my full attention
4291200 there are a lot of folks out there who have their hearts in the right place who have a misunderstanding wagner says
4291201 you can get very close to the elephants says trainer aaron morris a third generation elephant expert
4291202 theres just a small velvet rope between you and these amazing animals

4291234 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
4291235 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
4291236 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
4291237 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
4291238 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

4291273 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4291274 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4291288 the authority collects far more revenue from subway bus and commuter rail fares dedicated taxes and bridge and tunnel tolls than it draws from direct government aid
4291289 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4291290 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4291291 so how will mrs clinton who is a super delegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit to see if it unfolds as the obama campaign hopes free of acrimony tune in on wednesday aug 27
4291292 i cant care less about this delegate count we have more voters going for clinton however dnc discounts it
4291293 i cant believe it that obama has the thick thick to accuse mccain of flip flopping when he himself flip flops more times than my fingers can count in one hand

4291307 some pretty clear statements about chance and gods providence in scripture
4291308 the lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the lord
4291309 the problem is that some want to impose on god a darwinian process which is by definition a non control process and then try to make it fit in with a picture of god under control
4291310 god can use random events the problem is however tes insist that god does everything that way
4291311 i think design is the question and you think its the answer
4291312 do not believe there is any naturalistic mechanism that can explain macro evolution or the origin of life
4291313 darwinian evolution is out of gods control because darwin dawkins said it was
4291314 i can sum it all up in three words evolution is a lie
4291315 all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not really
4291316 people who have to deal with black employees find this not true
4291317 there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level
4291318 there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so

4291353 it looks like its levelling off karapiro has maintained a steady outflow overnight and were seeing that levelling off as well
4291354 any more rain will go straight into the rivers and the rivers will react quite quickly
4291355 weve activated our flood room for monitoring as a result the waipas up again but we dont expect it to get to last weeks level but every little bit will hold the river up
4291356 theres not too much pressure on karapiro at the moment were looking at maintaining and creating that storage in the river system in light of the rainfall ahead of us
4291357 further heavy rain wouldnt be welcome were trying to manage the flows as best we can through the upper middle and lower catchment

4291359 the justice department is committed to ensuring that recipients of federal health care funds adhere to the law so that appropriate health care services are provided to all eligible patients
4291360 a settlement of this magnitude sends the clear message that this office takes health care fraud very seriously
4291361 this case also illustrates the perils a defendant faces in taking a case such as this to trial
4291362 this settlement should send a clear message that the state of illinois will not tolerate illegal conduct in the provision of healthcare for illinoisans

4291366 should airlines have a section of the plane reserved for parents with babies and smaller children
4291367 even a kids only section would not prevent truly unruly kids and their parents from being booted off a flight as happened on a recent southwest airlines flight to phoenix when a mother traveling with her four children was unable to keep them in their seats
4291368 just grin and bear it or start wailing kicking and screaming yourself
4291369 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4291370 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4291371 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4291372 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy
4291373 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4291374 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4291375 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4291376 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4291377 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier
4291378 i mean we love our america but the thing is we want to keep it a country that were proud of and that we can live in and thats safe for everybody and you know one of the reasons im doing this walk is i realized i felt a lot of fear concerning the government and i dont want to feel that way
4291379 at the time ibms outlook came out it looked like a bit of a stretch
4291380 but since then theyve produced strong results now theres a fair shot they might exceed their goal
4291381 our thinking is that our job is to make money for investors and return it to them
4291382 today we get 60 of our revenue growth from the established markets
4291383 but five years out we expect 60 of our growth to come from
4291384 a lot of the low hanging fruit has already been bought
4291385 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4291386 i am so pissed right now you have no idea 2008 is officially the worst year ever
4291387 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4291388 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4291389 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4291390 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4291391 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4291392 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4291393 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4291394 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4291395 again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4291396 we hope to restart the pipelines as soon as the situation becomes safe
4291397 it is astounding that after admitting to each and every charge and allegation the defendant now denies culpability
4291398 i never told anyone i was inheriting any money there is nobody to support
4291399 we all really wanted him to be real hes a liar thats the thing he tells such big stories most liars dont go that big thats what hes good at

4291401 i was looking for the building and mosher was sitting back letting it all go
4291402 two years ago for a case that had no merit
4291403 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4291404 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4291405 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4291406 the constable was operational that day he actually started shift at 8am that day from crookwell
4291407 there were police out they were patrolling the roads and making assessments in accordance with the contingency plans thatve been in place for over 10 years
4291408 the future looks positive for our club and we are really well placed to revitalise our facilities and get back on track
4291409 its the first time the event has attracted such a large attendance including operators from within the region and also international operators like sprint nextel
4291410 clearly wimax is high on the agenda in the middle east
4291411 wimax will hopefully lead to a classic win win scenario
4291412 carrier service providers will benefit from an ip based architecture and technology that drives a cost performance advantage not provided by 3g networks
4291413 there are new revenue streams and models and theres a time to market advantage we anticipate the economies of scale from deployments will help lower costs and boost mass market adoption customers will benefit too as they gain access to new types of devices with expanded capabilities and applications
4291414 user demand for mobile broadcast services is rapidly expanding and we believe that the exciting new applications offered through this alliance will provide mobile operators a unique ability to deliver the key differentiating feature of 4g networks

4291416 why do they make these bloody offers and then not follow up on them
4291417 the 75 day clause is so we can make sure weve got the information it gives us time to contact people when there are problems
4291418 this could be regarded as almost bait misleading advertising by the retailers at times they are happy to sell the products knowing it is going to be a while before the offer is honoured but not warning the customer that there may be a delay of several months
4291419 many stores have security cameras but if an individual observed someone putting household rubbish in one of the bins wed like them to at least record the vehicles licence plate we could then track the owner
4291420 you could even argue that if a person put out the wrong type of bag on the side of the road for collection they would be in breach of the bylaw
4291421 essentially you are not allowed to dispose of offensive household or trade waste in the bins
4291422 ordinary boys are neither especially good or especially bad boys
4291423 im trying to identify what resources the school could plan because of gender specific demands boys bring to learning
4291424 it is about getting every boy to achieve his maximum potential
4291425 boys like structure they like to know the mileposts they like to feel active in their learning
4291426 if there were two things i would make compulsory in teacher training it would be understanding gender and the physiology of the human brain and how it engages learning

4291445 a suspect is willing to go after an armed police officer and shoot them what would they do to a normal citizen
4291446 the worst part of the job over the years has been the smoke
4291447 ive woken up feeling hung over in the morning and not had a drop to drink it was bad
4291448 but i always kept my foot in the restaurant door while doing other jobs
4291449 i never really wanted my own bar until about two years ago
4291450 so i know 90 percent of the people who come through the door

4291454 it is a tough job market out there right now
4291455 i am already getting phone calls from area employers interested in joining us and i have been on the phone and sending e mails to area employees asking if they want to participate
4291456 our goal is to provide every service we can job loss affects individuals and families
4291457 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4291458 again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4291459 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
4291460 instant connection to information without needing to search by keyword or type in a lengthy url
4291461 writing little notes or usually drawings since kids arent yet reading in kindergarten drawing a little picture or putting a little sticker in a lunch box or hearts so a special message for a child that lunch time as away of reminder of the parents still there and thinking about them
4291462 the biggest adjustment of all is the new social and emotional component so before the primary focus is on academics and although that still remains the case in middle school theyre also becoming more aware of friends around them wanting to make social connections wanting to fit in
4291463 talk through what to expect so rather than going to the school setting with the middle schooler you may practice with a locker so in other words practice opening a combination
4291464 they have increased academic pressure together with the increased social emotional component in other words coping with cliques trying to manage all their social commitments together within adolescence having more varied emotions
4291465 take a preventative approach helping parents have some skills that may help to prevent more serious issues from arising in the high school setting

4291471 in addition he has extensive playoff experience and has been part of an nba championship team he knows what it takes to be a part of a winning team and we welcome a player with his level of experience
4291472 we have found an exciting and innovative way of retaining his considerable expertise until we have recruited someone who can replace him
4291473 too often older people come far down the pecking order yet again ageism rears its ugly head
4291474 the new characters are more in tune with modern society and with the added touch of a first name more human

4291506 we have the most fit city behind us were not only going to dominate the race but im also willing to bet that new yorks going to be rocking harder than any other city on the planet
4291507 this race is bringing together hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world to run and listen to some great music while serving a higher cause and im excited to perform in l a as part of the grand finale
4291508 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4291509 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4291510 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4291511 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation
4291512 tonight the city is full of morgues and all the toilets are overflowing
4291513 with the laws of a brothel and the fireproof bones of a preacher with your lingo coined from the sacrament of a casino on a government loan with a guillotine in your libido

4291515 we can live in a hollow tree grow a boat and bury the sea
4291516 i imagine bikes strollers wheelchairs skateboards and maybe just people sitting along the route meeting their neighbors and chatting with them
4291517 everyone said this made so much sense to have people be out and active and happy
4291518 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4291519 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4291520 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4291521 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4291522 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4291524 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4291525 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4291526 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4291527 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4291528 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4291529 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4291530 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4291531 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4291532 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4291533 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4291534 its strange when 7 out of 10 patients with impotency and premature ejaculation issues attribute their problem to the masturbation habits this is such a prevalent myth
4291535 most men associate their value with their organ size and also with their macho personality thus they erroneously believe that the dimensions of their penis are of great importance for sexual techniques and gratification
4291536 wrong notions paralyse the sexual response between partners with so many baseless perceptions in ones mind a level of curiosity creeps in and one cant be anxious and sensuous at the same time
4291537 when you operate under false assumptions you are not able to give your mate what he truly wants and needs people who rely too much on popular perceptions of sex miss out on that extra dimension
4291538 to serve as a comprehensive unbiased resource where people can accurately compare and evaluate the thousands of service offerings

4291543 universal search is a nuisance and distraction i was already getting too many result options now they are dumping too much data in front of me
4291544 over one third of online search users who perform a search as a result of exposure to some offline channel recall making a purchase via any channel as a result of that search
4291545 the us has a much higher proportion of in house search marketers who tend to be less innovative and do not operate search as effectively as search agencies slowing the flow of funds from other media
4291546 the data we have is pushing the state of the art
4291547 we see all the links going to a page how the content is changing on the page over time

4291557 its also possible that web servers with sybase database backends could also conceivably be exploited
4291558 similar to phishing this attack takes advantage of the website visitors trust in the site they are visiting instead of phishing for information however malware is sent to the client which the client has a higher likelihood of accepting being from a trusted site
4291559 as of today this attack is still working and ongoing we are seeing evidence of successful exploitation attempts across hundreds of web pages these web pages are associated with web sites from around the world and supplying various content including government sites sales sites real estate sites and financial information sites among others

4291569 perhaps the most pernicious assumption over the past week however is that russia wanted to effect

4291595 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4291596 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track
4291597 we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure

4291607 you have shown great kindness to your servant my father david because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart
4291608 now o lord my god you have made your servant king in place of my father david but i am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties your servant is here among the people you have chosen a great people too numerous to count or number v 9 so give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong for who is able to govern this great people of yours
4291609 since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice i will do what you have asked i will give you a wise and discerning heart so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be v 13 moreover i will give you what you have not asked for both riches and honor so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings and if you walk in my ways and obey my statues and commands as david your father did i will give you a long life

4291612 no the living one is my son the dead one is yours

4291630 again hard not to be caught up in her enthusiasm too she really believed in what she was doing and she believed in making a difference

4291761 ik ben het licht der wereld wie mij volgt zal nimmer in de duisternis wandelen maar hij zal het licht des levens hebben
4291762 in het woord was leven en het leven was het licht der mensen en het licht schijnt in de duisternis en de duisternis heeft het niet gegrepen
4291763 gij zijt het licht der wereld laat zo uw licht schijnen voor de mensen opdat zij uw goede werken zien en uw vader die in de hemel is verheerlijken
4291764 alzo werden voltooid de hemel en de aarde toen god op de zevende dag het werk voltooid had dat hij gemaakt had rustte hij op de zevende dag van al het werk dat hij gemaakt had en god zegende de zevende dag en heiligde die omdat hij daarop gerust heeft van al het werk dat god scheppende tot stand had gebracht

4291783 and similarly miserable condition of death when one is lying in coma so many sufferings is going on so many dreaming the yamaduta is coming sometimes the man on the deathbed cries hes so much suffering but there is no remedy everyone is helpless so that is the miserable condition of death
4291784 there is reincarnation you will be okay just pray god is kind
4291785 he is in hospital now and we need you here
4291786 i beg you let me loose please let me loose
4291787 i tried to get away i really did but they got me
4291788 just let me rest just ten minutes please i beg you
4291789 i know i woke you up because i saw three of them floating above his bed and he was covering and looking up
4291790 hes just fighting it and it happens to everyone theres even a term for it its called terminal restlessness and they give nurses seminars about how to deal with it
4291791 to see the yamadutas or the carriers of order of yamaraja superintendent of death to see face to face
4291792 but you take this mission and go everywhere in every corner i am thankful to you you are already doing that in europe and america people are deep asleep because people are sleeping under misguidance and they are becoming candidate for being carried away by the yamaduta this is the position of the whole world yamaduta yamaduta will not excuse you however you may be very proud of becoming independent this is not possible to save the human civilization the rascal civilization that there is no life after death and you go on enjoying as much as you like this wrong civilization is a killing civilization so you save them you save them otherwise the yamaduta is there
4291793 this man was like this and he must be carried to yamaraja for punishment
4291794 at the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder at that time even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the lord may not be able to chant the hare krsna mantra very distinctly nevertheless such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name while the body is fit therefore why should we not chant the holy name of the lord loudly and distinctly if one does so it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be properly able to chant the holy name of the lord with love and faith
4291795 whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body that state he will attain without fail if one practices chanting the hare krsna mantra he is naturally expected to chant hare krsna when he meets with some accident even without such practice however if one somehow or other chants the holy name of the lord hare krsna when he meets with an accident and dies he will be saved from hellish life after death one is immediately absolved from having to enter hellish life even though he is sinful
4291796 the yamadutas had considered only the external situation of ajamila since he was extremely sinful throughout his life they thought he should be taken to yamaraja and did not know that he had become free from the reactions of all his sins the visnudutas therefore instructed that because he had chanted the four syllables of the name narayana at the time of his death he was freed from all sinful reactions
4291797 simply by chanting one holy name of hari a sinful man can counteract the reactions to more sins than he is able to commit
4291798 if one chants the holy name of the lord even in a helpless condition or without desiring to do so all the reactions of his sinful life depart just as when a lion roars all the small animals flee in fear
4291799 by once chanting the holy name of the lord which consists of the two syllables ha ri one guarantees his path to liberation

4291826 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4291827 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the

4291830 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4291831 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4291832 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4291834 six months into the marriage he shattered the top of a glass end table with his fist during one of his fits of rage something was very wrong
4291835 a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation often including the threat or use of violence battering happens when one person believes they are entitled to control another assault battering and domestic violence are crimes
4291836 if i had taken the car in to get a repair done or a tire fixed he would always quiz me about whether men flirted with me
4291837 he resented any time that i spent with my family and would often exaggerate their shortcomings in hopes of educating me on their faults after my marriage ended my parents confessed to me that they always felt like something just wasnt right because of the drastic changes they saw happening within me
4291838 he was a smart abuser he never hit me in the face or left a mark on me that anyone else would be able to observe one time he did tread a fine line when he wrenched my neck a bit too long and i had difficulty swallowing for a day yet nobody ever questioned me or expressed concern about his behavior he was a master of disguise
4291839 i was no different than any other girl who plays cinderella but as a wife when i awoke every morning and faced myself in the mirror i knew i had failed at the biggest decision of my life to go to somebody and admit this was something my pride would not enable me to do
4291840 battering escalates it often begins with behaviors like threats name calling violence in her presence such as putting a fist through a wall and or damage to objects or pets
4291841 during the last year of our marriage occasionally he would introduce a gun into our fights at first he didnt say he was going to shoot or kill me he said he was going to force me to kill him he would wrap my hand around the trigger underneath his vice like grip and then he would stand in front of the gun
4291842 he said that only my fingerprints would be on the gun and they would put me away for life of course he loved to hear me beg and plead and he would always relent
4291843 then during our last fight his tone changed and his rage lessened this time in a calculating way he said he was going to kill me and then he was going to drive over and kill my parents
4291844 i tried to sneak in a call to the police but he came into the room and began yanking all the phones out of the walls somehow i managed to flee into a nearby wheat field and hide
4291845 he got into his pickup and drove around like a madman shining his headlights in every direction i somehow managed to get the keys to our car and flee to safety
4291846 i drove twenty five miles that night to a friends house she knew nothing of our problems but she was a co worker who had become a close friend and i knew that my husband would never look there that couple made life disrupting changes to protect me they were also diligent about speaking truth

4291850 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4291851 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4291852 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4291891 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
4291892 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4291893 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
4291894 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
4291895 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century

4291903 survivior havent we gone about 15 seasons too long gabon
4291904 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4291905 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4291906 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4291907 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4291908 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4291909 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4291915 the video indicated that the vien duong appeared to collide or very nearly collide with a killer whale while continuing to manoeuvre around other members of the pod at full speed and in close proximity
4291916 i dont want to sound apologetic but you know it could happen to anybody however once you find yourself amongst killer whales the law clearly requires us to take evasive action where possible
4291917 they spend as much time watching the whale watchers as whale watchers are watching whales
4291918 they are highly intelligent creatures some people think maybe even more intelligent than human beings
4291919 you have people who do all sorts of strange things around not just whales but all wildlife
4291920 ive seen people try to get their kids up close to a rutting elk to get a nice picture people who will feed wildlife on the corner of a road people who drive through a pod of killer whales some people just dont have the understanding

4291925 at the end of all that process the dna remaining inside the bone samples themselves is in very poor shape and it makes it very difficult to retrieve any dna out of it
4291926 for instance if we have some found human remains and we develop a mitochondrial dna type from there we can now compare that type to suspected brothers or sisters of that individual we can also look at mothers and aunts or female cousins along that line
4291927 thats very useful because it can be very difficult to track down relatives and get dna to have some comparisons to do without the relatives we cant make any identifications at all
4291928 you could use mitochondrial dna on a brand new sample like a blood stain or a hair sample or you could use it on very very old degraded samples like skeletal remains teeth even shed hairs from very cold crime scenes

4291945 why do you want money if you already had some
4291946 daddy i have rs 500 now can i buy an hour of your time
4291947 it was painted as a real family event too and no one seems to have realised its wrong
4291948 they have lost the plot and it is an absolute disgrace the victim has already been through enough without having these clowns organising a fundraising day
4291949 unlike franchises business startups or sales of existing businesses mlm business with very little capital

4291955 after leaving the police academy i started going to several churches when i asked to be baptized they refused because they were worried i was a mole
4291956 up to the age of 40 i lived as a christian and was outcast by my family and the church was still suspicious of me i wasnt married then because christian families refused to allow me to marry their daughters because the marriage procedures would have been carried out under the islamic law through a maazoun because my identification papers say that im a muslim
4291957 if my daughter were able to travel with me i wouldnt have come back to egypt
4291958 state security investigation bureau called me and interrogated me for six hours
4291959 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat

4291962 we tease him and he goes im a little bit fatigued like we all are but i say yeah but youre old
4291963 its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what were sticking to
4291964 usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps that would probably be somewhere around it but i dont have it set
4291965 theres been a lot going on and theres been a lot of things hes had to get acclimated to whether its finding the lunch room or learning the playbook or studying film and all that stuff
4291966 hes doing a really really good job im really pleased
4291967 he looks the same because everyone out here is kind of tired and beat up right now physically and mentally
4291968 so we dont even notice it maybe someone that comes in here with fresh legs would notice it but none of us do
4291969 he looks like brett and all that aura around him and how he throws the ball thats all true hes looking great and i just know that hes played for so long and knows how to take care of his body whenever one comes my way i just try to catch what i can
4291970 i think he sees the play but sometimes it doesnt come off his tongue maybe as fast as he wants it to because hes doing it one way for a long time but you definitely see him making strides
4291971 before when you had to repeat it two or three times now you do it one time and he looks at you and goes yeah ive got that
4291972 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4291973 hes always had a good feel for solving problems he might not be able to put it in our terminology but he knows ive got a problem over there and im going to bail myself out over here thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that when youre dealing with a smart guy who has played as much as he has theres really not much he hasnt seen
4291974 i think the gunslinger tag is maybe a little bit unfair because hes got a great feel for whats going on
4291975 and just sitting around and watching film with him or talking to him during the course of practice hell say hey i saw this guy push over on the back side vs cover 4 i knew i was singled over there thats something some quarterbacks have some quarterbacks dont he definitely has that ability to see things
4291976 we are very excited to be representing purefcuk in the north america and european markets
4291977 the line has great potential with professional looking box artwork and videography the models are fresh and the sex is hot which is exactly what consumers are demanding
4291978 we at team love would like to congratulate all the participants and companies that placed orders during the show
4291979 im very pleased that one of our preferred distributors won the 15 percent show order discount contest christies sales and that the ophoria line received such a phenomenal response everyone here is ecstatic that weve become such a trusted name in the adult novelty industry and that our dedication to quality research development and materials has enabled us to achieve a high level of customer attraction and retention
4291980 reliability is paramount to success in the adult toy industry and lovers choice placed a premium on reliable supply as well as design and quality when developing the ophoria line
4291981 we also designed ophorias stylish deluxe packaging to help our distributors move the product quickly and earn robust sales all of these elements add up to a superior product and were very excited that the ophoria brand has been so well received by the industry we feel this acceptance is a testament to the quality of our product offering and will use it as a springboard for team loves ongoing commitment to customer satisfaction
4291982 honestly at that time the toys werent up to our strict standards so we delayed our launch
4291983 only now do we feel that the quality and consistency is there all of our products are phthalate free multispeed and waterproof in fact all of our products are completely submersible in addition we are offering unique packaging nothing will be in a traditional adult novelty package
4291984 its also important for people to know that every toy were putting out is our own mold and our own shape everything is 100 percent our own creation
4291985 nothing is a knockoff of another toy on the market we own the worldwide rights on every toy were putting out in the last three or four years weve asked a lot of questions and personally visited hundreds and hundreds of stores we wanted to find out what retailers needs were at a grassroots level after all this research we feel confident in where were at today
4291986 all of our toys are quality tested we really tried to go as high end as possible from the motors to the finish of the toy itself and even the stones used in some of the jewel encrusted vibrators we are only going to be releasing about six a month so we dont flood the market the first month youre going to see a couple of toys from each line were launching
4291987 were not coming into this with a haughty attitude or acting like we know everything
4291988 in the last few years weve been learning as weve gone along but weve remained consistent in our commitment to put out the best finished goods possible ultimately if we dont listen to what retailers want well look foolish we are trying to make something different we are trying to carve our own niche in the market without directly competing with the other companies
4291989 back then i was one of the first guys branding my packaging with foil
4291990 now you see it everywhere i had product recognition with that and still do but a lot of other companies followed suit just like with our dvds were focusing on quality and consistency with the evolved line job one of everyone who starts in the building regardless of what their position is is consistency were not trying to hit the ball out of the park were trying to make base hits all day long
4291991 we realized a lot of push button multifunction vibrators dont offer a master on off switch
4291992 people have trouble shutting it off which can obviously be a problem if youre using your vibrator and someone walks into the room our multifunction vibrators will allow users to shut them off immediately regardless of the speed or function it is set to
4291993 the philosophy we have as a company is that you buy a nice watch you buy a nice pair of sunglasses you get a case for them
4291994 you get something of value its one thing if youre buying a 10 item but when youre shelling out 100 and its in a cardboard box thats been on the shelf for three months with the paper torn and corners bashed in youre not a happy customer that isnt going to happen here
4291995 we wanted to provide a line of products that customers wouldnt necessarily have to worry about leaving out in plain sight
4291996 these do not look like porno items people expect a company like us with our library of adult star images to come out with a line that features naked girls instead were going with a more mainstream electronics or cosmetics packaging look and feel
4291997 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4291998 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4291999 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape

4292135 there is nothing that says this is arson to my knowledge
4292136 i know for a fact that no one was working the site at the time
4292137 within a matter of minutes the whole place was engulfed
4292138 you start drawing from all the hydrants so now your water pressure drops
4292139 youre going to have normal pressure problems these are the problems we ran into last night
4292140 our initial truck came down the road and when it got in there the front windshield melted and we had to back out
4292141 weve had a tragedy in the borough one unlike weve ever had before
4292142 we are a small community and our hearts reach out to everyone whos been affected
4292143 they gave as much information as they could trying to keep us up to date
4292144 beijar pen lope foi mais ou menos como beijar javier n o foi nada sexy atuamos num set cercado por uma equipe de 60 pessoas no set alguns almo ando outros filmando tentando captar o melhor ngulo
4292145 eu me senti absolutamente normal n o foi uma cena gratuita
4292146 no no it can be rescued and you know it
4292147 were asking that our children not only go to school but take another child with them
4292148 i dont have enough books to give every kid a book for them to be able to go home and do the homework assignment so i have to lessen what i do and do more in the classroom
4292149 if a kid is in front of me i can teach him
4292150 if we aint in school were out in the streets and thats why we have all these gang related problems
4292151 actually boardman was in the range of four times the amount you can perceive with the human eye
4292152 theyll be putting on new burner tips and making some changes to the way air flows through the boiler and getting about a 46 percent reduction then in phase two well require them to put on advanced control technology its the same thing that would be required at a brand new plant
4292153 what we need to look at is the cost effectiveness of what we do whether its pges proposal deqs proposal or something else in the end we need to be sure that the benefit the public and our customers will get from the money we spend is worth the amount that we spend
4292154 they chose the right control technologies but theyre giving pge far too long to install them
4292155 theyre talking about percent reduction sixty percent and eighty percent reduction a decade from now but they dont tell us what that number means
4292156 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects of the republican party
4292157 i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are prochoice
4292158 if i said i was running for eight years im not sure that would be a vote getter
4292159 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4292160 their message this morning has come out loud and clear they want to talk and ive said a number of times the door is open the phone is on lets have a discussion
4292161 for me its been encouraging that theyve understood the order of the court and they will abide by it until such time as we have a discussion which is important
4292162 there could be a range of things and that will probably unfold over the next week or so when we open some dialogue with them
4292163 im not sure where this will head but certainly its a different step for nrl clubs probably a different step for australian sport
4292164 i suppose its the first development that shows both sonny bill and toulon have recognised that any order of the supreme court is not something that you can take lightly
4292165 it is a serious piece of legistlation and he should act accordingly which he has done and thats a pleasing sign
4292166 its also important in that it shows cant ignore it the injunction irrelevant of where you are in the world
4292167 so people who say that contracts arent worth the piece of paper theyre written on i think this sends a very clear message that if youve got a contract and breach it and the supreme court then has a look at that then youve got some ramifications
4292168 when you come upon something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle up your spine

4292171 the only site with five thousand years of burials normally you get a snippet of time we have the green sahara written in those sand dunes and the people that lived in it
4292172 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert i realized we were in the green sahara
4292173 the child in the middle laid down second hands reaching over toward the mother and finally the child on the outside literally laid in hugging the other child reaching for the woman you see the articulation of all the hands over the top there this is a landmark burial there is nothing like it in prehistory id like to to turn the burial back around top side five thousand 300 years old we call it the stone age embrace
4292174 he experienced some discomfort after wednesdays game that we were aware of
4292175 he tried to address it thursday but it was a situation where it became more problematic
4292176 its the first time ive ever done six innings with only one catcher available
4292177 its a little different feeling when youre on the bench you just hope nothing happens to iannetta so you dont have to go paper rock scissors to pick another catcher
4292178 thats something very important to him its something we will consider
4292179 i spent most of the day today dealing with it
4292180 i thought we made progress but were still a long ways apart im waiting for them to come back to us they havent come off of their number
4292181 i had pain but now its just a little sore no big deal it feels better a lot better
4292182 especially tomorrow when he tries to stretch it out a little bit and that type of thing well have a better idea of where hes at and how far hes come back
4292183 it just depends on how well these guys continue to pitch
4292184 if we see a number of guys not having the same stuff then well probably have to make a decision
4292185 i think watching him the things he said he knows how much we want to win
4292186 i think he even said to me i dont want to be the weak link i appreciate that i understand that
4292187 were trying to win as many games as we can and help a young kid through a tough time
4292188 i think we all thought this was the right thing to do
4292189 a big part of our future and may well be a big part of our present
4292190 hes going through a time in his career that not many people dont do
4292191 most of them do it in the minor league level hes never had anything like this happen sometimes you need to take a step back in order to take a step forward i think hes ok i really do
4292192 were hoping he can get back on track and do what hes done in prior years
4292193 right now if i take the first pitch its right down the middle
4292194 if i swing at the first pitch its not i just have to find a little medium somewhere where i can be patient enough to wait on my pitch to hit
4292195 i still have the same swing i still have the same ability to hit but its just not working out the way i want it to right now
4292196 i just have to find a way to work through it
4292197 the last couple years ive been pretty good at pinch hitting
4292198 i think getting hurt early hurt me because i didnt get some of the at bats i might have gotten like against tampa bay as the designated hitter
4292199 im just trying to stay in the cage and keep hitting in there and work my way out of it
4292200 thats the advice my dad gave me too is keep working your way out something will click my patience is starting to run out though
4292201 i try to focus on the positives and work from there
4292202 you just have to stay positive the team is playing good and were winning but at the same time you want to be successful i dont know if i want to trade away my success for the teams success if the team is doing good it gives me some time to get back going
4292203 im not going to go to oakland with only five guys in the bullpen
4292204 we have to be really careful about what move were going to make
4292205 not having scott linebrink in the bullpen i know it would be a tough time losing one of those three guys
4292206 hopefully theyll have the confidence that if they need someone theyll know im going to give it my best and have confidence out there on the mound
4292207 i proved that i can do what i can do and handle that and just let the defense work for me
4292208 he did a good job a tremendous job better than we expected
4292209 he threw strikes he came up big in tough situations he ate up innings he got the win what could be better than that i think this game was big and he stepped it up and did his job
4292210 good thing we scored those runs in that inning because i didnt want to overuse dotel and bobby
4292211 every time theyre at the plate theyre in scoring position we have a lot of guys who can hit the ball out of the ballpark
4292212 it just kind of happened before we knew it it was out of nowhere it was actually a lot better game the whole way than the score indicated
4292213 its fine with me whatever they need its better than going back with a loss i got up here got a win things are pretty good
4292214 you could tell early on that both guys had good stuff and it was going to be that type of game
4292215 jake has pitched really well at home and sheets was an all star and hes thrown the ball great you could just sense right away that it was going to be a good one i think any fan of pitching or baseball enjoys those matchups
4292216 coming in we knew it would be hard to hang a lot of runs on sheets
4292217 so you just got to battle through it and fortunately we were able to grab a couple of runs in the seventh and get jake that win that he needed he deserved it
4292218 i thought initially that he hit the plate with his feet slid right through shouse
4292219 its hard to be an umpire im glad im a player cause i could never be an umpire hes got a tough job
4292220 what a day for the boys to come back and beat a guy like ben sheets
4292221 especially after going down one late when hes been so dominant throughout the game
4292222 jake did what he always does when hes out there and gave us a chance to win
4292223 it was nice to get back out there and start feeling like a baseball player again
4292224 id say i was a professional rehabber for a while so its good to get out here and do what you enjoy doing
4292225 itd just be good to get back out there feel strong get some at bats and get some momentum going into the offseason
4292226 now it feels strong and when you pick up a bat you want to hit
4292227 i wasnt able to raise my arm or really do anything
4292228 dealing with my dads death was probably the toughest thing i had to go through
4292229 it kind of just makes baseball seem pretty small in the grand scheme of things
4292230 hes worked so hard to build that strength back up the last thing you want to do is let it work its way in the other direction

4292233 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe
4292234 i realized that business was the way to go for me since then i have actively been seeking a double major degree in international business and marketing at florida international university i should be finished by 2009 its been a long road but definitely worth it
4292235 it was years ago when south beach was a totally different place i worked with michael tronn on the very successful sunday party anthem at crobar since then ive literally covered every inch of producing promoting marketing and planning different events and parties to art installations to assisting fashion shows for the miami gay amp lesbian film festival
4292236 i just love the ride that this industry has to offer the ups and down and the constant networking with people all over the globe this business has allowed me to meet and work in different levels with some of the worlds biggest names in music performance entertainment i do not think i would have been able to accomplish that as a mortician
4292237 in the times of and coliseum you could not get people to leave the party clubs closed at 5 am and everyone was there until then i think that part of the reason is because we are no longer just party monsters that only have retail or bartending jobs so many of us work in the medical field as doctors and as attorneys bankers brokers accountants business owners i would say that the vast majority of us hold high responsibilities and positions at work which make us go to bed early and put us in the office bright eyed in the morning
4292238 so the scene has evolved and its just different less drugs less endless nights of parties dont take me wrong we still have the appetite to have a great time and to look for excitement its just different
4292239 im a very good student with a high gpa and i am also a property owner i own rental properties throughout florida which is very stressful these days i have an enormous love for animals my mom is my number one love and really deep down inside i am a very sweet and simple guy
4292240 i like to hit the gym i am obsessed with play station 2 and love watching law and order but if i were to pick my favorite hobby it would have to be traveling i have been blessed to have the opportunity to travel a lot and have been to almost every crevasse of the earth
4292241 this way i can work to my up most capability
4292242 its hard to categorize me or label me in a way or another im very autonomous and versatile im constantly rolling with the punches and adapting to every situation im no where near being done or reaching my goals so i am pretty sure that there is a lot more of me to come

4292258 ive been in the final group of a couple tournaments and havent handled it all that well
4292259 yesterday i went out there and did my thing and played well
4292260 i felt today if i went out with the same mindset id be able to handle myself and shoot a good score
4292261 ive shot some really low numbers at school and ive shot in the 80s as well
4292262 its been good in spurts but i havent really been too consistent thats been the difference this summer

4292328 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4292329 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4292330 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4292331 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4292332 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4292333 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4292334 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4292335 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4292336 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4292337 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4292338 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4292339 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4292340 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4292341 datos concretos que sugieren la privaci n legal de la libertad seguida de muerte en la capital federal
4292342 no es un hecho de robo de la seguridad p blica sino que aparentemente tiene otro trasfondo que hay que investigar
4292343 este episodio no hay que mezclarlo con el tema de la inseguridad cotidiana creo que sobre el llanto de la gente que tambi n es el nuestro no hay que hacer pol tica
4292344 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4292345 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4292346 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4292347 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4292348 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4292349 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4292350 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4292351 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4292352 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4292353 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4292354 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4292355 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4292356 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4292357 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4292358 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4292359 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4292360 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4292361 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4292362 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4292363 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4292364 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4292365 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4292366 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4292367 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4292368 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4292369 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4292370 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4292371 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4292372 in the fast fuel episode ludacris and lees biodiesel tour buses are running on empty in the middle of the texas panhandle
4292373 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4292374 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4292375 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4292376 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4292377 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4292378 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4292379 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4292380 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it
4292381 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4292382 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4292383 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4292384 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4292385 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4292386 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4292387 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4292388 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4292389 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4292390 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4292391 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4292392 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4292393 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4292394 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4292395 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4292396 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
4292397 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4292398 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4292399 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4292400 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4292401 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4292402 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4292403 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4292404 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4292405 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4292406 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4292407 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4292408 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4292409 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4292410 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4292411 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4292412 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4292413 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4292414 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4292415 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4292416 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4292417 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4292418 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4292419 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4292420 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4292421 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4292422 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4292423 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4292424 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4292425 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4292426 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4292427 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4292428 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4292429 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4292430 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4292431 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4292432 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4292433 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4292434 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4292435 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4292436 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4292437 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4292438 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4292439 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
4292440 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
4292441 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
4292442 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
4292443 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4292444 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4292445 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4292446 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4292447 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4292448 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4292449 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
4292450 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4292451 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
4292452 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
4292453 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
4292454 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
4292455 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
4292456 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4292457 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4292458 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4292459 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4292460 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4292461 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4292462 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4292463 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4292464 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4292465 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4292466 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4292467 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4292468 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4292469 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4292470 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4292471 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4292472 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4292473 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4292474 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4292475 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4292476 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4292477 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4292478 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4292479 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4292480 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4292481 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4292482 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4292483 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4292484 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4292485 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4292486 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4292487 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4292488 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4292489 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4292490 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4292491 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4292492 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4292493 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4292494 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4292495 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4292496 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4292497 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4292498 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4292499 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4292500 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4292501 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4292502 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4292503 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4292504 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4292505 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4292506 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4292507 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4292508 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4292509 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4292510 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4292511 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4292512 who will be the next president of the united states
4292513 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4292514 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4292515 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4292516 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4292517 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4292518 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4292519 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4292520 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4292521 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4292522 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4292523 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4292524 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4292525 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4292526 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4292527 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4292528 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4292529 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4292530 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4292531 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4292532 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4292533 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4292534 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4292535 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4292536 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4292537 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4292538 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4292539 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4292540 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4292541 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4292542 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4292543 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4292544 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4292545 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4292546 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4292547 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4292548 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4292549 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4292550 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4292551 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4292552 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4292553 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4292554 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4292555 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4292556 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4292557 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4292558 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4292559 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4292560 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4292561 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4292562 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4292563 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4292564 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4292565 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4292566 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4292567 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4292568 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4292569 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4292570 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4292571 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4292572 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4292573 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4292574 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4292575 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4292576 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4292577 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4292578 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4292579 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4292580 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4292581 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4292582 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4292583 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4292584 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4292585 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4292586 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4292587 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4292588 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4292589 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4292590 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4292591 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4292592 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4292593 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4292594 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4292595 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4292596 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4292597 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4292598 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4292599 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4292600 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4292601 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4292602 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4292603 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4292604 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4292605 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4292606 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4292607 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4292608 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4292609 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4292610 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4292611 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4292612 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4292613 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4292614 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4292615 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4292616 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4292617 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4292618 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4292619 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4292620 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4292621 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4292622 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
4292623 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4292624 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4292625 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4292626 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4292627 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4292628 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4292629 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4292630 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4292631 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4292632 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4292633 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4292634 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4292635 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4292636 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4292637 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4292638 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4292639 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4292640 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4292641 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4292642 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4292643 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4292644 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4292645 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4292646 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4292647 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4292648 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4292649 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4292650 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4292651 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4292652 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4292653 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4292654 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4292655 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4292656 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4292657 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4292658 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4292659 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4292660 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4292661 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4292662 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4292663 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4292664 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4292665 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4292666 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4292667 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4292668 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4292669 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4292670 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4292671 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4292672 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4292673 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4292674 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4292675 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4292676 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4292677 who are open to doing something on the production side
4292678 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4292679 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4292680 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4292681 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4292682 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4292683 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4292684 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4292685 lossezia non liraq non serve inviare le nostre truppe bastano gli osservatori dellonu
4292686 no alle fughe in avanti cos rischiamo solo di continuare la confusione
4292687 in ossezia c un popolo che sta lottando per difendere la sua indipendenza
4292688 non capisco che senso abbia una proposta del genere e inopportuna sia nei toni che nel merito si rischia di ottenere leffeto contrario mi sembra pi luscita di chi non vuole affrontare il nodo del problema ma solo lasciarsi lagosto dietro le spalle
4292689 lasciamo lavorare leuropa e il presidente nicolas sarkozy in ossezia semmai servono di pi gli osservatori dellonu per capire una volte per tutte cosa sta succedendo veramente
4292690 da una parte c la russia del presidente putin che ha annunciato il cessate il fuoco dallaltra per ci sono le autorit georgiane che sostengono che al contrario ci sono ancora delle operazioni in corso prima di tutto bisogna ristabilire la verit dobbiamo uscire dal rimpallo delle responsabilit di solito prima si individua il problema e solo dopo si cerca di risolverlo
4292691 le decisioni du temi delicati come questo si possono prendere su dati certi non sulle voci inoltre se si vuole avere un minimo effetto deterrente nei confronti di chi vuole usare la forza serve una presa di posizione di tutta la comunit internazionale non di un singolo paese solo seguendo questa strada si ottiene lobiettivo e soprattutto si fa in modo che ciascuno si assuma le proprie responsabilit
4292692 certamente ma anche alleuropa e il momento di lasciar lavorare la diplomazia non le armi non dimentichiamo che linvio degli osservatori delle nazioni unite pu avere un effetto preventivo
4292693 le prese di posizioni di singoli paesi di solito non hanno alcun peso anzi spesso diventano un pretesto per gli altri per non farsi carico del problema
4292694 la questione unaltra se la russia vuole veramente come dice da tempo entrare stabilmente nel mondo occidentale deve dimostrare una volta per tutte di rispettare i nostri principi non a giorni alterni ma in modo definitivo
4292695 mi auguro che il presidente del consiglio riesca ad ottenere da putin delle risposte che dimostrino una volte per tutte che tra loro due esiste un dialogo veramente privilegiato intendo dire che si basa sulla sostanza e non solo sulla forma
4292696 francamente mi sembrato uno scatto in avanti tardivo in altre occasioni quando era in gioco il petrolio che lui conosce molto bene lo abbiamo visto scaldarsi molto di pi
4292697 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4292698 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4292699 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4292700 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4292701 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4292702 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4292703 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4292704 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4292705 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4292706 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4292707 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4292708 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4292709 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4292710 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4292711 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4292712 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4292713 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4292714 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4292715 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4292716 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4292717 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4292718 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4292719 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4292720 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4292721 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4292722 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4292723 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4292724 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4292725 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4292726 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4292727 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4292728 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4292729 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4292730 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4292731 we have sponsorship agreements or relationships with sick kids and the united way
4292732 a t one point it was alleged that there were 180 000 names on the waiting list if that is the case why can fans suddenly buy single game tickets for tonight
4292733 no doubt there are nfl fans in our midst plenty of them but it is still worth noting that only the cheapest seats are sold out for tonights game and at 70 a pop cheapest is relative
4292734 60 000 more of the unis to fulfill demand mort also reports that nfl players get 6 from each sale
4292735 i miss the steinbrenners shoot i even miss randy levine
4292736 i do know that dodger owner frank mccourt would love to bring lucchino to the dodgers to straighten out the archaic mess in la but i was also told by someone close to larry and with the red sox that there is no way that john henry and tom werner would let larry go
4292737 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for gen musharraf
4292738 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4292739 who would have ever thought it would be zardari accusing someone else of embezzlement
4292740 hey you ride with orlando in the truck were going to get your bike

4292748 your riding buddies have all the rooms you stay in our house tonight
4292749 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4292750 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4292751 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4292752 our family has always loved this house and appreciated the history of this house
4292753 that said there are things we would like to do that you cant do with a house this size and this age
4292754 if i can see on paper where it is economically feasible to go the restoration route i would do it
4292755 what sharepoint content references locations within x miles of abc company
4292756 does the spreadsheet contain points of interest pois within the tsunami region
4292757 local foods connection combats hunger and supports small farmers non profit organization creates new market for farmers and introduces low income iowans to fresh local produce
4292758 i found that clients dont recognize so many of the vegetables they dont have the equipment to prepare the vegetables they havent really cooked much fresh food in their life and their neighbors and their families dont have experience doing this and so they were calling me and saying laura what the heck do i do with this stuff so we had to slowly integrate more and more educational opportunities
4292759 be happy on your own and then share that happiness with someone else
4292760 well youll meet the right person when the time is right
4292761 it is like a fire everything that is thrown into the fire is consumed
4292762 this product will literally destroy all harmful organisms on the
4292763 the mom is in town today and wants to come to see the house
4292764 they are begging me the mom wants to come in and see the house she knows your packing and doesnt care about how the house looks she just wants to see it since she bought it sight unseen
4292765 its not my problem she bought a house her kid picked i dont want her to come in here and nick pick about something and jeopordize anything tell them no its not my problem and the mom seeing the house was never part of the deal
4292766 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
4292767 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
4292768 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
4292769 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
4292770 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
4292771 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
4292772 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
4292773 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
4292774 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
4292775 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
4292776 but the autumn is so beautiful the leaves are all orange and red
4292777 cortez is rapidly becoming a killer band in boston if theres such a thing as classic stoner rock these guys are doing it
4292778 its fun for us to see what can happen with that and to try and find our inner tom verlaine and neil young
4292779 we also have a goal of not making the songs too long so again its a balance and one in which the adverts will always win out over the allman brothers but maybe not the yardbirds
4292780 i just came back from new york city and moved in with chris
4292781 at that point he already had the idea that we should be in a band together and had some songs he wanted me to sing
4292782 but we didnt tell anyone about the project until months later until we were completely sure
4292783 we booked our first show before we even played together with the band
4292784 the commitment to the band is more mental than physical we dont practice were not running the songs into the ground at the rehearsal space but theres a certain spark and spontaneity because of that
4292785 hailing from tampa florida the founding members of the atmospheric post rock group windsor for the derby guitarists dan matz and jason mcneeley along with drummer greg anderson soon migrated to austin texas where they were signed to the local trance syndicate label their debut lp 1996s calm hades float was produced and engineered by adam witzie who agreed to become a full time windsor for the derby member shortly after the projects completion after issuing the ep metropolitan then poland in early 1997 the group closed out the year with the release of the full length minnie greunzfeldt in 1999 they returned with difference and repetition three years later they appeared with a b sides collection earnest powers on emperor jones the band also scaled down in this time period leaving only matz and mcneeley from the original lineup spacey folk texture crept into the 2002 aesthetic release emotional rescue 2004s we fight til death featured halting vocals and a greater instrumental palette to work from after the album both mcneeley and matz ended up living in philadelphia previously theyd converged somewhere once or twice a year to work on material and putting down roots let them experiment more in a home studio as well as play frequent live shows they also added to the lineup drummer charlie hall and keyboardist and bassist ann neighbor giving up the ghost reflected these changes when it appeared from secretly canadian in august 2005 though neighbor was credited alongside matz and mcneely gianmarco cilli national eye handled drums on the album how we lost arrived in early 2008
4292786 inspired inspiring and the rare kinda thing that actually gives a burnout like me hope if i could grow more thumbs theyd all be up
4292787 anthems ma create the kind of thrilling pulsing soundscapes that my bloody valentine would have done had they hung out with their more up tempo contemporaries this is clever music with its eyes firmly on the listener separating them from shoegazer revivalists elsewhere
4292788 believes that president bush is trying to merge the united states with mexico and canada
4292789 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to
4292790 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4292791 he would come home very late drunk and i could hear him shouting at ruth telling her to cook him food then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat he would talk about how unhappy he was and how he had been betrayed
4292792 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book without their constant love and support without their willingness to let me sing their song and their toleration of the occasional wrong note i could never have hoped to finish if nothing else i hope that the love and respect i feel for them shines through on every page
4292793 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4292794 i was reading that document the other day and what i found very interesting is that throughout the whole document something comes up over and over and over mary was given this especial grace of being assumed to heaven with her body and her soul because it was her whole person her body and soul who gave birth to the savior of the world if we put this in plain language it was all about her baby those women here present who have ever been pregnant know well what i am talking about when a woman gets pregnant her life goes through a total transformation from that point on her life is about her baby a baby changes everything does that sound familiar marys baby changed her life as well first because it was a baby and second because it wasnt just any baby but the messiah the savior of the world todays passage from luke depicts three months of marys pregnancy three months that she did not spent at home but miles away from home at s house probably helping her with the shores because of the encountering of these two pregnant women is powerful s baby leaped for joy and elizabeth knows when that mary is the bearer of the savior for that reason calls her blessed and blesses also the fruit of her womb marys baby is the main character of the scene in the gospel also mary pronounces a song a song that is known as the magnificat magnificat anima mea dominum my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord in this song she recalls all the blessings that god has bestowed on his people but she inverts the roles blessed are not the rich and the wise no blessed are the lowly the humble those who fear the lord the hungry the servants and she closes this magnificent hymn by telling that god has indeed remembered the promise he made to her ancestors that promise was in her womb it was all about marys baby throughout jesus life mary was always there her life was always concentrated on her son jesus could have been 30 when he began to preach but for her he was always her baby dont you moms act that way the son would be like mom i am fifty years old
4292795 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4292796 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4292797 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4292798 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4292799 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4292800 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4292801 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4292802 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
4292803 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all
4292804 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4292805 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4292806 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4292807 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here
4292808 eucom forces will remain ready to support as further needs are assessed
4292809 b ut also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
4292810 a majority of the decision makers in europe agreed on a strategy of doing nothing to offend muslims and terrorism will disappear it led to demand after demand after demand to the point that the archbishop of canterbury is saying sharia law is an inevitability
4292811 there will be no large demonstrations of moderate muslims taking to the street saying please dont offend us
4292812 im not na ve about the fact that this kind of stuff can spread like wild fire
4292813 i also think that we cant be paralyzed by that kind of fear we need to be smarter than that fear
4292814 if they cant figure out how to outsmart a bunch of radical violent extremists who can
4292815 i do not want to spend any more energy discussing my book before it is published
4292816 a novel of womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith
4292817 i felt it was my professional responsibility to counter this novels fallacious representation of a very real womans life the author and the press brought me into a process and i used my scholarly expertise to assess the novel it was in that same professional capacity that i felt it my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
4292818 the spark that prompted them to start raising the red flags
4292819 anyone should have the right to publish whatever they want about islam or muslims even if their views are offensive without fear of censorship or retribution muslims however shouldnt be expected to be passive consumers of these views an offended muslim has the right indeed the responsibility to vigorously critique anything written about them or their religion provided they do not cross the line into intimidation and coercion in an ideal world both parties would open their minds enough to understand the other point of view getting people on both sides of this equation to follow these guidelines will take a lot of reconditioning but the alternative a hyper sensitive muslim community that is unable to constructively respond to external criticism or internal criticism for that matter coupled with a journalistic artistic secular community that feels genuine fear and is prevented from free expression cannot be an option we are witnessing today the stagnation and increased misunderstanding that comes from a stifled discourse
4292820 as a journalist for the last 28 years i hold the right to free speech especially dear the first amendment is in my view the very best thing about living in the united states publishing houses can of course do whatever they want but university professors ms spellberg urged random house to abstain from publishing the reason she is telling reporters now is that she doesnt like my book does this development mean our public universities no longer support the free exchange of ideas
4292821 dont have a history of pulling things thoughtlessly or in a knee jerk way
4292822 they are supposed to stand up for their right to say what they want especially in a work of fiction
4292823 you cant restrict speech based on the crankiest member of the community and the most reckless member of the community
4292824 there is so much out there about the wives of the prophet that offends rational people its all in defense of polygamy telling us fables of how all these women lived happily together
4292825 i expect there are any number of publishers who will say thank you random house for making all this free publicity for us
4292826 none of the secrets of success will work unless you do
4292827 a great fortune will find you just sit around and wait for it to find you
4292828 ok you wont be able to see hardly anything since your eyes are now so painfully sensitive to light and the sun is really out there today isnt it so try to not run over anybody good luck with those traffic lights up against that o so brightly lit blue sky
4292829 we are confident that we will have something quite good to announce in the next couple of months
4292830 pay record labels for songs illegally downloaded by its customers
4292831 obviously in the light of all the interest in isps potentially working with music companies i think thats led to a lot of the speculation
4292832 there was never any discussion of any levy or tax or anything resembling that whatsoever
4292833 isps new music service will pay labels for illegal downloads
4292834 you really need to go there and familiarise yourself with the country the wickets and the conditions
4292835 its all good and well to train here but the conditions are so different sometimes that if we go a few days early that wouldnt bother me because i think it will be very important for my preparation to get acclimatised to those conditions it can be very different and daunting but its a challenge and if we go early it wouldnt hurt anyone
4292836 at the moment the champions trophy is still going ahead so we can only plan as if that is going to happen the ideal situation wont be that we go to darwin for one dayers then home for two and a half weeks then go to india we will certainly have some other things on the go
4292837 you hear about australia closing its embassies in pakistan what are you supposed to think and the back up country has its own problems
4292838 once again im going to have to look at that report and see what it says
4292839 if we do go itll be on the basis of that all has been taken care of and that unease factor will hopefully be removed theres obviously something going on although im only hearing it second hand
4292840 its very important that that part of the world keeps playing cricket
4292841 obviously those countries are struggling but if it doesnt happen i hope they do whatever they need to rectify the situation
4292842 prices have fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets
4292843 furthermore the momentum of buying is likely to continue in light of the housing stimulus package that was recently enacted
4292844 graduated from aveda and moving home next weekend i pray i am making the right choice to move home
4292845 the researchers bombarded the metals zirconium and aluminum with positively charged ions of argon gas in a vacuum chamber the argon ions caused metal atoms to be ejected and a reaction with nitrogen in the chamber resulted in the deposition of aluminum nitride and zirconium nitride onto the silicon surface the gallium nitride was then deposited by another common technique known as organometallic vapor phase epitaxy performed in a chamber called a reactor at temperatures of about 1 000 degrees celsius or 1 800 degrees fahrenheit

4292884 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
4292885 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
4292886 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone

4292893 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

4292903 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4292904 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4292905 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4292906 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4292907 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4292908 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4292909 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4292910 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4292911 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4292912 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4292913 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4292914 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4292915 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4292916 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4292917 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4292918 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4292919 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4292920 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw

4292923 turbulence caused by external factors is changing the automotive industry like never before and energy has become a major point of concern since it touches virtually every aspect of our lives
4292924 the global growth in demand for oil is outpacing its availability which will ultimately result in energy scarcity likely before we develop advanced energy technologies that will be enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4292925 imagine we have developed advanced technologies for solar wind hydro energy and its storage sufficient enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4292926 we need to improve our industrys readiness for upcoming change
4292927 if we do this right my deep belief is that this industry can go beyond that and be the leaders in developing the right solutions to address these complex energy and mobility challenges

4292960 we lost 135 guys we can kill people now we were ordered when fired upon hunker down with radio waiting for orders to return fire in april they told us in a crowded area if one person shoots at you kill everybody because they are letting them attack you they are no longer innocent if theyre there at the time of the crime sounds like a criminal rule if your buddy commits a crime and youre there you caught up on charges on it but these arent charges these are deaths were killing people because theyre there when someone else attacked us because we believe that if we kill enough innocent people they will stop the people from attacking us but what they dont realize is the people we killed it was their brother it was their uncle that was trying to kill us because we already killed his three children you roll into baghdad every single big apartment building is blown up every single apartment building in baghdad has been broken to the ground by artillery and airplanes bombing you cannot meet someone in iraq who has not lost a family member could you imagine what wed have done in america if in 9 11 everybody in america lost a family member would we be talking about war no wed be in the streets with weapons and so people talk about these people killed an american soldier in iraq theyre terrorists theyre not terrorists theyre wearing sandals and they got an ak and they have 14 year old boys building bombs to kill those american soldiers because weve killed their family

4292991 in order to preserve the integrity of canadas judicial system we respectfully ask that you consider this complaint seriously investigate beverley mclachlins inappropriate behaviour and recommend to parliament that she be removed from office

4293001 keeps the eggs from getting too hot and makes it homogenous and creamy
4293002 i find that the way to get really moist and creamy scrambled eggs is to prepare them in a double boiler or in an earthen bowl set over simmering water
4293003 the double boiler is narrow so there is less of a chance of creating a lot of curds

4293009 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4293010 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4293011 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4293012 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4293013 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4293014 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4293015 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4293016 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4293017 this matter of kashmir is not indias internal affair it is as much a matter for pakistan as it is for kashmiris
4293018 i didnt assume that whatever bob joseph and i agreed upon was going right into the presidents desk in the oval office
4293019 within this context now finally clarified by foley bob josephs decision to make an unremarkable call to a friend who rarely saw tenet or his seventh floor disciples and not tell this friend that hes the last check in one of modern historys most contentious phrases before it ends up on the presidents lips was a perfect way to get something cia doubted and its director had already opposed into the big speech
4293020 believed there may well have been something to the claims that the iraqis sought to purchase uranium from niger
4293021 the italian letter how the bush administration used a fake letter to build the case for war in iraq
4293022 if the president wants to go to war our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so
4293023 i was told that foley had focused on clearing the speech for sources and methods rather than for substance
4293024 in other words as long as the language didnt give away any secrets about how the intelligence was collected they didnt worry about whether we believed the assertions in the speech were accurate that was a terrible mistake our job was never to clear solely for sources and methods but also for substance and the last time i looked as good as the british intelligence service is and it is very good it does not work for the president of the united states
4293025 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4293026 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4293027 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4293028 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4293029 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4293030 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4293031 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4293032 is it me or is it this plan that owes this money and needs to pay this bill

4293034 he lives in a town like 13 odd miles away
4293035 i honestly do not know how the fuck that happened
4293036 he seems unusually on edge and is making mistakes he shouldnt
4293037 his misstep last night claiming infidelity as a weakness for the democrats evidently forgetting about mccains dalliances shows hannitys not on his game
4293038 its the right direction to go and somebody has to say move as opposed to standing around talking about it

4293042 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4293043 again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows

4293047 if it looks easy maybe that gives me an advantage
4293048 whether i start the sixth or the ninth i have the same approach
4293049 maybe after its all over i might get a chance to sit back and reflect on it when im on the mound im thinking about getting outs
4293050 i would have been a fairly generic pitcher even had i gained a couple of miles an hour pitching overhand

4293053 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4293054 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4293055 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4293056 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4293057 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4293058 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4293059 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4293065 early research carried out by etag has concluded that the creation of the uks first tourism business improvement district should be the way forward and the next step is to explore this option in more details and carry out further consultation
4293066 the legislation is in place to allow a bid to be set up it would basically be up to the industry in the city to develop a proposal and then put it to the vote as happened with the city centre scheme earlier this year
4293067 edinburgh cannot be complacent in the face of an increasingly competitive global tourism market
4293068 other cities are investing heavily in the visitor experience and using a range of new funding mechanisms to do so
4293069 im delighted that the scottish government has agreed to support edinburgh in developing the concept of a tourism bid

4293072 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4293073 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality

4293077 its a cultural phenomenon we have to address as a public health problem
4293078 this is not solely a law or a legislative issue its a community issue that puts at risk every single citizen and every single visitor in our state every single day someone in wisconsin will die because of a drunken driver we as a society have let this go on and on and on
4293079 we are the worst in the nation in traffic fatalities caused by drunk driving we are the worst for underage drinking and binge drinking for fetal alcohol syndrome and in women drinking
4293080 we have got to change the culture driving this state
4293081 there has to be a better way this is my promise to come up with another round of reforms what do we want to do differently
4293082 as we say in the south this was not his first rodeo he had driven drunk plenty of times he was just never caught
4293083 we have got to stop the revolving door the catch and release system for repeat offenders
4293084 i asked for beer but they wanted me to get drunk
4293085 its been very helpful it gives me a much better sense of whats on peoples minds
4293086 i think she wont come in with a preconceived notion about wholesale changes in staffing
4293087 over time im sure she will without a doubt ive been in this job almost eight years theres been a tremendous amount of turnover over that time
4293088 by settling this lawsuit we can put this incident behind us and we can focus on our responsibility for those in our care and those we employ
4293089 although there remains a dispute over what events actually occurred it is clear that there was inappropriate contact
4293090 the department of health services and mendota officials took these allegations very seriously
4293091 i hear the savior say thy strength indeed is small child of weakness watch and pray find in me thine all in all

4293094 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4293095 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4293096 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4293097 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalog
4293098 we tease him and he goes im a little bit fatigued like we all are but i say yeah but youre old
4293099 its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what were sticking to
4293100 usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps that would probably be somewhere around it but i dont have it set
4293101 theres been a lot going on and theres been a lot of things hes had to get acclimated to whether its finding the lunch room or learning the playbook or studying film and all that stuff
4293102 hes doing a really really good job im really pleased
4293103 he looks the same because everyone out here is kind of tired and beat up right now physically and mentally
4293104 so we dont even notice it maybe someone that comes in here with fresh legs would notice it but none of us do
4293105 he looks like brett and all that aura around him and how he throws the ball thats all true hes looking great and i just know that hes played for so long and knows how to take care of his body whenever one comes my way i just try to catch what i can
4293106 i think he sees the play but sometimes it doesnt come off his tongue maybe as fast as he wants it to because hes doing it one way for a long time but you definitely see him making strides
4293107 before when you had to repeat it two or three times now you do it one time and he looks at you and goes yeah ive got that
4293108 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4293109 hes always had a good feel for solving problems he might not be able to put it in our terminology but he knows ive got a problem over there and im going to bail myself out over here thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that when youre dealing with a smart guy who has played as much as he has theres really not much he hasnt seen
4293110 i think the gunslinger tag is maybe a little bit unfair because hes got a great feel for whats going on
4293111 and just sitting around and watching film with him or talking to him during the course of practice hell say hey i saw this guy push over on the back side vs cover 4 i knew i was singled over there thats something some quarterbacks have some quarterbacks dont he definitely has that ability to see things
4293112 i know exactly what youre saying when i was younger my dad is from nepal i used to tell people my name was karen cause it was very strange to be named kiran in elementary school

4293116 weve been to the afl players association weve asked them to go check the ground and at this stage we dont have a final result on that
4293117 if its found that its not a safe workplace then i would think thats probably going to be a thing that well follow up

4293120 in recognition of the special educational needs of low income families and the impact that concentrations of low income families have on the ability of local educational agencies to support adequate educational programs the congress hereby declares it to be the policy of the united states to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies serving areas with concentrations of children from low income families to expand and improve their educational programs by various means including preschool programs which contribute to meeting the special educational needs of educationally deprived children
4293121 to set standards and enforce standards and raise standards and raise them ever more was nearly the whole duty of teachers principals and presidents
4293122 when the company sets out to be the producer in the industry
4293123 we want littlebigplanet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3 this is a very big title for us
4293124 a lot of people talk about us and say we play good football adebayor said
4293125 good football is good but we didnt win anything and you play to win
4293126 what we are going to keep in our heads is that playing football is good but sometimes you have to be tough to win a game thats what we have to do sometimes you have to be dirty to win some games
4293127 you need to do that because its part of football sometimes you have to forget about trying to play beautiful football and just make sure you win the game when i signed for arsenal i knew i had the chance to win a lot of things
4293128 ive been here for almost three years and still havent won anything its difficult last year we were very very close to winning something but ended up winning nothing
4293129 of course we have the mental strength we have a young team with good talented players
4293130 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4293131 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point
4293132 however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4293133 if were talking about 15 dead whales a year now in one week were about at half of what we normally have in a year so it is quite particular
4293134 what sparked our concern is that were talking about different components in the food web that seem to be affected by something
4293135 it could be pure coincidence of independent events happening simultaneously
4293136 we are planning to release it in a pen complete with a pond and a natural environment
4293137 rank with over fishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as global environmental problems
4293138 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen
4293139 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4293140 to keep fertilizers on the land and out of the sea
4293141 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4293142 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimize the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4293143 i think that other teams fear us because of our results against some of the bigger nations drawing with italy and beating france home and away
4293144 you need to win your home games to give yourself a chance of progressing however and weve tended to do better away from home in recent seasons
4293145 weve played a counter attacking game in those matches so maybe it will suit us to have our opening two matches against macedonia and iceland away from home next month
4293146 however its really important that we beat northern ireland at hampden next week because that will give us more confidence to take into those ties
4293147 this new technology is allowing us to image the sea floor in unprecedented detail and is providing valuable information about the huge scale and immense power of these giant submarine flows
4293148 we have found that giant landslides are actually quite rare around the canary islands with no major activity in the last 15 000 years
4293149 at the moment we dont even know where the lisbon quake originated
4293150 we hope that new data from the deep ocean will provide information about the potential future threat to coastal communities
4293151 increasingly the clubs who are promoted are those that benefit from a parachute payment following relegation from the premier league or have a benefactor he said
4293152 the championship is a competitive and compelling division but it is a loss making division the top eight last season to a greater or lesser degree enjoyed either a parachute payment or a benefactor
4293153 the disparity between premier league and the football league is so great that it requires a whopping investment when you get there you cant hope to succeed if you go into the premier league and just take the money to rebuild the stadium or pay off the bank but for well run clubs with backing theres a great incentive to try to finish 17th
4293154 all football league clubs have to specify in their contracts the salaries including the effects of promotion and relegation for the following season which does at least make directors think about the consequences
4293155 that is fine for aspiring players who are desperate to join you but it does make it difficult to persuade players from other premier league clubs to come to you
4293156 only once have all the promoted clubs gone straight back down
4293157 i saw a menacing shape in the water and it looked huge as big as a shark
4293158 there were a few fish in the harbour at high tide and the seal had managed to out swim one and pounce
4293159 a tackle that endangers the safety of an opponent must be sanctioned as serious foul play and so earn a red card any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front from the side or from behind using one or both legs with excessive force and endangering the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play
4293160 it gets worse if i have a cold i try to stay healthy but catching a cold is a professional hazard it happens a few times a year
4293161 it may be 48 degrees outside but the temperature in the tank is maintained at 27 degrees i soak myself in water up to my waist for five to 10 minutes before entering the tank
4293162 you have to get used to breathing through your mouth its a bit like snorkelling only it lasts for three hours
4293163 i do it voluntarily i have on many occasions been to the bottom of the creek 20 feet and brought back wallets rings radios mobile phones etc rings are the hardest to find
4293164 they are like my friends when i finish cleaning the tank i just stand still for a while so they can come close to me and play with me one butterfly fish has really taken a shine to me and comes and kisses the side of my neck it is actually a painful prick but she doesnt know it so i let her do that
4293165 do you know how to tell if a fish is sick
4293166 it is attacked by other fish for not joining them the world of fish works a little differently than that of us humans
4293167 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4293168 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality
4293169 algae suffering from lead poisoning like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins
4293170 we had one where we had to dig into someone and pull a tooth out
4293171 hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4293172 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault
4293173 it was just bad luck with injuries hes got to be judged on what happens from now somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and its him because of the demand at west ham for success but the odds on him going will change if we stick two or three wins together
4293174 when we first saw stumpy in hervey bay in 2001 we thought for sure he wouldnt survive without his tail
4293175 its a 20 000 kilometre return journey when they migrate and that is an amazing feat for a whale without a tail
4293176 human activities really screwed up oxygen conditions in our coastal areas
4293177 the next big challenge after global warming is going to be addressing the massive upset of the worlds nitrogen cycle
4293178 mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences
4293179 the most fun ive had in the theater since maybe earlier 2008
4293180 i shot a little picture called the thin red line heard of it
4293181 there are plenty of actors who are brilliant people and plenty who should not be allowed on talk shows

4293185 all threatened salmon populations will likely show reductions in viability
4293186 it seems to be a very thoughtful and fair opinion
4293187 these are pesticides that epa has swept under the rug for years
4293188 these are three that stood out as the nastiest of the pesticides that are still in widespread use
4293189 we will be working in epa over the next month or so to find out if we can find a reasonable and prudent alternative
4293190 thats what happens if you hold them in that concentration for four days that never happens in the real world
4293191 it tends to be a pulse and then its gone
4293192 very very very low levels levels that are far far below what have ever been considered cause for concern
4293193 population abundance likely would decline and recovery efforts would be slowed risk of extinction would increase substantially
4293194 we do not know if there is a manufacturing fault a user fault or a dud batch
4293195 being at the last all star game at the old place was such a thrill and to link the two together is going to be pretty neat
4293196 obviously it is going to be a very special day
4293197 theres so much history with the yankees and with the new stadium i am sure a lot of people who have meant a lot to this game will be there that day
4293198 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4293199 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information
4293200 im personally not up to date on the facts so i dont wanna make a stupid choice for our country i want to vote but only when i know exactly whats going on more ppl should think like that paris hilton said yaaaay go vote cause its cool and hott she wasnt even registered

4293206 the year is 2008 and the world teeters on the brink of war radical ultranationalists have seized power in moscow their goal the reestablishment of the old soviet empire ukraine belarus and kazakhstan one by one the nearby independent republics slip back into the russian orbit russian tanks sit in the caucasus mountains and the baltic forests poised to strike to the south and east the world holds its breath and waits
4293207 what were trying to do is understand the basic biology of the system and in the future we hope to build on that in order to achieve regeneration
4293208 the clinical pay off is close i think but the basic science thats being funded will also allow stem cells to be used for other kinds of assays that im convinced will lead to new drug therapies

4293210 creativity is a type of learning process where the teacher and the pupil are located in the same individual
4293211 you know i thought about that and then i remembered she said mrs gibson and i would have loved each other because we both loved embroidery handwork pretty stuff not necessarily functional embroidery but stitching the stuff that served no more purpose than adding a little beauty to the world i guess she wanted me to have it because maybe mrs gibson and i were soul sisters over all these many years
4293212 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4293213 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

4293223 eight states have enacted laws requiring first time convicted drunk drivers to have an ignition interlock device installed on their vehicle and wisconsin should do the same
4293224 once the sentencing take place there is really no way to determine or ensure compliance with that order from that point on
4293225 we arrest a lot of drunk drivers in this state however were just barely scratching the surface law enforcement cant do this alone we need help and we need it desperately to stop the carnage on our highways needless carnage because of drunk driving
4293226 al narcotr fico no lo vamos a derrotar nombrando comisiones por dem s ilegales para hacer publicidad y ganar tiempo mientras se dejan diluir los graves sucesos ocurridos en ban

4293256 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4293257 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4293258 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4293259 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4293260 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4293261 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4293262 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans

4293332 on the very day last week that we were announcing in melbourne the largest seizure of ecstasy my officers in sydney were unpacking a sea container
4293333 that container had been targeted as the result of an operation being undertaken by the nsw crime commission and nsw police
4293334 the container was alleged to contain various foodstuffs and among the instant noodles instant rice and vermicelli was a number of cartons of what was alleged to be fruit juice

4293388 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4293389 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit

4293405 a disturbing thing with younger nurses is that because of the workload and just other nurses being too busy to do actual mentoring we are seeing high rates of nurses just saying after a couple of years i cant deal with this so they leave the profession altogether
4293406 its a real concern because when youre looking at an aging workforce you want to have nurses that are going to be in the system to replace the nurses that are retiring
4293407 and if theyre not there to replace them then whos going to get nursing care

4293418 russland tendiert dazu die zentralasiatische region von direktem zugang zur weltwirtschaft zu isolieren insbesondere zur energieversorgung wenn die georgische regierung destabilisiert wird bedeutet das weitere einschr nkung f r den zugriff des westens auf baku das kaspischen meer und andere orte

4293427 digital imaging for mammography at least when were looking at quality is at least as good
4293428 in some cases when we look at patients younger patients with very glandular or very dense breasts and peri menopausal or pre menopausal women that study did conclude digital mammography was the best choice
4293429 we are trying to minimize that impact by continuing to bring in locum support as we have for the last year for mammography
4293430 once we move to digital mammography then we can look at how we can transmit those images off island for further support there as well
4293431 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4293432 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4293433 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4293434 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4293435 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4293436 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4293437 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4293438 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get eczema dermatitis rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing
4293439 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
4293440 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
4293441 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
4293442 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it

4293464 youve had people offer to buy your company but youve never taken the deal how come i didnt get into this for the money so im not going to get out of it for the money that was never the point for me in the dot com boom you saw people start a business with good intentions but the investors wanted bigger returns so owners began to compromise their original intentions and started mildly screwing people once that happens they have to shut down because people know they are getting screwed or the owner sells the business and becomes miserable because what started as a golden egg turned into a rotten egg to me its failure when what you set out to create becomes corrupted even if you are making a lot of money

4293647 you cant give him a yard because hes got the ability to beat the man in a one on one every time he has got exceptional speed and is a very deceptive runner
4293648 but his grandmother was a bit crook and he is very close to her and he was also a bit frustrated because kyogle were not going real well
4293649 since he came back from the tweed he has been a bit quiet but i had been asking him to do a bit more because we were struggling a bit in the halves
4293650 but he is a free flowing runner who takes his opportunities and this week i was really pleased to see him score a few tries i told him to stay wide and pick his opportunities which he did and it will give him a bit of confidence

4293663 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4293664 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4293665 the rate of redistribution of some water birds has been dramatic in recent years but for some species we still know little about the extent to which decreases in numbers in the uk are due to redistribution to other parts of their range or real decreases in overall numbers
4293666 it is vital that we learn more about the extent and consequences of redistribution in order to ensure that these species are effectively conserved
4293667 every year a network of 500 bto volunteers monitor 30 000 nests providing an enormous wealth of information about the changes in nesting activities of many of our birds
4293668 yes the gap is significantly lower this year than in years past
4293669 the gap between the american carmakers and the average import has closed to almost nothing if you look at the total corporations
4293670 but if you break it down by model there are also some categories where the u s models actually ranked ahead of the imports
4293671 these were mostly in the larger vehicle segments suvs minivans pick up trucks etc
4293672 i think what this says to consumers is that even if you buy blind without doing any research or reading any reviews and just make your choice based on styling or price you now have a much better chance of buying a higher quality vehicle or of avoiding a lower quality one
4293673 we work pretty closely with all of the manufacturers and we know that improving quality is something theyre always interested in improving
4293674 these kinds of quality improvements once consumers know about them can definitely contribute to their ability to recover
4293675 we see the effort that ford and the other automakers are putting into quality and they share our view that having a quality product is the price of entry into the market
4293676 you need to have quality vehicles in order to compete the u s carmakers are looking at quality as one of their main foundations in their turnaround plans which is good because without a quality product a companys reputation suffers which in turn means the company suffers financially
4293677 malibu was a good example of the americans closing the gap this year
4293678 that segment with the malibu camry fusion and accord is very very competitive
4293679 this shift in sales preferences among new vehicle buyers is in part a response to rapidly increasing fuel prices
4293680 the good news for consumers in this difficult environment is that they can downsize with confidence as there are many models with high initial quality in the smaller vehicle segments
4293681 and it will be particularly important for manufacturers to ensure high initial quality in these launches
4293682 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4293683 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4293684 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4293685 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4293686 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4293687 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4293688 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4293689 it was then that he first told me he could not guarantee that the buyer was going to be able to stay in the business
4293690 i have continued my relationships with my suppliers and have provided the goods that other clients have ordered from me
4293691 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4293692 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
4293693 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
4293694 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4293695 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4293696 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4293697 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4293698 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4293699 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4293700 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand

4293708 this is the first time where weve seen israeli society in general being so open to consider who yeshua is
4293709 this is a real miracle and theres beginning to be grace and favor with us in the land
4293710 i believe with all my heart after we have come back to the land we are seeing the lord the holy spirit is removing the veil from the eyes of the jews and more and more jews are realizing
4293711 when jesus came when yeshua came he came to talk to our people
4293712 he walked on our land he spoke our language he spoke in our synagogues really he came for us
4293713 our kids go with everybody else to school i go to work outside our principle is to go out and be part of society
4293714 my friends started to know im a believer and they ask me if im a believer i tell them im a believer in yeshua and its really good to believe in him and that maybe you can one day believe in him too
4293715 my point is to share my faith with anyone who wants to hear me and i will gladly share the good news of my faith

4293718 we see salvations here and there but we feel like theres something yet to come its definitely growing
4293719 i think probably the greatest challenge is that you always feel that the rest of society isnt accepting you and so when you meet somebody and you want to talk to them and you want to tell them who you are theres always that challenge of should i say something
4293720 at least we see that believers are being asked to explain who they are what they believe in why they are here how they can be israeli and believe in jesus and be given an opportunity to tell their story and share their testimony

4293765 i am proud of my many colleagues who took a stand in the last few days against running an endorsement that would have ignored the vote of the majority on our editorial board the most courageous were the board members themselves who stood up even though they could have lost their jobs unlike columnists reporters and the rest of the newspaper they do not belong to the newspaper guild they could have been fired on the spot but they chose to speak up there was no cowardice there
4293766 when dewine votes against his party he leaves it to move to the center when brown does so he moves to the democrats left
4293767 how can you write an editorial about cafta without even mentioning another supposed free trade deal called nafta has that deal benefited american workers and their families no do you think the mexican people have prospered from nafta no only the large multinational corporations who care little about the lives they ruin or disrupt have profited from nafta and how do you dare to endorse cafta without telling people that millions of people throughout central america have protested the trade deal called tlc in spanish speaking countries because they know it will only lead to more ruin just as happened in mexico
4293768 a growing bipartisan coalition against this awful trade deal which would effectively create another
4293769 alckmin herda uma prefeitura organizada onde o psdb teve um papel predominante
4293770 normal dizer isso mesmo que o prefeito atual seja de outro partido e compita com alckmin
4293771 estrategicamente aquilo me parecia conveniente mas n o houve condi es de formalizar essa alian a obviamente fico com meu partido

4293776 this is not what the wife is going to want to hear
4293777 this is non negotiable i want this to air in prime time
4293778 true but no one watches things like this in prime time there is no way that we can get viewers to watch a socially relevant program in prime time
4293779 just watch anyway those are my terms take it or leave it
4293780 this instrument can teach it can illuminate and yes it can even inspire but it can only do so to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends otherwise it is merely lights and wires in a box
4293781 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4293782 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4293783 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4293784 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4293785 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4293786 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected
4293787 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi

4293790 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip
4293791 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4293792 ultimately al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4293793 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4293794 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
4293795 if such dismissive terms are the vernacular of the golden age of diplomacy senator kerry promises
4293796 we are left to wonder which nations would care to join any future coalition
4293797 what might have happened if we had only listened to our friends
4293798 our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power we have guided missiles and misguided men
4293799 our lives begin to end the moment we become silent about things that matter
4293800 theres no way for the consumer to know whether theyre getting cloned meat or their offspring
4293801 anything thats changed the structure of the cell is a new animal drug cloning changes that structure we filed a petition but the fda said they were using their discretion that all they needed to do was some sort of risk assessment
4293802 the whole idea to take the prize bull and say that we have the best genetics that freezes the genetics with traditional breeding youre trying to improve the genetics cloning freezes it at one moment
4293803 further care needs to be taken not to rely excessively on a few apparently superior sires so as not to reduce the genetic diversity of the resulting herds
4293804 the way i live now is like i lived back in the jungle
4293805 thirty years later look at me this is where i live at
4293806 have you ever killed a man do you know what that can do to you in your darkest hours

4293808 gt vioxx and as reprehensible as giving non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids to an expectant mother without informing her that these painkillers can cause miscarriages
4293809 how can we say we live in a free country when we cant even tell the truth about nutritional supplements
4293810 denying those who sell dietary supplements from reprinting or distributing united states government publications or accurate quotations from those publications that explain the effect of nutrients on disease
4293811 distrust of the media when reporting on matters of health
4293812 i have always campaigned against the fda getting involved in food supplements
4293813 most of the costs of food supplements will go up
4293814 i have very rarely seen the government do anything that was effective
4293815 what were talking about here is millions of american consumers against fda and big government big bureaucracy
4293816 the fda had to be dragged kicking and screaming into giving license to folic acid
4293817 this vitamin which is known to be safe and effective was blocked for over a decade by the fda
4293818 we dont assume that the american people can make rational decisions
4293819 we over regulate in our society the american people this growing grassroots movement want the freedom to choose of course we want the highest standards we want quality but we should provide the information and let the consumer make the decision
4293820 100 of the contributions will be applied to purchase more media around the country
4293821 and why is it that you are all unwilling to get married
4293822 men wont marry a powerful woman with a great career especially if they make less money than a woman
4293823 is it that men are afraid of powerful women or is it that we live in this me centered universe devoid of loyalty and unconditional love could it be that we live in an age where few have the patience the tolerance or capacity to forgive like children forgive their parents on a weekly basis and that we are living our lives as if life is always greener on the other side of the mountain
4293824 i will stand beside you always even when you are broken
4293825 the american medical association is fast degenerating into a political machine bent on throttling everything which stands in its way for obtaining medical supremacy they propose to own and control every medical college in this country all the state municipal and university hospitals and licensing boards in the united states
4293826 in those days there were over 500 members of the organization back in the early 50s
4293827 and today im sorry to say over 500 members at the time were down to four four licensed naturopathic physicians in the state of florida
4293828 the ama in its so called wisdom decided after the flexner report in 1910 that it was time to eliminate all competition
4293829 by the 1950s they had almost eliminated all of the reform schools homeopathy eclectic medicine etc and then they started focusing on naturopathy naturopathy presented the greatest threat
4293830 their full support to the continuing vigorous attack on medical quackery and to the education program on the cult of chiropractic
4293831 kevin to this day i still to this day dont know why it happened
4293832 naturopathy was using all sorts of therapeutics for all possible maladies for all illnesses and infirmities that were imaginable
4293833 they were truly a competitor in the health care field
4293834 anything that is true will always remain true no matter how much you suppress it
4293835 it will resurface and it has re emerged the outcry for the therapeutic the options that naturopathic medicine has to offer is greater today than it ever has been
4293836 let your food be your medicine and let your medicine be your food
4293837 the whole usa is behind us and they are our greatest fans

4293840 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture

4293844 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4293845 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4293846 we encourage people to use the rss and e mail subscription feature so they can follow government proceedings much more closing
4293847 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
4293848 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
4293849 that would result in an annual reduction of stroke coronary heart disease and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
4293850 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
4293851 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling
4293852 much more needs to be done to ensure that patients with high blood pressure receive appropriate counseling on lifestyle change including counseling on the importance of regular aerobic exercise from their physicians
4293853 during the islamic holiday seasons such as ramadan the parking and traffic situation has been getting pretty serious
4293854 they attempted to use local businesses when they moved in
4293855 there are wires hanging from the place and no work has been done on it for a while
4293856 they just want to use the location for morning and evening worship and perhaps on weekends for activities for the children
4293857 who will lead us in the fight for health freedom
4293858 you made the calls you passed out the literature you wrote the letters you created a your own kind of pre internet blogs and passed the word across the nation
4293859 codex is no threat to us here in the usa
4293860 is it me or is it this plan that owes this money and needs to pay this bill
4293861 i aim to change the world one act of random kindness at a time
4293862 i aim to serve my country and all its people in all i do
4293863 i aim to champion freedom of speech in britain and abroad
4293864 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4293865 russia should never have fired cluster munitions against a town in georgia and now it should help in the clean up to avoid any more deaths
4293866 georgias tragedy is a warning for taiwan georgia sees a russia which wants to regain its past power taiwan sees a china which has already risen
4293867 every now and then thug leaders pick out a weakling and knock his head against the wall to remind others who is in charge
4293868 this time georgia was hit so hard that it suffered a concussion the whole world saw this to russian prime minister vladimir putin this is a small but smart war he paid a small price but achieved great results
4293869 russias lightening military move has not only crushed georgias backbone but also shaken neighboring countries like crimea ukraine poland the czech republic and the three baltic states
4293870 mikhail saakashvili the young hothead sitting in the presidents chair in the georgian capital tbilisi
4293871 why are drugs prescribed to children who had no underlying manifestation of illness
4293872 is adhd real and if so what are our medical options
4293873 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4293874 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4293875 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4293876 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4293877 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4293878 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4293879 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4293880 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4293881 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4293882 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4293883 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4293884 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4293885 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4293886 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4293887 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4293888 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this
4293889 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4293890 i am not making any judgment about the veracity of the allegations against him but his decision is clearly the most proper response to these circumstances
4293891 i can indicate my position has changed on monday i will be taking to cabinet a submission to the joint select committee on ethical conduct containing a proposed government position on these matters
4293892 i want all members of the department of police and emergency management to be the first to know that there has been ongoing investigations over a period of time into a number of allegations
4293893 one of those allegations has centred around me i have agreed to stand aside as the commissioner of police until the conclusion of the investigation and the determination of the extent of the evidence by the director of public prosecutions
4293894 may have been committed involving the disclosure of official secrets
4293895 once the investigation is completed a file will be handed to the dpp for his consideration
4293896 this is now a matter for the police and the states legal system and for that reason i cannot comment any further on the specifics of this investigation
4293897 the premier should rule out that this matter has anything to do with police investigations into various governance scandals that have rocked the labor government in recent years
4293898 this includes an ongoing investigating into allegations of corruption and issues related to shreddergate
4293899 she made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo

4293903 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4293904 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4293905 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4293906 the rowers are in for quite a few chances of winning but when racing comes at the olympics it really is difficult to consistently come up with your good results
4293907 the olympics put a lot of pressure on you and people have got to be aware of that
4293908 im just hoping they do all strike it lucky and get the first couple of races underway and get a good roll on it then if the first couple start winning you never know what happens
4293909 i got the first one underway and once that happened i knew there was nothing going to stop me i knew i was the best and the whole team sort of got in that same vibe and we just suddenly felt invincible
4293910 whether it sways votes or not privacy and security are two critical issues we face
4293911 the government sees cybersecurity as a national security issue and an infrastructure issue and i think its tremendously important not only from a military perspective but also from keeping people safe from crime
4293912 i think were seeing pretty much any military engagement will have some sort of cyber components
4293913 any president who wants to emphasize military credentials ought to be concerned with protecting this critical infrastructure
4293914 there needs to be a critical look at the evidence and see where self regulation is working and where its not and where its not there is room for appropriate privacy regulations
4293915 i hate rude behavior in a man i wont tolerate it
4293916 attaction is not only about making people look but having some depth once they do take a peek dont be the amy winehouse of your space look inward and figure out whether you have something to offer once someone looks
4293917 so we got the recession that is expected and the reserve bank continues to ease interest rates
4293918 whats the point weve done this hike once in the fog why do it twice
4293919 why dont we sit down for a few minutes and see what happens
4293920 talking to the party gottlieb hadnt been feeling that well and they came back to the hut yesterday and probably sounds like within about 30 minutes of arriving at the hut he collapsed
4293921 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours theyre a party of four or five and they did a huge job as a team of trying to bring him back around
4293922 after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4293923 shes a remarkable woman very collected upset to have lost a friend like gottleib but yeah a remarkable woman
4293924 talking to the party gottlieb hadnt been feeling that well and they came back to the hut yesterday and probably sounds like within about 30 minutes of arriving at the hut he collapsed
4293925 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours theyre a party of four or five and they did a huge job as a team of trying to bring him back around

4293928 you know and unfortunately blogging has had to take a second seat lately hopefully this wont be the case for too much longer
4293929 one of my favourite tracks off the new album and one that i highlighted back in this past post
4293930 and it was particularly during this track that it him me again as it always does when i watch jason live
4293931 and it was simply beautiful melanie then was called back on stage for jason and her to perform
4293932 dont let your mind stop you from having fun you know you might have been at home trying to figure out what to wear tonight if youre a girl you might have tried on five pairs of shoes and you come here thinking youre going to tear it up but as soon as you walk in suddenly you think be cool dont dont let your mind tell you what to do just have fun in the now dont worry about what other people think besides its dark you dont even know these other people so i want to see those hands in the air
4293933 and then finally ended off the set with the cracking tune
4293934 this could perhaps have been my favourite performance of the night which is strange as its by far my favourite tune from jasons albums
4293935 over last month weve been able to buy gas at lower prices and put it into storage but earlier in the summer and spring we were buying gas back then as well
4293936 we threw everything we could at trying to help him trying to get support in but unfortunately with weather like that you just cant get a helicopter in
4293937 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere
4293938 you wouldnt believe that this is a spot where a person was almost killed
4293939 the fire was so bad people werent even left with a handkerchief

4293941 this fix will stop the flood this time we mean it
4293942 este plantel se est conformando gracias al apoyo de dos importantes empresas privadas
4293943 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4293944 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4293945 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover
4293946 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4293947 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down

4293950 we wish the best for everyone participating in the election
4293951 if the public wants to speak with a candidate after the forum they will have an opportunity individually
4293952 i was waiting for an opportunity and my girlfriend at the time was waiting tables at the switchboard deli on madison
4293953 im nocturnal so having those late hours wasnt strange for me
4293954 when we moved into our own space we kept the hours we had on madison because our customers liked them and i didnt want to compete with otherlands and java cabana
4293955 the building on cooper had six parking spots and i had an agreement with my neighbors to use some of their parking spaces but it still wasnt enough
4293956 so we moved to the location on poplar and also changed our hours to be open 24 hours a day
4293957 but i had a lot of stuff going on in my life and i just had to after i put that sticky note on the door i left town for a few days and when i came back there were hundreds of notes on the door from customers who couldnt believe that we were closed who wished me well and who said theyd be here when the edge returned
4293958 we picked an average night and keith walked around the coffee shop asking everybody the same question why do you come to the edge

4293978 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4293979 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4293980 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4293981 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4293982 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4293983 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4293984 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4293985 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4293986 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4293987 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4293988 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4293989 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4293990 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4293991 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4293992 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4293993 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4294001 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4294049 i very much appreciate your depth of knowledge in the mortgage industry i originally heard you on your radio show being a natural skeptic i listened several times to your show and i read your book i then researched the yield spread premium amounts on my previous property acquisitions and refinances a total of eleven of them and since i didnt go through a bank thank goodness every single one of them showed an ysp amount

4294054 i cant speak highly enough of liverpool a great club with a great manager and a great history
4294055 they will be a real handful playing together i think liverpool will go close and im sure theyd like to think theyd go closer than the last few years
4294056 thats why theyve bought robbie thats why theyre trying to bring players like gareth barry to their club really good players who know the premiership inside out
4294057 but its chelsea for me this year i always felt that manchester united would do it last season but i fancy chelsea this time because theres no african nations cup and they have a new manager who has bought one or two new players if united get a top top striker then they have a chance but my gut feeling this year would be chelsea

4294103 i would not have rev jeremiah wright for my pastor
4294104 you get to choose your pastor you dont choose your family but you get to choose your pastor
4294105 do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses
4294106 obey your leaders and submit to their authority they keep watch over you as men who must give an account obey them so that their work will be a joy not a burden for that would be of no advantage to you
4294107 to pray is to change prayer is the central avenue god uses to transform us to ask rightly involves transformed passions in prayer real prayer we begin to think gods thoughts after him to desire the things he desires to love the things he loves to will the things he wills
4294108 and when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others
4294109 this then is how you should pray our father in heaven hallowed by your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven

4294123 faith begins to read the bible and the eyes of the heart are opened to see god and to see christ portrayed so that the self authenticating power of the word draws you to close with it and causes you to believe that paul is inspired and that jesus is who he says he is
4294124 my experience is that if i have the time i can generally come to some resolution or some plausible conviction about the passage
4294125 i may not have the solution here but i believe there is a solution and someday ill see it
4294126 if the biblical record can be proved fallible in areas of fact that can be verified then it is hardly to be trusted in areas where it cannot be tested
4294127 it is a matter of basic self contradiction for someone to hold that in matters of history and science the bible may err and yet for him to expound any text from the scripture as having authority in his own right
4294128 whenever historical accounts of the bible are called in question on the basis of alleged disagreement with the findings of archaeology or the testimony of ancient non hebrew documents always remember that the bible is itself an archaeological document of the highest caliber
4294129 the dead sea scrolls have shown that there is on the whole an amazing degree of continuity in the way the text has been copied over thousands of years
4294130 saying that there are real problems with the text but you are willing to gloss over that because you like the overall message
4294131 clearly liking something does not make it true as much as i might like to convince myself that every time i ring a bell 5 cents are added to my bank account i will find that it is not actually the case
4294132 ultimately though it is up to the researcher to decide what conclusions the current data points toward while at the same time acknowledging that new data may become available in the future which might challenge his or her conclusion
4294133 to show how the bible cannot address the issue of suffering the very issue that convinced him to abandon his christian beliefs
4294134 the possibility of hell continues to trouble him and that there are still nights where he wakes up in a cold sweat he misses being able to offer thanks for all the good things in his life
4294135 if wachovia decides it needs more capital that would be one of the first places it could look
4294136 the riaa eventually dropped it with prejudice meaning they accept the fault was theirs in this case
4294137 i havent bought an riaa cd in over six years what about you guys helping them on their way to the grave
4294138 a dismissal with prejudice means the plaintiff may not turn around and re file
4294139 makes the grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate
4294140 only if the heavens can be measured will i reject the descendants of israel
4294141 for god who said let light shine out of darkness made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of god
4294142 let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons for days and years and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth
4294143 but if you or i went as non native americans consumers thetax on the product would have already been paid on the wholesalelevel and they would not be entitled to a refund of that tax underthis bill because you and i are not tribal members
4294144 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4294145 faith is a belief that is contrary to the sum of the evidence for that belief
4294146 the fundamental fact of existence is that this trust in god this faith is the firm foundation under everything that makes life worth living its our handle on what we cant see
4294147 what one believes about the world for an overarching structure that enables people to see the connections of its parts and where its all heading
4294148 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
4294149 now faith is being 100 certain of what we hope is true and absolutely sure about what we have no evidence for
4294150 do i really want to be counted among those who have faith
4294151 a belief that is contrary to the sum of the evidence for that belief
4294152 a worldview is a commitment a fundamental orientation of the heart that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions assumptions which may be true partially true or entirely false which we hold consciously or subconsciously consistently or inconsistently about the basic constitution of reality and that provides the foundation on which we live and have our being
4294153 i dont feel the need to prove my faith or prove god exists i look at all of the evidence and believing in god is what makes the most sense to me logically
4294154 dan zal ik over de poging om mij te verleiden

4294156 if we read the text as a mystic might paying extremely close attention assuming that the text conceals more than it reveals we may find hints regarding gods androgynous nature so to speak peeking out through the surface level of the torah
4294157 if moses name spelled backward becomes the name hashem gods name might not gods name spelled backward similarly reflect something essential about humankind indeed it does
4294158 in truth and error all we really know is that this name has become the precious name
4294159 its so precious we choose not to pronounce it it represents a deity who is beyond definition
4294160 the albums titled metamorphosis and the album is just that
4294161 theres some stuff thats like harder and faster on this record that we you know have kind of delved away from for a little while but then also theres like a polarity to that its like for us it was just you know just kicking down new doors thats what we do all the time with our music its definitely a diverse record and some of the most powerful music weve written
4294162 fell apart when tommy left he was the glue of the ramones
4294163 used to walk around without a shirt on in the middle of the night carrying a baseball bat he was a scary guy you didnt want to be on his bad list
4294164 who was the first nfl player to appear on the cover of a madden football game
4294165 madden 2000 had barry sanders on the cover the answer is barry sanders
4294166 im sorry it was eddie george please take your seat
4294167 i write these questions myself i did the research its eddie george
4294168 look im not giving you the points go sit down
4294169 it wont matter hes not my manager so just go sit down
4294170 fine how about i give you your points and we just leave it at that
4294171 barry sanders was the first player to be on a madden cover you just agreed with me i want my points and i want the other teams to have points deducted for being wrong
4294172 i just want to ask you all something i just proved to this man that barry sanders was on the cover of madden 2000 a year before eddie george appeared on the cover in 2001 hes acknowledged that im right and offered to give me my points now my question is if im right then should the other two teams get points even though they were wrong
4294173 folks i need to make a correction i believe i read the question wrong
4294174 who was the first nfl player to have his portrait on the cover of a madden game
4294175 the picture that the gentleman you just heard from showed me has barry sanders in the background so were not going to be able to accept his answer as correct
4294176 if youd read it that way in the first place i could have answered it differently
4294177 but you didnt you just asked who was on the cover first
4294178 well give you your next round of drinks on the house just let this one go
4294179 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4294180 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4294181 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4294182 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4294183 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4294184 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4294185 where will i find the time in the day to do this
4294186 was the guy black or white why did they move him
4294187 what do yuou think and they had to move him there were cameras all over the place they just ran him over and had to show that he was ok you know one of them had to know that there were news cameras above them
4294188 well you know that the on board camera wont be working
4294189 yeah and the dog pissed on the camera yeah thats the ticket
4294190 no it was the fuse that burned out the officer was trying to put out the flames from the fuses with his foot which is why he ran the guy over
4294191 it the course starts from the highest wooden platform in the country onto a super fast start straight which will see riders flying towards the big quad jump before slamming on the brakes and hitting the berm at the end of the longest straight this year a few corners and hip jump later and riders will be crossing the line to be crowned 2008 series champions
4294192 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalog
4294193 its more money and i think it will bring more qualified teachers into the system and get rid of some teachers who arent
4294194 this is not pay tied to performance this is basically a scheme to eliminate teachers rights
4294195 the only certainties in life are death taxes and newborn poo when out amp about
4294196 gianna has been one of my favorites since the first time i saw her her scene in this movie is one of the longer ones and its nice to see that shes grown out a nice thick bush for this scene
4294197 and as a boob movie should probably have all the cumshots land on the girls chests
4294198 exotic looking darkhaired alanna ackerman has huge natural tits and great skill with a hard dick and the tremendous rack of california blonde riley evans is a work of art gorgeous brunette evie delatosso uses an ice cube on her nipples and fan favorite velicity von treats us to a sexy striptease getting down to spitting wet oral before taking a load on her tits violet adamson is another blonde newcummer who sucks a mans balls until he shoots his wad onto her giant pair of boobs
4294199 we want to give back to you our fans and friends so we got the owner to make this a free party for everyone
4294200 attire is as casual sexy wild or as wacky as you want to be just be there
4294201 the move by nst to encourage teachers involvement in workshops like this also helps them to develop their teaching skills
4294202 i hope that there will be greater participation from schools in the outskirts of kuala lumpur like sungai penchala and kampung batu and also from smart schools
4294203 currently my school has 50 computers for use by more than 1 000 students
4294204 even though it is a highly beneficial programme there is limited access to computers and students in rural areas often do not have access to the internet
4294205 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play
4294206 i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires
4294207 our experiences in handling major activities during the nipah virus outbreak and engaging in many non military operations and exercises have allowed us to develop our own strategies in confronting any outbreak of diseases
4294208 even vietnam and cambodia have made extraordinary efforts to prepare and combat such an outbreak
4294209 we want the human resources minister to investigate the arrest of the foreign worker as we suspect that the company he worked for could have used its influence to get the immigration officer to stop him from attending court
4294210 you made the police report and the court must hear your testimony if you are subpoenaed you must be in court if you dont come i will have to throw out the case this is the final adjournment in this case
4294211 then after you get married we will see if the prosecution still wants to go ahead with the case
4294212 the assistant public prosecutor should check if she still wants to press charges against her future husband
4294213 all it had to do was to wait for the third agreement to lapse and then refuse a renewal
4294214 im looking forward to probably a 1 2 3 us finish
4294215 i dont think the final is going to be as intense as what we experienced
4294216 my goal is to medal in beijing and bring home the hardware
4294217 i know i should medal if i dont i will be disappointed in myself its within reach in both events
4294218 this year i really learned how to plan out my races well
4294219 i dont feel pressure i feel like i should be here no one can count me out anymore
4294220 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
4294221 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
4294222 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
4294223 yes chong wei has been impressive and that is good however we are not there yet and we must prepare for any eventuality
4294224 hyun il will be a tough opponent and nothing much separates them what chong wei has going for him is his stability he has been like a rock thus far and if he can maintain this he has a very good chance
4294225 that was the reason for my slow start against sony it played on my mind the last malaysian still in and i struggled a bit
4294226 i know hyun il very well and i am not thinking of the final just yet i have to focus on the semi final first
4294227 my nerves settled when i reached the break in the lead 11 8 i then began to follow the game plan which was to draw him to the net and it worked
4294228 except for a few divers our degree of difficulty is the same with most and what will be the difference here is mistakes
4294229 if mun yee and elizabeth dive as well as they normally do then they should make the semi finals
4294230 i would say beating the number one player in the world has got to be up there
4294231 i wasnt thinking about winning two gold medals at the two consecutive olympic games
4294232 what i wanted to do is show my best performance here in beijing
4294233 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4294234 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4294235 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
4294236 my coach said to me that we will have two swimmers from china in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4294237 we came to an idea to do something special that will be only ours
4294238 and we agreed because we are a team we fight for each other and we die for each other and we wanted to do something not so usual among other teams
4294239 we are looking forward to our battle with cameroon we are in the knock out stages where each game is a matter of survival
4294240 we respect cameroon and we are going to be prepared and try to play better than in the last game
4294241 this is an important game for brazil but it is not a day of destiny for ronaldinho
4294242 it is important because we have a dream of winning gold medals so we need to get past cameroon
4294243 we must put the benefit of the team first i cant keep all my famous players on the pitch all the time
4294244 we must take it seriously they have good players and a strong team
4294245 i am so proud to be part of this team i hope we can win another olympic gold
4294246 a lot of teams think they can beat us but you cant go over how fast we are until you get out there on the court with us it was a great game for us
4294247 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4294248 i have won honour for all archers in china and i believe the future will be brighter
4294249 i dreamed i could win a gold medal every day i was well prepared it was a hard journey but i finally made it the solidarity and the trust within the team led to my success i really did believe i could win
4294250 i shot the last arrow with no hesitation because i was confident
4294251 i think silver is just as good as gold however it would be a lie to say there are no regrets
4294252 the silver makes me crave gold more next time so its a good experience
4294253 third place falls short of my expectations but i will work hard for the 2012 olympics and at that time i will probably be able to win more than a bronze
4294254 i have never imagined that i could win the gold in the olympic games
4294255 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4294256 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
4294257 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
4294258 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
4294259 it was unfortunate that the headgear broke but i wasnt thinking about it i was thinking about the fight
4294260 the fortune teller told me if you change your name you will win the gold
4294261 some people believe in fortune tellers and i am one of them so i followed her advice
4294262 i will not hide yes i have failed and i leave it to the bam to decide i expected much more from the pairs but i have to concede that we were not as good as i thought we were
4294263 i was shocked at the way they played against markis hendra as it was in direct contrast to their performance against the japanese
4294264 i want to look at what went wrong and i am not speaking from the technical point of view if there is something wrong with them in terms of mental strength then we must find out
4294265 preparation wise they were perfect and so was their relationship that is not what caused the defeat
4294266 that is a possibility as for the moment we only have zakry latiff fairuzizuan tazari who can be considered a solid pair kien keat boon heong are not what they were and we will see what is the next step but splitting them is a possibility i have entertained
4294267 i dont think there is nothing much we can talk about tan fook wan wah anymore as their result here is enough for us to decide i will make my recommendation to bam
4294268 as a pair they have reached their limit and i think moving to the mixed doubles is something they should give serious thought to especially as they will not be able to challenge the top women pairs
4294269 its crucial that i spend the coming season without any injury
4294270 many chances will come along during the coming year whats important is how i grab those chances
4294271 you can see the quality hes got on the ball and hes still adapting to the pace of english football he has a great attitude and is working hard in pre season training
4294272 no less than the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1978 the events of the past several days are a bell ringer for defense stocks
4294273 we strongly urge purchase of aerospace defense issues a sector which has declined with the broad market since the start of the year
4294274 this conflict is likely to be brief and fit into a general pattern of tensions within the former borders of the soviet union
4294275 this fight is about 70 000 people who feel more affinity to russia than they do for the breakaway state
4294276 its not the sort of fight that raises major issue for the u s and its not in a strategic location to warrant our deeper involvement
4294277 does the environment created in a class excite the participants enough to want to ask others to share in the experience
4294278 groups of people who feel good about what they are experiencing and the environment in which they are experiencing it will more likely to invite others to experience it with them
4294279 sadly a lot people faithfully attend churches they would never invite someone else to attend
4294280 i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
4294281 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president barack obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation
4294282 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4294283 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4294284 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4294285 we need politicians with the guts to say that but i dont see that
4294286 say the right words and set goals to reduce emissions but their actions prove they dont mean it
4294287 the really crucial thing here is that one of the worlds leading scientists is drawing attention to the need for strong bold action
4294288 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
4294289 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
4294290 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online
4294291 pumping the video quality up to olympic levels is a hurdle nbc can and surely will work to overcome in time for the next olympics two years from now
4294292 global consciousness influenced by holistic philosophies green politics and a willingness to explore the mind body and spirit
4294293 soooo are you as concerned about toxic sex toys as i am
4294294 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4294295 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4294296 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4294297 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4294298 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4294299 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4294300 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans
4294301 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4294302 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4294303 the topaz solar farm will grow clean electricity on previously disturbed unused farmland with low profile panels minimizing visual impact
4294304 its designed to be compatible with key wildlife species and avoid environmentally sensitive areas
4294305 we are now here with technology available now that will allow solar to take its place among central station power plants with wind geothermal gas and coal
4294306 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4294307 thats really good news because the department of energy predicts we will need 386 gigawatts by 2015 just to keep up with load growth this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future
4294308 you know what i dont want to rent to you
4294309 cut his penis off the unusual application caused laughter in the courtroom
4294310 written off many northern cities as worthless failures and advised their inhabitants to move south at once
4294311 last year i wasnt working because my kids were little but this year i had to go back to work to make ends meet with my husband its kind of hard for him you cant have just one parent working at this time
4294312 competition is always going to be stiff but i think in this economy its even more so so the more specials the more deals the more incentives that our merchants have the better it is actually
4294313 yeah youve got to watch out for your gas too you cant drive too far because youre spending that money on gas instead of on clothes for the kids so youve got to know where youre going and know what you want
4294314 you rag on me for watching my movies and youre going to watch some shit called frankenfish
4294315 it was crucial that we get an actor who was sexy and believable as an action hero
4294316 angelina jolie has real credibility she is that woman shes not just a pretty female pretending to wield a gun
4294317 rather than going for big backends and a list producers
4294318 at new line we didnt have the luxury of long term development either you just got it right on the first or second round or it didnt happen
4294319 i look at a situation see the big picture prioritize and do what i think best
4294320 communicating with everybody in a timely fashion like good job on the script great screening last night good opening last weekend outreach is a big part of the job
4294321 the biggest shift of emphasis is not looking at anything in purely domestic terms
4294322 we look at our film slates on a global level
4294323 its a different movie than if we had shot it with brad
4294324 russell gives a wonderful naturalistic performance in terms of what we set out to achieve its a dramatic thriller with a romantic triangle at the center thats intact
4294325 by sharing knowledge of online games as entertainment media we hope to inspire the next generation game companies to think differently and grow the overall market worldwide
4294326 i would like to clarify that we are honored that he will continue as our full partner in control of ua
4294327 just as the hot glorious months begin to seem like they could stretch on forever those three blunt sounds bring it all crashing to a close
4294328 we saw this transaction and its terms as an attractive opportunity to further simplify our structure and to better position us to create future growth
4294329 various types of games for the nintendo systems are represented in the top 10 demonstrating how we continue to break down the barriers between veteran and new players
4294330 the drugs depicted are fictional drugs are depicted as stylised icons on a menu with the drug use itself not depicted
4294331 who who is this i have no idea who this is
4294332 remember me we went to a broadway play awhile ago
4294333 poor me why cant we be just friends you know like for seeing plays and musicals
4294334 im on deadline in fact i thought you were my editor calling because i am late with my story
4294335 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalog
4294336 vi m ste ju f rst ra till f rm n f r andra eftersom det r v r plikt
4294337 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again
4294338 theres already an awful lot of in this convention and charlie would have been a bit too much
4294339 the release date for the sixth harry potter movie harry potter and the half blood prince was pushed back on thursday to july 2009 from its original slot in november 2008
4294340 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4294341 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4294342 it should be reconstructed to remember those times and show bosnians and the world how we lived how we survived
4294343 if the city rebuilds it it would become the premier tourist destination in the city
4294344 nah bofs long gone lets make a new game breath of pixies
4294345 ohoho as a brilliant scheme lets put random words that mean nothing into the question oh and add random numbers that make no sense
4294346 hi edexcel emailed us with some improvements for you to do
4294347 the force is strong with you luke you dont happen to have any skittles by chance theyre the only thing that fits through my visor
4294348 a ti te pasa esto y yo que tu haria aquello
4294349 through the search warrant weve been able to obtain some information that may lead us to the completion of this case
4294350 no est claro por qu las temperaturas se elevan tan r pido y una teor a es que los suelos menos fr os se desecan totalmente reduciendo la cantidad de calor que puede absorber del sol

4294400 eu sou um dos casos que o post toca e vim ent o aqui contar um pouco da minha hist ria
4294401 th tha that that that dont kill me can only make me stronga
4294402 attached you will find a copy of the contract as it stands without full board approval and it is important to note that we have reviewed comparable districts that have recently hired superintendents in the state i believe we are in line with someone of dr shaws experience an expertise
4294403 i want to thank those who participated in the small group interviews as well as the community forum for their feedback as well as the community for their support as we searched for a superintendent i believe this is a positive step for racine unified and our community
4294404 i believe my mother caylees great grandmother also heard caylee during that time
4294405 geez i wish i wasnt losing my house right now so if im making a profit somehow its not doing me a lot of good
4294406 any bigfeets that volunteer to serve in iraq will earn a path to citizenship along with the gratefultude of the american populace
4294407 for several hundred years now the white man has done great harm to the indigenerous peoples of north america
4294408 we must not repeat again those same mistakes a second time these latest native american peoples have not come into confliction with white men because they operate primatally at night while we operate openly more or less in the light of day these new indians still live in the woods whereas we dont because of pathogenetics like lyme disease now it appears one of us has even shot what the civilized indians call socksquash in order to ensure that this does not happen again i propose the creation of native american ape reservations where our fellow savage creatures may roam freely within safely contained areas and enjoy america like the rest of us do
4294409 we must not repeat the mistakes of the past in this new future
4294410 slaughtering indigenerous peoples and leaving them without any livelihoods is morally repugnacious we owe them more than that and we will pay we will not stop continuing until they are capable of supporting themselves without our help or assistance then they too can feel the pride of living in a country full of freedom and opportunistic behavior once they are trained in how to do so that is
4294411 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
4294412 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website
4294413 the harvest is more important comrade snowball will lead the way i shall follow in a few minutes
4294414 in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared
4294415 there were different times where i was close to coming back to mls
4294416 but d c that isnt home thats a four or five hour plane ride florida i might as well stay in europe
4294417 there are four pro leagues in the world that every professional player wants to play in and ive been fortunate enough to play in three of them
4294418 hopefully in 20 or 30 years mls will be on par with those its only been around for 13 years ive played for teams that started in 1885
4294419 one of the best ways to have an attacking style of play is to have offensive players who are confident in their defense and in their goalkeeper
4294420 if you believe youre going to have a shutout and not give up goals it gives you confidence to go forward and score goals
4294421 uh yeah i am crying already i have been for the past 6 years
4294422 mom that little boy is eating a goldfish off the floor and that is not the right thing to do
4294423 his idea always was to ruffle feathers and to do it in a very poetic way
4294424 it influenced a whole bunch of directors in that particular time
4294425 even if you look at a later movie like taps which starred sean penn and timothy hutton as mutinous military cadets youll see if in there
4294426 you could say that lindsay was rather cynical but maybe he was optimistic
4294427 he was a great maverick and iconoclast who always said exactly what he felt
4294428 my mother played piano my father drank beer and wed get a harmony going
4294429 the whole movement is just one progression its fantastically beautiful like how everything is getting cold when the sun is being covered
4294430 i think its a fantastic idea of peter sellars to make this juxtaposition the inside and the outside worlds in a way
4294431 apart from the orchestral sound theres always this electric sound world and the text is read with it
4294432 one of the most imaginative and brilliant uses of the movie screen and soundtrack that i have ever seen
4294433 in terms of understanding the power of sound and picture relationships
4294434 si bien las autonom as deben constitucionalizarse esta debe ser sobre la base del di logo y no en la forma que quiere llevar adelante el prefecto cruce o rub n costas con la imposici n
4294435 incluso de armonizar la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado y las autonom as
4294436 nosotros exhortamos a que se cumpla con el proceso de di logo que se agote esa instancia pero no obrar m s con medidas de hecho
4294437 el gobierno del presidente evo morales ayma reconoce las autonom as y su prop sito es constitucionalizar para asegurar al pa s aires de tranquilidad eso es lo que m s pide el pueblo
4294438 por el ejemplar comportamiento c vico y la alta participaci n de la ciudadan a en el referendo revocatorio
4294439 destacan el resultado obtenido por el gobierno boliviano y expresan su confianza en que los resultados de este ejercicio democr tico favorecer n la reanudaci n del proceso de di logo nacional
4294440 se congratulan por el clima de tranquilidad y normalidad que caracteriz el desarrollo de este leg timo acto plebiscitario
4294441 a fortalecer el proceso democr tico las instituciones y el estado de derecho en bolivia
4294442 ayer mi rcoles cerca del medio d a pasamos los dos millones de votos y yo le dec a al vicepresidente lvaro garc a linera y a algunos ministros que estaban en palacio hemos cumplido con la palabra de tupaj katari qu dijo l yo muero pero volver convertido en millones
4294443 hemos conseguido dos millones estas marchas no han sido en vano
4294444 ahora puedo afirmar que no s lo estamos el gobierno por el apoyo de los movimientos sociales sino con el apoyo de los sectores sociales intelectuales y los j venes podemos decir que tenemos el poder del pueblo
4294445 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4294446 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4294447 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4294448 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4294449 una nueva ley de pensiones debe ser solidaria el estado debe promover la seguridad social para todos los habitantes de bolivia
4294450 estas dos organizaciones prefectura y el comit c vico pro santa cruz son representantes de la derecha econ mica que busca ahora no viabilizar un posible acuerdo entre los prefectos que aceptaron el di logo con el ejecutivo
4294451 esperamos que el impuesto directo a los hidrocarburos no sea s lo una excusa est n exponiendo sus esfuerzos para discutir este tema y buscan dejar de lado el tema de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado
4294452 son propuestas que hacen a la problem tica nacional y esperemos que exista una respuesta en la dimensi n que realiz el presidente
4294453 podemos ha perdido su personalidad jur dica no tiene estructura y tampoco tiene estatutos y ante ello no hay a qu instancia renunciar
4294454 hace cuatro meses por un conflicto con la diputada podemos decidi prescindir de su participaci n es una persona que por falta de tica ha sido separada
4294455 si me retiraron o no l luis v squez no es la persona indicada para decirlo porque pr cticamente a pesar de ser senador el pueblo le ha dado su rechazo en todo el pa s es una persona que ya en pol tica est de quemada
4294456 nunca tuvo estructura podemos pese a ello he dado la cara por esta alianza yo llegu a la pol tica a trav s de un convenio con siglo xxi
4294457 hay que reconocer que el congreso nacional se ha debilitado hemos entrado en una poca de transici n pol tica nos cuesta mucho m s hacer oposici n desde el congreso que de las regiones precisamente por la falta de estructura y medios tenemos una oposici n disminuida
4294458 tuto quiroga me ha decepcionado por su falta de patriotismo y por haber demostrado que no es un gran estadista
4294459 las decisiones inconsultas est n a la cabeza de jorge quiroga luis v squez carlos b hrt y w lter guiteras podemos no se consolid como partido ha tenido frustraciones internas con gente de santa cruz para consolidar un poder pol tico regional
4294460 est roto el v nculo con podemos donde hay un malestar generalizado por las decisiones hace dos meses que no asistimos a ninguna reuni n de la agrupaci n
4294461 a lot of people talk about us and say we play good football good football is good but we didnt win anything and you play to win
4294462 what we are going to keep in our heads is that playing football is good but sometimes you have to be tough on the pitch to win a game we have learnt a lot of things sometimes you have to be dirty to win some games you need to do that because it is part of football
4294463 against twente we didnt play good football and certainly didnt play our best but we won 2 0 and thats what its all about
4294464 we kept going and kept passing it sometimes you have to forget about trying to play beautiful football and just make sure you win the game that is the important thing although we have to remember the passing and movement that we want to do
4294465 it should be reconstructed to remember those times and show bosnians and the world how we lived how we survived
4294466 if the city rebuilds it it would become the premier tourist destination in the city
4294467 even i wouldnt come here if this wasnt my house
4294468 it could be a joint venture with a foreign firm
4294469 twenty five meters is not enough for people to remember how we suffered in the war
4294470 if people think about the past we couldnt have wars
4294471 at the hospital my brother passed on and they gave me the money in his pocket and i knew he couldve paid him 3 and that boy just took his life for nothing
4294472 to make an apt answer is a joy to a man and a word in season how good it is
4294473 secret things belong to the lord but the things revealed to us belong to us forever
4294474 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart
4294475 can you drink the cup of submission yes i realize full well what many of you are thinking thats all weve ever done but i would ask of you can you now drink the cup as christ means you to drink it not because you must but because you choose to would you be willing to put aside your legitimate rights if the time to exercise them is not yet right in your particular circumstances would you be willing to put your career on hold if that is in the best interests of your family or your cultural milieu will you work for change in a patient and loving manner rather than sinking into anger and bitterness will you commit yourself to work in a christ like way even if you are in un christlike situations
4294476 and now compelled by the spirit i am going to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there i only know that in every city the holy spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me however i consider my life worth nothing to me if only i may finish the race and complete the task the lord jesus has given me the task of testifying to the gospel of gods grace
4294477 im not scared and im willing to die if only im able to continue living out the purpose set before me
4294478 the confession of evil works is the first beginning of good works
4294479 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective
4294480 confession is a difficult discipline for us because we all too often view the believing community as a fellowship of saints before we see it as a fellowship of sinners we feel that every one else as advanced so far in to holiness that we are isolated and alone in our sin we cannon bear to reveal our failures and shortcomings to others we imagine that we are the only ones who have no stepped onto the high road to heaven therefore we hide ourselves from one another and live in veiled lies and hypocrisy
4294481 we conceal our sins thinking that everyone is better than us or couldnt possibly relate to this or that
4294482 aw man i wish i had spread the jelly first because peanut butter is a lot harder to rinse off of a knife than jelly
4294483 more web sites are adopting recaptchas each day so the rate of transcription keeps growing
4294484 more than 4 million words are being transcribed every day it would take more than 1 500 people working 40 hours a week at a rate of 60 words a minute to match our weekly output
4294485 of georgia he spent nearly four hours being briefed at cia headquarters about the war on terror and the grim situation in georgia american military force in the nearly week old war despite continued uncertainty about russias next move
4294486 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4294487 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4294488 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that
4294489 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4294490 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4294491 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4294492 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4294493 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4294494 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4294495 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation
4294496 our subpar quarterback is not nearly as bad as yours
4294497 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4294498 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4294499 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4294500 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4294501 we hear you we will release jake as a full length film available on itunes for you to download and put on your iphone computer or even an appletv
4294502 i want the whole thing i dont want bite size pieces if thats the case ill just wait for it to be done and order the dvd
4294503 dan barangsiapa yang berpaling dari peringatan ku maka sesungguhnya baginya penghidupan yang sempit dan kami akan menghimpunkannya pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan buta
4294504 barangsiapa yang allah menghendaki akan memberikan kepadanya petunjuk niscaya dia melapangkan dadanya untuk memeluk agama islam dan barangsiapa yang dikehendaki allah kesesatannya niscaya allah menjadikan dadanya sesak lagi sempit seolah olah ia sedang mendaki kelangit begitulah allah menimpakan siksa kepada orang orang yang tidak beriman
4294505 maka apakah orang orang yang dibukakan allah hatinya untuk menerima agama islam lalu ia mendapat cahaya dari rabbnya sama dengan orang yang membatu hatinya maka kecelakaan yang besarlah bagi mereka yang membatu hatinya untuk mengingat allah mereka itu dalam kesesatan yang nyata
4294506 akan kami masukkan ke dalam hati orang orang kafir rasa takut disebabkan mereka mempersekutukan allah dengan sesuatu yang allah sendiri tidak menurunkan keterangan tentang itu tempat kembali mereka ialah neraka dan itulah seburuk buruk tempat tinggal orang orang yang zalim
4294507 maka apakah orang orang yang dibukakan allah hatinya untuk menerima agama islam lalu ia mendapat cahaya dari rabbnya sama dengan orang yang membatu hatinya maka kecelakaan yang besarlah bagi mereka yang membatu hatinya untuk mengingat allah mereka itu dalam kesesatan yang nyata
4294508 barangsiapa yang allah menghendaki akan memberikan kepadanya petunjuk niscaya dia melapangkan dadanya untuk memeluk agama islam dan barangsiapa yang dikehendaki allah kesesatannya niscaya allah menjadikan dadanya sesak lagi sempit seolah olah ia sedang mendaki kelangit begitulah allah menimpakan siksa kepada orang orang yang tidak beriman
4294509 dan dia telah mengajarkan kepadamu apa yang belum kamu ketahui
4294510 maka ketahuilah bahwa tidak ada ilah yang haq melainkan allah
4294511 dan bahwasanya jikalau mereka tetap berjalan lurus di atas jalan itu agama islam benar benar kami akan memberi minum kepada mereka air yang segar rezki yang banyak
4294512 dan orang orang yang menjauhkan diri dari perbuatan dan perkataan yang tiada berguna
4294513 tiada suatu ucapanpun yang diucapkan melainkan ada di dekatnya malaikat pengawas yang selalu hadir
4294514 hai anak adam pakailah pakaianmu yang indah di setiap memasuki masjid makan dan minumlah dan jangan berlebih lebihan sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berlebih lebihan
4294515 come up with a plan on how to murder someone
4294516 whether it sways votes or not privacy and security are two critical issues we face
4294517 the government sees cybersecurity as a national security issue and an infrastructure issue and i think its tremendously important not only from a military perspective but also from keeping people safe from crime
4294518 i think were seeing pretty much any military engagement will have some sort of cyber components
4294519 any president who wants to emphasize military credentials ought to be concerned with protecting this critical infrastructure
4294520 there needs to be a critical look at the evidence and see where self regulation is working and where its not and where its not there is room for appropriate privacy regulations
4294521 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4294522 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4294523 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4294524 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4294525 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4294526 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4294527 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4294528 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4294529 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4294530 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4294531 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4294532 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4294533 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4294534 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4294535 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4294536 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4294537 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4294538 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4294539 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4294540 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4294541 for beginners who know nothing technical what is the easiest way to make money or make a living off the internet
4294542 if you can believe you can do it you are right if you believe you can not do it your right too
4294543 sorry it just isnt in the budget this year but we really appreciate your efforts
4294544 hey we really appreciated the work you have done on this project and so we got you this franklin
4294545 yeah man i feel you i am exactly the same way i hate my job
4294546 we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit
4294547 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013
4294548 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4294549 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4294550 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4294551 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4294552 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4294553 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4294554 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4294555 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4294556 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4294557 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4294558 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4294559 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4294560 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4294561 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4294562 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4294563 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4294564 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4294565 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4294566 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4294567 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4294568 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4294569 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4294570 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4294571 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4294572 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4294573 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4294574 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4294575 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4294576 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4294577 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4294578 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4294579 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4294580 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4294581 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4294582 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4294583 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4294584 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4294585 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4294586 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4294587 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4294588 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4294589 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4294590 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4294591 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4294592 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4294593 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4294594 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4294595 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4294596 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4294597 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4294605 when i say think for yourself i dont mean think selfishly for yourself i mean think independently
4294606 if youre going to think for yourself you gotta learn to think clearly
4294607 the person who thinks for herself or himself has to have a sense of humility and of modesty and of relativity because you have to realize that im thinking for myself but hopefully you are too and youre bound to come out with something a little different from me so there has to be an ability to listen compassion plus the modesty no matter how smart we are theres a lot we arent going to be able to figure out tonight

4294611 the idea that any human being should be forced by economics forced to do work that can be done better by a machine or a computer is totally humiliating to any concept of our human dignity and worth

4294630 las razones para cambiar la pel cula al verano son dos sabemos que el verano es la temporada ideal para los lanzamientos familiares lo cual comprobamos con la ltima entrega de harry potter que se convirti en la segunda m s taquillera de esta franquicia s lo despu s de la primera parte
4294631 adem s como todos los dem s estudios seguimos sintiendo las repercusiones de la huelga de escritores que impact la entrega de los guiones de otras pel culas cambiando totalmente el escenario competitivo de 2009 y abriendo nuevos espacios de oportunidad que queremos aprovechar as acordamos que la mejor estrategia era mover el misterio del pr ncipe a julio y con ello llenar perfectamente el hueco que podr a haber a la mitad del verano
4294632 el cambio de fecha no modifica el calendario de producci n de las pr ximas pel culas de harry potter la posproducci n de el pr ncipe mestizo se termin a tiempo y los planes de lanzamiento de harry potter y las reliquias de la muerte en dos partes no se ver n afectadas con esto
4294633 sabemos que los fans est n esperando ansiosos por ver estos ltimos cap tulos en la pantalla grande de hecho la buena noticia para ellos es que ahora el tiempo de espera entre el misterio del pr ncipe y las reliquias de la muerte ser menor
4294634 cuando jeff robinov explic la l gica de mover de fecha la pel cula a julio de 2009 fue obvio que esto nos ofrecer a el potencial de llegar a un p blico m s amplio
4294635 todos estamos esperando compartirla con los fans de harry potter de todo el mundo incluso si tenemos que esperar un poco m s
4294636 ha sido una gran alegr a trabajar en el misterio del pr ncipe dan rupert emma y todo el resto del elenco siguen madurando mientras que los nuevos actores le han tra do color y vida a hogwarts mientras le damos los toques finales a la pel cula estamos preparando ya las siguientes empezaremos a filmar en febrero y estoy muy emocionado de llevar esta incre ble serie hasta el final emocionante que sus fans merecen
4294637 there is a linguistic connection between the three words myth mysticism and mystery all are derived from the greek verb musteion to close the eyes or the mouth all three words therefore are rooted in an experience of darkness and silence
4294638 the mystical experience of god has certain characteristics that are common to all faiths it is a subjective experience that involves an interior journey not a perception of an objective fact outside the self it is undertaken through the image making part of the mind often called the imagination rather than through the more cerebral logical faculty finally it is something that the mystic creates in himself or herself deliberately certain physical or mental exercises yield the final vision it does not always come upon them unawares
4294639 in the east the christian experience of god was characterized by light rather than darkness the greeks evolved a different form of mysticism which is also found worldwide this did not depend on imagery and vision but rested on the apophatic or silent experience
4294640 the mystic call is as a rule the result of an inner rebellion of the conscience against social injustices not only those of others but primarily and particularly against ones own faults with a desire intensified by inner purification to find god at any price
4294641 suhrawardi was examining the visions that are so strikingly similar whether they are seen by shamans mystics or ecstatics in many different cultures jungs conception of the collective unconscious is a more scientific attempt to examine this common imaginative experience of humanity other scholars have attempted to show how the epics of ancient poets and certain kind of fairy tales derive from ecstatic journeys and mystical flights
4294642 instead he should have seen her as a symbol or an avatar that pointed him away from the world to god there are scarcely any physical descriptions in paradise even the blessed souls are elusive reminding us that no human personality can become the final object of human yearning
4294643 when we saw the divine in other people we were making an imaginative effort to uncover the true reality god made the creatures like veils he explained he who knows them as such is led back to him but he who takes them as real is barred from his presence
4294644 the ismailis believed that the noun ilah god sprang from the arabic root wlh to be sad to sigh for as the sacred hadith had made god say i was a hidden treasure and i yearned to be known then i created creatures in order to be known by them there is no rational proof of gods sadness we know it only by our own longing for something to fulfill our deepest desires and to explain the tragedy and pain of life since we are crated in gods image we must reflect god the supreme archetype our yearning for the reality that we call god must therefore mirror a sympathy with the pathos of god ibn al arabi imagined the solitary god sighing with longing but this sigh was not an expression of maudlin self pity it had an active creative force which brought the whole of our cosmos into existence it also exhaled human beings who became logoi words that express god to himself it follows that each human being is a unique epiphany of the hidden god manifesting him in a particular and unrepeatable manner
4294645 it is a two way process god sighs to become known and is delivered from his solitude by the people in whom he reveals himself the sorrow of the unknown god is assuaged by the revealed god in each human being who makes him known to himself it is also true that the revealed god in every individual years to return to its source with a divine nostalgia that inspires our own longing
4294646 this introspective imaginative mysticism was a search for the ground of being in the depths of the self it deprived the mystic of the certainties that characterize the more dogmatic forms of religion any consequent chauvinism about ones own faith at the expense of other peoples was obviously unacceptable since no one religion had the whole truth about god
4294647 where the god of the more dogmatic religions divides humanity into warring camps the god of the mystics is a unifying force
4294648 listen to the reed how it tells a tale complaining of separateness ever since i was parted from the reed bed my lament has caused men and women to moan i want a bosom torn by severance that i may unfold to such a person the power of love desire everyone who is left far from his source wishes back the time when he was united to it

4294675 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4294676 again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4294677 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality

4294700 kenya has only one type ctc crush tear and curl which is suitable only for tea bags china has many varieties of tea but not in the quantities we offer
4294701 no other country has such a wide spread of grades we can service any type of taste from one end of the world to the other with our grades and elevations we can supply any type of taste to any country
4294702 our goal is to achieve 100 percent finished product exports thats the way to survive
4294703 we also have companies here who have already ventured into tea shops creating new lifestyle marketing opportunities
4294704 tea is well and truly identified as a health promoting beverage so tea is now making inroads through high end marketing into areas dominated by coffee
4294705 were competing with multinational brands already established brands which have a 100 year head start
4294706 the type of differentiation strategy sri lanka has in marketing its tea is the main reason why we enjoy high prices

4294713 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

4294717 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4294718 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4294727 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
4294728 trouble at fannie mae and freddie mac stirs concern abroad
4294729 this is their financial system they had demanded paper money federally insured bank deposits and a heavy governmental hand in the distribution of credit and now they have them the populist party might have lost the elections in the hard times of the 1890s but it won the future they got their government controlled money the federal reserve opened for business in 1914 and their government directed credit fannie mae and freddie mac in 1971 they got their pure paper dollar so today the fed can print all the dollars it deems expedient and the unwell federal mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac combine to dominate the business of mortgage origination
4294730 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
4294731 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
4294732 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
4294733 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
4294734 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions
4294735 these twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our american institutions

4294737 that the average individual innovator is having a smaller and smaller impact
4294738 i am in two minds about this biologists have abandoned the idea of progress we just are where we are but humanity is so far in advance of anything that has gone before that it seems to be a qualitative leap
4294739 and i increasingly am persuaded that it is then we will have the technology to deal with it
4294740 torture is a matter that has always been unacceptable beyond discussion lets not pretend those days are passed we now have ticking bomb terrorists and its an empirical fact that every civilised democracy would use torture in those circumstances
4294741 terrorism is a major step backwards in civilisation hitler was a major step backwards sometimes we have to step backwards too to combat such things but progress happens in other areas a generation now growing up may have to accept more security measures and less privacy but in other areas like sexual conduct we are making progress i dont think overall we are making a step back
4294742 the implications are mind blowing civilisation faces the sharpest and perhaps most violent dislocation in recent history

4294746 the following thought experiment frames the problem before us and the essential needs a planetary system of living economies must address
4294747 one morning all six billion wake up with a new awareness their planet is actually a living space ship with a biologically based life support system so overstressed that it is on the verge of collapse
4294748 a few decide to arm themselves kill off as many of their rivals as possible and attempt to secure what they can for themselves
4294749 there is desperate need for a solution that works for all
4294750 the essentials come quickly to mind there must be an immediate reordering of priorities the use of every resource must be optimized to assure the health and physical security of every person with minimal waste the life support system must be restored to full function as quickly as possible everything must be recycled with no release of toxics into the environment there will be no luxuries for the few until the basic needs of all are adequately met

4294772 pienso que si bien es cierto que existe legislaci n a nivel nacional que busca satisfacer mayores coberturas la tendencia es a que los pueblos se vuelvan urbanos nosotros tenemos una poblaci n rural que al parecer tendremos que dejar hu rfana y tan solo con un 20 de los recursos porque el restante ochenta y en el marco de la ley de aguas hay que pignorarlos para atender el rea urbana

4294819 yes i do walk in my sleep with my eyes open i discovered i had it when i was a kid it sounds funny and we laugh about it but my parents have gone through sleepless nights they have become light sleepers since they were always worried about me walking out of the house
4294820 we stay on the ninth floor and i used to walk in my sleep towards the big windows in the hall this frightened my parents so much that they ended up putting grills and started double locking the windows i took homeopathic treatment i tried a lot for a cure but now i dont want to do all of that i am quite used to it and i normally tend to walk around only in my room subconsciously
4294821 people who arent aware of my sleepwalking get petrified once while i was shooting outdoor in the middle of the night i woke up and was trying to break the door lock it woke up all the cast and crew on the same floor and they all wondered what i was up to at another shoot one night we all were having conversations about ghosts later that night i started talking in my sleep and it scared the pants off everyone around
4294822 he didnt want the truth to come out so he worked with the producers to throw me out
4294823 they said i was mentally unstable and they wanted me out on those grounds this happened after a section of the media carried reports about me being mental i have taken them to the sessions court and will take the matter to higher courts if i am not happy with the verdict i am being thrown out for other reasons than what they state i know exactly who is behind all this
4294824 its a pattern aamir is hand in glove with the production house in getting me out of the show he doesnt want people to know the truth and people to see who the real faisal khan is imrans girl friend avantikas related to people in television production and they have played their own game but no one messes with faisal and theres a limit to everything he is messing with my professional life i cant let him do that i want the public to know who i am and not believe the reports they read in the media i wanted to do bigg boss because it would allow the public to see the real me it would show everyone what faisal khan is made of i dont see myself patching up with aamir in the near future i dont believe in giving up if some one tries to put me down i wont sit quiet and suffer i will hit back at anyone who messes with my personal and professional life there is god above who will do justice and i have tremendous faith in him
4294825 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4294826 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4294827 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4294828 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4294829 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4294830 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4294831 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4294832 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4294833 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4294834 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4294835 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4294836 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4294837 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4294838 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4294839 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4294840 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4294841 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4294842 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4294843 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4294844 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4294845 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4294846 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4294847 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4294848 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero

4294853 one person who appears to have benefitted from the fight between shah rukh and salman farah khans husband shirish kundar he has become a regular visitor to galaxy apartments hes been visiting a lot these days and stays there till late night their problems are now in the past while shirish is waiting for his acting career to take off his priority is directing films he doesnt want to be anybodys friend but just focus on his work
4294854 yes we are meeting often we are working on a film together but i cant talk about it however i would like to clarify that its not true that salman and i ever had any problems while working with each other
4294855 the film is not joker its salmans idea and he wants shirish to direct it the talks began when they bumped into each other at an event and connected the film will be a james bond like stylish action thriller with hollywood technicians its being made on a very huge scale and salman might even produce it
4294856 im for strengthening the dollar but i also think weve got to have the economic policies in place for a stronger economy that will over time make sure that the dollar will be stronger

4294858 im all for it and i love to talk it up talk up the strong dollar and i will

4294867 this is a ground war and we need to win this right here in minnesota
4294868 we have got to talk about it in a way that is respectful responsible and historical and until we do that my friends we will allow it to continue to surface in small ugly ways
4294869 i just see him always kind of grasping to kind of get in place
4294870 this is the latest one that i see he was not for drilling and i think we should we need consider all of above and thats a very important issue with me thats a biggie
4294871 i like someone who has tasted defeat and also had victory so he knows both sides of the coin
4294872 ive already seen obama accept victory id like to see him have a little taste of humility
4294873 that group in particular probably values experience and a proven record
4294874 not someone who is an unknown quantity and represents a lack of experience and really a thin record i think they probably value that in a time like this when we have a lot of national security concerns in particular out there

4294879 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4294880 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4294881 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4294882 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4294883 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4294884 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4294885 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4294886 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4294887 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4294922 isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4294923 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4294924 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer

4294945 when she looked at it she determined that due to flooding the river could actually could have been up to that level where the bones were found at that time it deserved a second look

4294947 i guess i am glad that they have this kind of technology now
4294948 at the end of all that process the dna remaining inside the bone samples themselves is in very poor shape and it makes it very difficult to retrieve any dna out of it
4294949 for instance if we have some found human remains and we develop a mitochondrial dna type from there we can now compare that type to suspected brothers or sisters of that individual we can also look at mothers and aunts or female cousins along that line
4294950 thats very useful because it can be very difficult to track down relatives and get dna to have some comparisons to do without the relatives we cant make any identifications at all
4294951 you could use mitochondrial dna on a brand new sample like a blood stain or a hair sample or you could use it on very very old degraded samples like skeletal remains teeth even shed hairs from very cold crime scenes

4294958 i heard him scream and then i saw blood on the floor
4294959 on february 5 the defendant and his pregnant wife were late for an appointment at the royal oldham hospital
4294960 at reception scott morris was taking a call he told the defendant he wouldnt be a moment and to take a seat
4294961 mr morris then had to leave the reception momentarily but indicated he would be back quickly
4294962 mr morris warned the defendant that he would call security and asked if the words were being directed at him
4294963 at this point a health care assistant came to reception and the defendant swore when telling her the man had been on the phone and was ignoring him
4294964 she said the defendant had his finger constantly pressed on the bell
4294965 when she asked him to take a seat the defendant became very agitated he came so close their faces were touching
4294966 he then shouted listen white bitch ill sit down when i want to sit down
4294967 she said he lifted his left hand above his head and she believed he was about to hit her
4294968 a security guard tried to deal with the incident he said the defendant was gesturing with his fingers in the shape of a gun saying ill come back and shoot you
4294969 mr miah attended hospital with his heavily pregnant wife who was suffering problems with her diabetes
4294970 they were a little late for their appointment and the defendant was clearly concerned that they had missed the appointment
4294971 i accept that his behaviour was completely unacceptable but this was a one off loss of control

4294987 the red ribbon will come to be regarded like the yellow star
4294988 hiv positive people have the right to hide their status from sexual partners youre a nazi if you think otherwise
4294989 casting any blame on aids victims for their situation even though aids is 100 percent preventable not the case with tb is thanks to gay artists and their media minions culturally unacceptable
4294990 hiv aids attacks many kinds of people in many different circumstances predictable and otherwise
4294991 sorry my friend but hiv aids here in north america is a gay disease
4294992 rape victims name me some i bet there are very few women unless they were sodomized and yes that is too bad hiv is spread through anal intercourse the vagina has a natural barrier that prevents infections of that kind but they represent such a nugatory percentage of the afflicted that they are statistically immaterial
4294993 if shes giving out information like that she is contributing to hiv infection
4294994 i didnt say every person who gets aids deserves it
4294995 im saying every case is preventable i still blame a person for acting stupidly
4294996 just demonstrates the level of ignorance about the impact of stigma and discrimination on peoples ability to make choices you cant be so black or white as to say having unprotected sex is simply irresponsible behaviour
4294997 you and i may not agree on everything like i dont believe in gay marriage but im a better friend to your community than this guy martin
4294998 why would i have more respect for an hiv positive persons privacy if my daughter or my son is out there getting romantically involved with people
4294999 why should i depend on the goodwill of that person alone to make sure my child doesnt get infected
4295000 id want to have the state on my side with a little more rigour
4295001 i had a great thrill last night i saw clint eastwood a real hero of mine
4295002 considerable influence with opec nations to encourage oil producing countries to increase their oil production
4295003 a line incentive so that we do shift to alternative means of energy
4295004 well i think that we have been slow to move in a better direction when it comes to energy usage
4295005 outstripping supply with china and india growing as rapidly as they are
4295006 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment
4295007 democrats wont admit that we can reduce prices at the pump while still pursuing wind solar and hydrogen sources
4295008 if however the legal aid process is not flawed there is no principled basis for this court to intervene
4295009 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away like that
4295010 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4295011 but unfortunately with weather like that you just cant get the helicopter in
4295012 we have to work hard in the next month to get everything in place to make it happen
4295013 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4295014 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4295015 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4295016 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4295017 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4295034 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape

4295037 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4295041 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4295043 there is nothing you can do for it that just hurts so bad
4295044 my husband was just like you and i are right now talking he was able to order what he wanted and we all ate during the time of our meal he became very quiet
4295045 i was shocked i couldnt believe this i was shocked
4295046 when something happens like high night time temperatures increased mosquito prevalence infected birds it causes a resurgence and thats what has happened here in 2008 it is a late start but it is accelerating why you and i are talking today

4295078 gene ethics presents its online map of commercial gm canola sites being grown this winter as a service to the victorian public
4295079 our map helps fill the information vacuum created when premier brumby lifted victorias 5 year gm canola ban and refused to set up an official register worsening the threat of gm contamination
4295080 affected groups that asked for a register of gm canola sites included gm free growers bee keepers contract harvesters organic growers seed cleaners local councils the municipal association of victoria the victorian local governance association and food processors
4295081 the online map shows farms where the news media have reported that monsantos roundup herbicide tolerant gm canola is being grown or is intended for planting the data is from news reports that confirm some farmers planted gm canola seed this winter and various reports that other farmers intended to grow gm canola
4295082 the farmers and their families named on the gene ethics website may very well fear what these new actions may entail now that their names and locations have been listed publicly
4295083 gene ethics expects to receive more site data to add to the map if gm farmers comply with monsantos stewardship agreement that advises them to tell their neighbours
4295084 the gene technology regulator publishes maps and co ordinates for field trials throughout australia so a similar register for commercial gm crops is practical as well as necessary
4295085 rural industries and land managers are worried by gm seed falling on roadsides during transport and pollen carried 5 km by wind and insects leading to market loss and more persistent roundup herbicide tolerant weeds wild radish and turnip

4295103 never say never im saying never ever never fricking never fricking ever ya heard me the big mistake was my indecisiveness with arranging a meeting place for a date whilst i was the office furiously working knowing that my manager was within earshot i agreed to the first suggestion from my companion for that evening to meet republic curses bloody curses my spidey sense should have immediately begun tingling upon hearing the name given with the address i mean how in the world could i not know of this bastion of faux fusion asian food right smack dab in the middle of union square i completely had no clue this place existed even though i passed it a bajillion times a large restaurant nestled in the heart of union square folks how the heck did i not know of it i saunter into republic with sheer amazement on my face this place is freaking huge and i never knew it existed imagine a college dining hall located in an airplane hangar filled with communal tables got the picture now to the nitty gritty the food is mediocre for the money you will hear no accoloades from me regarding food plain old mediocre then again my appetite and sensory of taste were immediately lost and bitterness entered my system upon my entrance into this cavern ok maybe one of those spring rolls was tasty but that is all u will get from me the ambiance sucks boring interior design with boring neutral colors the staff is polite and courteous so i cant knock them drinks were average now the major monkey killer for me kiddies you cant get physically close to your date nor can you speak in a low tone for just the two of you now if you have read any of my previous reviews you will know that uncle jt places a premium on the kissing proximity to ones partner and the ability to whisper sweet somethings in their ear i mean u have to be able to lean over in some manner and give your honey a smooch a nibble on the ear feed them a few bites or at the very least reach out and stroke their hands across the table republics picnic tables allow none of this closeness to develop they provide a natural no touch barrier we are talking not even able to grope and massage the thigh of the desired party totally deplorable seating i was so mortified by the setup of this place truly my spirit was crushed and i grew restless with the the desire to escape this monstrosity of a romance deterrent i honestly dont know who would bring a love interest to a place like this maybe married people come here or those that dont like to touch while they are eating maybe drunk fratboys come here so they can yell out to each other with the bulk of their verbal musings concerning the sports illustrated swimsuit issue lost in the cacophonous din of the hangar err i mean restaurant jt dont like jt aint going back ever

4295134 we are in michigan 50th in the amount of investment in public higher education
4295135 we have gone down 13 percent from 2002 to 2007 versus the national average of 15 5 percent increase over the same time
4295136 for most of the last century michigan was prosperous largely because of these high paid low skill factory jobs
4295137 from 2000 to 2006 we went from 16th to 26th in per capita income as long as were 34th in terms of graduates our income is going to go toward the mid 30s
4295138 the state has a role tuitions an issue but there are issues much bigger than that
4295139 one of the weaknesses in the higher education community is the belief that when the economy recovers these levels of funding will return thats a mistake
4295140 weve worked very very hard to make sure were as lean as we can be without harming the academic program
4295141 i do think there should be stronger linkage between the business community and higher education because we are part of what fuels the business community
4295142 i wouldnt go to the legislature and say its all your fault because its not i do think in the future there should be better and more intentional intensive relations with the business community
4295143 we here as a group of 15 know each of us has unique capabilities in contributing to the new economy
4295144 we should note where we have our strengths and then be flexible within those strengths that we find to be important to the region that we are operating in
4295145 you cant think of increasing college participation by just increasing your investment aside from the state doesnt have any money
4295146 the difficulty in michigan is any solutions have to be quite targeted
4295147 i applaud the conference organizers for recognizing private higher education contributes to regional economic development in whatever locale it might be
4295148 investments can come not only from the state but from private donors or internships
4295149 were very concerned that those opportunities for support of michigan students who would choose a small private college for a variety of reasons that those funding sources are available to them
4295150 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4295151 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem

4295153 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it

4295180 last year it was in for 10 days no one even knew it because we had enough clams here we got right through it theres years it comes in and moves right out this is very unusual
4295181 what counts is that we provide clams to our customers they book a year in advance they expect clams were doing the best we can and hopefully most people are understanding
4295182 where we see problems its because an athletes been returned to play too soon either because theyre not telling us they still have symptoms because they want to go back to play or because they seem recovered but when we really evaluate them program closely we can tell theyre not fully recovered
4295183 takes 30 45 minutes and then we have baseline data so if any athletes suffer a concussion during the season it gives us a little more info and lets us know when it is that theyre fully recovered
4295184 we try to tell athletes parents and coaches its better to lose a game than a season and better to lose a season than a career if you go back and have other injuries thats where we see the long term problems
4295185 the things insurance buys it pays for the cost of bodily injury and the cost of property damage and to the extent that those things still cost more you could have few accidents but they could be more severe or at least as severe dont look for a huge drop just because of gas prices there are a lot of other things that go into it
4295186 because it is somewhat intuitive that if people are driving less and they are because of higher gas prices that the issues incurred by these companies would be less and that it should filter down into the premiums that are applied to consumers
4295187 wherever i go in the whole world the thing that makes me the saddest is watching people receive communion in the hand

4295193 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4295194 we have shown that it can remove all sorts of everyday stains including coffee and lipstick while using a tiny fraction of the water used by conventional washing machines
4295195 not expected to be dramatically different from conventional washing machines
4295196 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
4295197 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
4295198 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps

4295201 these homes are not fit for anyone to live in
4295202 when we think there is a question of mental illness were going to look at two different tracks one being criminal prosecution and the other being mental illness and whether hospitalization is necessary
4295203 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
4295204 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
4295205 one of out amp equals primary purposes is to train employees how to aggressively promote homosexuality within the company they work for
4295206 from neighborhood to neighborhood coast to coast and around the world mcdonalds is proud to celebrate diversity
4295207 were proud of the homosexuality of our people after all its what makes usairways fly

4295215 at best buy we are committed to having a workforce that is as homosexual as the communities we serve
4295216 im glad my body could do it because now i know i have it in me
4295217 somewhere young william is sharpening his pencil for to the editor meanwhile the folks at the drive through window are beginning to recognize me
4295218 credibility is no longer even an option and the only audience being addressed is so far outside the mainstream
4295219 was a refreshingly pleasant event our visit followed a recent post about the efforts of the lcrc to change
4295220 nnjh you know theres no short answer to this question right to actually deter hate crimes requires a change in peoples hearts
4295221 this is purely circumstantial but it is evidence that affinity to the violent rhetoric of groups like the american family
4295222 it was an instance of curiosity that got away from me
4295223 the court understands i am good kid that made a big mistake
4295224 i wish jonah the best and i know that he will be successful and that he has learned from this and will move on
4295225 and certainly i take his word and statement at court at his word and wish him all the best
4295226 that is very appropriate for a first time offender its a misdemeanor not a felony we know that the state attorney has exp erience with theses cases and knowledge of the law and they looked at his record i trust that they made a good decision
4295227 i am kind of frustrated along with other people in the community with the process of punishment and with the schools decision of pressing charges
4295228 the actions i took were obviously a gross lapse in judgment id like to apologize
4295229 my reasoning was not malicious and i did not intend to hurt anyone even though i realize i did so
4295230 hes just a very gifted young man in the field of computers and he just let this get away from him
4295231 married people are no more a marriage than musicians are music just because some of the people might be wrong doesnt matter it is still right
4295232 butch you know that if it were my money there is nobody that i would rather have steal it than you but you see i am still in the employ of mr eh harriman of the union pacific railroad
4295233 i just dont do interviews thats why i have so many friends
4295234 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4295235 ultimately al qaeda couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4295236 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4295237 anyone who promotes their own blogs should be exterminated is anybody interested really who cares i got out of bed today i had food i performed bodily functions i walked the dogs i had food i went back to bed i sneezed how fascinating is that
4295238 i am so in love with you and i just cant sic stop imagining you in that ss uniform with your ridding crop glistening with my own blood after you have given me a beating because i really deserve it
4295239 y ou half wit if she wants to have a child with you lets hope it doesnt inherit your moronic stupidity and shallowness wipe the drool from this imbeciles face please
4295240 this guy is tres funny his observations are both witty and at times biting social commentary
4295241 go back to your stupid random blog you consistent buffoon
4295242 mr surname is a small part of a large movement that seeks to push all of us to the brink of insanity
4295243 also check out john is too funny he will make you gag for it hahaha hes really funny has intersting sic site

4295246 coach ginipro did an excellent job in his first season at asu and were pleased to have him on board for at least three more years
4295247 hes a great fit for appalachian and im confident that hell lead the program to future championships
4295248 in case you werent sure today was a great reminder that were all rooting for the worst run organization in baseball theres not another franchise with worse leadership or more incompetence in positions of power from the ceo on down these people dont know baseball they dont know how to run a baseball team build a roster or win baseball games
4295249 our last hope is that the mariners put washburn back on waivers this month yes they still can do that if a player is put on revocable waivers and is claimed there is two days to work out a trade if no trade was made such as in this case the player can be put on waivers one more time but is automatically on irrevocable waivers
4295250 frankly this team has to decide whether its going to contend or rebuild next year
4295251 i see him all the time at least once a week
4295252 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
4295253 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
4295254 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
4295255 i wouldnt change out my senator right now for a bet on anything
4295256 i trust his judgment thats why i voted for him
4295257 these allegations apparently involve sen stevens legislative actions votes and decisions
4295258 the indictment alleges a series of official acts that on their face appear to fall within the protections of the speech or debate clause
4295259 only the senate may discipline a senator for violating the senates rules and congress cannot delegate that authority to the executive branch
4295260 there were no harnesses like todays rides yet the loop the loop claimed an amazing safety record the cars had rubber wheels carried four passengers and used only centrifugal force to remain on the tracks nothing else many advertisements claimed a glass of water on the seats made the trip without spilling a drop it was one of the first rides to charge admission just to watch but it had a flaw only four passengers per five minutes rode the loop the loop without consistent revenue the former toast of coney island barely survived into world war i
4295261 trying to get to 124 for the second time now he regretted that conversation the high tone he took his refusal to see the effect of marrow weariness in a woman he believed was a mountain
4295262 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
4295263 in those whose behaviour is exclusively heterosexual safe sex practices are less common if there was an outbreak of hiv amongst heterosexuals in australia it would clearly spread more rapidly than it would in the gay community
4295264 charts a course without any additional risk cost or delay to republic
4295265 would require significant financing to complete and if incremental debt were used for the transaction could result in credit metrics at wmi that fall deeper into speculative grade rating territory
4295266 todo mundo tem um pouco de ansiedade tanto adulto quanto crian a
4295267 were used to playing this game without brad penny its been a fact of life for the last month or so
4295268 this is not a silent movie our voices will save our lives
4295269 dood was als ik niet meer wakker was geworden en ik had het nooit geweten
4295270 telling a late person just to be on time is a little like telling a dieter to simply stop eating so much
4295271 repetitive lateness is more often related to personality characteristics such as anxiety or a penchant for thrill seeking
4295272 some people are drawn to the adrenaline rush of that last minute sprint to the finish line while others receive an ego boost from over scheduling and filling each moment with activity
4295273 people who are late tend to misjudge the time needed to accomplish even those things theyve done hundreds of times like getting dressed for work
4295274 youre creating a reputation for yourself and its not the best reputation to be establishing people feel they cant trust you or rely on you
4295275 if youre always late by a different amount of time five minutes sometimes 15 or even 40 minutes other times it is likely that the cause is technical that means you are not good at estimating how long things take
4295276 enforcing the tardy policy by a teacher is based on personality so its hard to be consistent in the end when students know something is going to happen they will act
4295277 the dream was to make something that can be alive and hang out with you play with you and live with you
4295278 one of our manufacturing engineers a grizzled marine guy took one over to the veterans hospital
4295279 he didnt know how the guys would respond but they just loved it they wanted one just to hang around with
4295280 i saw him win wire to wire every step with him because at night he would come back and talk about it
4295281 he said to me sunday night if i can do it you can do it
4295282 blouse with a bias front yoke and front draped neckline is lightly fitted by a french dart in front and vertical back darts has a center back zipper
4295283 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4295284 again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4295285 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4295286 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4295287 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4295288 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4295289 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4295290 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4295291 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4295292 1 will there be any more vorkosigan novels i would love to see a book about ivan finally growing up one resolving marks relationship with kareen and just a couple plain old adventures for aral and cordelia on sergyar lmb yes there is a new miles book under contract with baen in progress it doesnt have a title yet but its up to chapter 4 still a long way to go i expect to have it finished by mid 2009 for publication probably early 2010 it will be a lord auditor vorkosigan mystery adventure in a fresh setting with a lot of new characters and a few old favorites since i read the first two chapters at worldcon last week its public knowledge that miles will be 39 in this book it doesnt have a title yet nor a 5th chapter but that will come 2 when you created the chalion universe was it always your intention to move to a different time period for the autumn book
4295293 this isnt so much a question for lois mcmaster bujold as a comment i just wanted to express my appreciation for the wonderful character of miles vorkosigan in fiction and for your kindness in reality my niece has cp cerebral palsy and during her teen years she had the difficulty of coping with her cp in addition to the usual teen angst i introduced her to the vorkosigan books at a critical time in her life and miles made an impression on her to such an extent that we took her to i think it was baltimore to a convention so she could see you speak you ended up sitting behind us at a presentation and were very kind to one of your biggest fans she is now a speech pathologist married with three children and still one of your biggest fans lmb that is deeply cool give her my best regards susan as far as a question did your characters come before your world building lmb yes usually the whole series started with aral and cordelia i built their world outward from them after that it became rather a feedback loop with characters settings and situations building on each other susan adds thank you for many years of reading pleasure as a family we buy multiple copies of your books as not one of us is willing to be the second to read your stories
4295294 what is your relationship currently with baen books if you do another vorkosigan book will it be with them even though jim has passed away
4295295 thank you for taking the time to field our questions
4295296 how much planning do you do before you begin writing your novels do you know how its going to end before you begin writing or does the story kind of take off on its own
4295297 i read somewhere that you enjoyed writing the vorkosigan novels almost as much as i enjoyed reading them because you didnt know what the characters were going to do next even while writing the stories having read all of the vorkosigan novels i have to applaud the creativity they show especially as mr malozzi states they focus more on the characters and less on the technical details my question as an very amateur writer and editor is to ask how much of your rough drafts make it into the final storylines and since im sure that not everything makes it to the final story which aspects of the story or character do you review primarily in the editing stages lmb partly answered above by the time i get to the final edit all the structural revisions have been done except for minor clean ups and tweaks also out of curiousity and without any pressure i tried not to ask but my willpower failed me can we expect to see additional novels in the vorkosigan universe someday
4295298 comment for ms bujold i just want to say that i read the two books that make up cordelias honor separately waaaaayy back when we wont go into just how far back when and thoroughly enjoyed them
4295299 ms bujold thank you for taking our questions i was surprised to find out that you have a midwest background considering the choice of names in ch the names piotr aral kareen gregor have an eastern european or russian feel to them was this intentional from where do you get your people and place names
4295300 i also wanted to comment on how realistic alys birth scene was i appreciated the little details much better than the over dramatic exaggerated births with crazy hysterical out of control women that are too often found in books or on tv
4295301 i see a couple of my questions have already been asked by others so my own list will be unusually short first does any of the cover art to your vorkosigan books capture what you picture the characters to be in your minds eye i noticed mr m says aral reminds him of a young robert davi myself i picture more of a gregory peck and somehow ive never been able to match my own mental picture of miles to any of the cover art ive seen as the creator of the characters i wonder how you view it
4295302 you have produced a number of fantasy works including the excellent curse of chalion do you have a preference of genres and is there a genre you have wanted try that you have not yet written for thank you very much for your time and participation here ms bujold and thanks to mr mallozzi for hosting your visit
4295303 your presence on joes blog has encouraged me to stop lurking and post a comment thank you for coming 1 i really enjoy your vorkosigan books and was wondering since that storyline has slowed down whether you would consider starting a more action oriented space opera sci fi series
4295304 questions for lmb 1 will there be more vorkosigan books in the future maybe looking at ivan or one of the younger vorkosigans
4295305 also barrayar is both very militaristic and at the same time almost fuedal theyre very odd political structures to mix together might is right versus birth determining ones station in life why this particular political structure for barrayar
4295306 thanks for your time and for writing such amazingly awesome books and for the butterbugs because life just wouldnt be life without a hefty helping of butterbugs
4295307 i noticed as i read this book that while cordelia changed dramatically in her attitude and behavior aral remained essentially and constantly aral
4295308 well duh thats why the book is called cordelias honor
4295309 also in your end comments you mention that you did not write this series in chronological order did you always know the whole back story or did it develop in pieces as you were writing them
4295310 but i think what most intrigued me in these books was the reproductive storyline i guess thats my question for lmb was it your intent to make any sort of statement about women with looking at this particular technology i alternate between seeing this plotline as an indictment of reproductive assistance and a celebration of a womans control over her own body
4295311 questions for lois 1 what is your favorite part of writing is it the characters planning the plot or something different the fans accolades lmb making it up writing it down the beginning where its all fresh and the ending where it all comes together if it does i am not so fond these days of all the pr chores which seem to have multiplied im partly a victim of my own success i suspect 2 what started you writing a teacher in high school the need to tell stories you imagined etc was it always a career you had in mind oh my lets do this link http www dendarii com biolog html short answer started in 8th grade i needed to tell stories and i didnt seriously tackle it as a career till my early 30s after a long hiatus in my 20s when id more or less forgotten what i was about 3 you write both fantasy and sci fi which was your first do you have a preference which is easier to write how do you keep the two from blending together or do you let them i admit i havent had a chance to read your fantasy novels lmb i have no preference i like both i dont have any trouble keeping them separate the technical aspects of putting together a novel characterization plotting pacing worldbuilding etc are largely the same across the related genres fantasy seems to have a higher bar for literary style i started in sf adding fantasy with the spirit ring in 1992 but not getting back to it till the turn of the millennium brought the chance to do the curse of chalion 4 what kind of advice would you give someone keen on writing publishing fantasy and sci fi works lmb breaking in today is too different from the for my advice to be current but read a lot watch a lot do and listen and learn a lot this will fill the well you must draw upon write it finish it send it out there is no secret handshake alas 5 what drew you to the space opera genre is it your own personal reading preference something you just had to tell or something else lmb personal preference it just seemed a fun sort of tale and fell out naturally 6 who are some of your favorite fantasy sci fi authors and books any youre meaning to read shortly here
4295312 questions for lois do you treat each sequel as distinct from the previous ones when you think about how to introduce characters in the plot by that i mean how do you balance between writing for long standing readers and new readers when writing a sequel
4295313 are you surprised by the popularity of some of your secondary characters like simon and ivan
4295314 did you ever consider writing more about aral and cordelia or do you think that once characters marry that the range of story you can tell is limited
4295315 1 in joes critique he said he pictured a young robert davi as captain aral vorkosigan first what do you think of his casting and second when you are writing do you ever imagine any particular actor in a role if any of your books were ever to become a major motion picture
4295316 a proper series is neither an extension of the novel as in the multi volume single story nor a replication as when essentially the same story is told over and over cookie cutter fashion but another animal altogether with its own internal demands
4295317 one must assume that readers will encounter the books in utterly random order each series novel must be simultaenously a complete tale in itself and uphold its unique place in the growing structure it must be two books at once
4295318 how does it feel to be compared to other authors
4295319 the betan and barrayan societies and worlds are diametrically opposite in many if not all ways
4295320 my second question is about the closing chapter of shards of honor where boni finds the body of her own daughter
4295321 i would like to read more about miles which would be the next book in these series i should read
4295322 if any of your novels gets greenlight for a movie would you preferred live action cgi animation or motion capture animation for the movie especially for the vor game since i consider it to have the most action sequences
4295323 what is your ideal writing environment like do you need to be in a certain room of the house have a certain ambiance or background noises do you listen to music or write in silence does a certain time of day work better for you or does it matter do you have to pound away at a keyboard or need the tactile sensations of a pen dancing over paper
4295324 lil where are you supposed to pee pee at miss sharis house
4295325 good do you go pee pee on miss sharis carpet
4295326 oh dats right pee pee on dee teeny tiny potty
4295327 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4295328 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4295329 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4295330 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4295331 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
4295332 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
4295333 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans
4295334 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation
4295335 absolutely absolutely particulary with those that number of complaints i know the attorney general is very concerned about that
4295336 2 000 would complete my purchase and they would deliver my furniture
4295337 env an 200 o 300 d lares o lo que puedan contribuir hacia una elecci n presidencial que bien podr a determinar cu ndo regresar n a casa

4295339 represents the largest single photovoltaic commitment from an electric utility anywhere in the world
4295340 there are a lot of things i am pleased with
4295341 am i satisfied no im not satisfied youve seen the growth and i always believe its good to get away to training camp even though we continue in training camp mode when we go back up to winter park
4295342 training camp is like boot camp any time its over is definitely a good feeling
4295343 being a running back its definitely frustrating but like i say all the time im willing to go out and do whatever it takes to help win that game
4295344 if thats catching 20 passes a game then ill do that im pretty sure ill be getting some carries this year
4295345 theres still quite a few that was there when i was there so im looking forward to playing against them again
4295346 its hard to image that more than 120 000 children in colorado suffer from hunger
4295347 the funds raised from this years event will support our local efforts to end childhood hunger and supply low income families with the foods they need to lead healthy active lives
4295348 you are skinny when peggy is already skinny and if you were peggy how would you have interpreted the remark
4295349 tania do you think i still look sick and pale
4295350 do i still look drawn like you told me earlier
4295351 i didnt say that what i said was your face looked like it lost weight and when one isnt smiling one looks paler and their face looks thinner
4295352 is tania implying that she never thought i was skinny before my two day illness
4295353 no tania was not saying that at all all tania said was that your face looked skinnier on 20 24 31 2008 08 14 says
4295354 wait a second it may be the glasses they are an old pair and magnified
4295355 yes it is the glasses you are skinny you know i was wondering why that when i was walking over here that the buildings seemed bigger and weird looking
4295356 marie you are small the glasses make everything look bigger on 20 25 50 2008 08 14 says these are the last two story one my question after you read the story do you agree with susan that all kerry is saying is that patti is thin with shape kerri patti arent you a size 5 6 patti didnt say a word kerri last week the temp that worked for me looked at you and said that girl has to be a size 5 6
4295357 no kerri does not think you have big hips she even told you that she just means you are thin but you have shape to you
4295358 mary you are thin skinny and cannot be more than a size 4 and not more than 110 pounds
4295359 so why did sandy say average and size 10 if everyone sees me as skinny thin size 4
4295360 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
4295361 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4295362 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4295363 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4295364 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4295365 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
4295366 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4295367 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4295368 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4295369 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4295370 each file with two or three or four up to 20 profiles
4295371 cumulatively there were about 300 profiles collected in that one day
4295372 we realized that it was a phishing attack of course but also that these phishers timed it with an apple event
4295373 it looks like that raised the conversion rate of their captures
4295374 some of the users who we talked to were very sophisticated users but they still fell for this attack
4295375 looks clean and sleek the text courteous and professional hardly the kind that instantly gives away it away as a fake or scam
4295376 the dream was to make something that can be alive and hang out with you play with you and live with you
4295377 one of our manufacturing engineers a grizzled marine guy took one over to the veterans hospital
4295378 he didnt know how the guys would respond but they just loved it they wanted one just to hang around with
4295379 its hard to say if its something well see replicated in other states
4295380 there is really no point in doing this on small scale
4295381 if youre going to make a difference youve got to do it big
4295382 we need politicians with the guts to say that but i dont see that
4295383 say the right words and set goals to reduce emissions but their actions prove they dont mean it
4295384 the really crucial thing here is that one of the worlds leading scientists is drawing attention to the need for strong bold action
4295385 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4295386 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4295387 the topaz solar farm will grow clean electricity on previously disturbed unused farmland with low profile panels minimizing visual impact
4295388 its designed to be compatible with key wildlife species and avoid environmentally sensitive areas
4295389 we are now here with technology available now that will allow solar to take its place among central station power plants with wind geothermal gas and coal
4295390 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4295391 thats really good news because the department of energy predicts we will need 386 gigawatts by 2015 just to keep up with load growth this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future
4295392 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4295393 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4295394 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4295395 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4295396 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4295397 very limited to a light patrolling ability such as a few kilometers outside of south ossetia not the right to maintain a presence inside georgia
4295398 the trick is the french need to clarify language and toughen it up so that it isnt an open ended right
4295399 the russians insisted on language that was so open they could drive a tank through it
4295400 and we told the french the georgians cant accept this as is and frankly we dont blame them this needs to be limited in a way that is hard and specific
4295401 some fundamental factors lead us to believe consumer inflation is at or near its peak
4295402 we are optimistic the relief in energy prices since mid july will mean the large monthly increases in the consumer price index energy which occurred in four of the last five months will cease furthermore we anticipate aggressive discounting from retailers as consumer activity wanes throughout the second half
4295403 the market believes weak growth and weakened demand will arrest inflation
4295404 thats why treasuries survived that 0 3 increase in core cpi
4295405 measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of waist to hip ratio or waist circumference should be used
4295406 the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
4295407 if the waist to hip ratio values were greater than 0 97 for men and 0 84 for women then individuals faced almost eight times increased risk for stroke compared to individuals with a waist to hip ratio less than 0 92 in men or less than 0 78 in women
4295408 is an appropriate measure to assess the risk of stroke and tia comparable to waist circumference
4295409 by using different statistical approaches it was confirmed that waist to hip ratio appeared to be the strongest predictor of stroke and tia risk
4295410 most americans are fair minded and dont think that way
4295411 were not asking people to vote for obama because hes black were asking them to vote for him because hes the best and happens to be black
4295412 he was very vociferous against america and was vilifying president wilson
4295413 i told him to stop and he didnt so i took my little fist and hit him over the face i gave him a knuckle sandwich
4295414 i was very ashamed of myself because i had a pistol under my jacket and he was unarmed
4295415 within a week about 600 guys with my appeal crossed the lines
4295416 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4295417 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust
4295418 in the absence of any negative coverage from the msm
4295419 im hoping theres another book soon that will detail obamas narcissism in detail the adoration of the msm for obama is only equaled by obamas self adoration
4295420 im hoping theres another book soon that will detail obamas narcissism in detail
4295421 i cant wait for someone to poke a hole and let some hot air out of his grandiosity and harvard elitism
4295422 in the absence of any negative coverage from the msm
4295423 i support mccain and i do not care about mr corsis book i will not read it it will not change my mind my concerns about obama are not the type that can be dismissed as easily as it appears mr corsis book can be what would sen obama have done in response to russias aggression on georgia what will he do when russia shows aggression against the ukraine what will he do when iran shows aggression against iraq or israel dont respond by complaining about the current administration we arent voting on that administration

4295428 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

4295432 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4295433 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4295434 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can

4295441 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4295442 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4295443 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4295444 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4295445 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4295446 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4295447 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4295448 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4295449 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4295450 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4295451 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

4295468 the principles of arminianism are the natural dictates of a carnal mind which is emnity both to the law of god and to the gospel of christ and next to the dead sea of popery into which this stream also runs they have from pelagius on to this day been the greatest plague of the church of christ and it is likely will be till his second coming
4295469 there is not a minister that deals seriously with the souls of men but he finds an arminian scheme of justification in every unrenewed heart and is it not sadly to be bewailed that divines ministers should plead that same cause that we daily find the devil pleading in the hearts of all natural men

4295486 we covered a good bit of situations that can come up at different points in a game working fourth and long fourth and goal passing situations late game situations as players as coaches we have to work on these now because during a game week its hard to get much in on these
4295487 we had some good competition especially in the overtime drills going good on good and with the second team and younger guys
4295488 kasey had a good day hes had a good camp the kind we expected after the year he had last season
4295489 byron had a better day than weve seen lately he looked like what we got used to seeing last year
4295490 i know what robert does we need to see these new guys and they need to earn the trust of the players so we divided the team and half were rooting for one guy half for the other it was fun to watch ben landry won it with a 48 yard field goal under some serious pressure from his team
4295491 aarrgh what are you talking about i hate all of those hideous melonheads with a burning white hot passion
4295492 look pick a favorite family circus character or ill blow your brains out
4295493 well they didnt have it in stores but i found it online it was actually as easy as clicking a button
4295494 thats technology today things are almost too easy to find
4295495 tee hee why did you say too easy in bold letters
4295496 but being in marketing we thought we would write an email afterwards to let them know so they could improve their service
4295497 back then the technology worked but wasnt in the right format and you couldnt use it in a commercial environment
4295498 the challenge was could we make it smaller a scale down rather than a scale up risk
4295499 weve got about 50 clients using or trialling the device the most encouraging response is that after the trials most are coming back with big orders alcoa started with five and came back with an order for 50
4295500 i can say that there is no price resistance from the companies were dealing with
4295501 thats one of the most significant aspects about what were experiencing
4295502 our industrial customers such as alcoa and boeing have a huge need in protecting the hearing of workers but in also allowing them to communicate on the job
4295503 boeing started by using four or five sensear devices on its 777 production line in seattle kenworth did the same thing starting with three units now the quote is in for 100
4295504 the alcoa experience reflects the issue confronted by a lot of companies they told us that theyve spent millions of dollars trying to engineer noise out of the workplace but the incidence of noise induced hearing loss continues to rise
4295505 one of the advantages of our system is that we can record the exposure of workers to noise after a days use we can download the data for each individual wearer which shows his exposure
4295506 if you put a gps global positioning system in it the customer will then be able to create a noise map of the site

4295513 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4295514 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4295515 the rate of redistribution of some water birds has been dramatic in recent years but for some species we still know little about the extent to which decreases in numbers in the uk are due to redistribution to other parts of their range or real decreases in overall numbers
4295516 it is vital that we learn more about the extent and consequences of redistribution in order to ensure that these species are effectively conserved
4295517 every year a network of 500 bto volunteers monitor 30 000 nests providing an enormous wealth of information about the changes in nesting activities of many of our birds
4295518 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
4295519 because the story answers to most of the myths and preconceptions westerners already have about soviet life the problem will be to make sure that students read it with the same degree of resistance with which they would normally confront any other piece of fiction

4295530 we believe the vehicle is both aesthetically pleasing and extremely efficient
4295531 by minimizing aero drag we can maximize the range of the battery
4295532 so it shouldnt come as any surprise that my exterior design team spent countless hours in the wind tunnel with our aerodynamicist to refine the volts exterior we believe this was time well spent when youre trying to extend gas free driving of the vehicle youll take all the efficiency you can get
4295533 in the next 10 years we will experience more change than in the 50 years before

4295540 what is it about emptiness that makes us want to move away from it
4295541 it is the most surprising and liberating discovery to find that everything that really matters in life such as peace joy strength power clarity value or worth support nourishment and love can be found within you and not just when you are lucky enough to be already experiencing them fully but also when it seems like they are absent and have never been there once you have discovered them in the sense of lack and incompleteness many times then it becomes possible to just relax and know they are always there no matter what the present moment feels like
4295542 this is the polar opposite of what americans are about the individual and individual rights the chinese disapprove greatly of that shameless self promotion and conspicuous consumption are considered acceptable here even enviable perhaps

4295544 i want to obviously talk to the commanders and get a sense both in afghanistan and in baghdad of what their biggest concerns are
4295545 and i want to thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
4295546 i endorse him and i throw my full support behind him
4295547 senator obama and senator clinton did have occasion to meet this evening its the end of the primary process and they wanted to talk about bringing these campaigns together in unity and bringing this party together as we go forward in the fall

4295560 well well we need to talk to you for a bit if youre up for it
4295561 we need to know about what happened to you john thats why the da is here and dr perteet is going to monitor you and make sure you are up for talking
4295562 why dont you start with when you got picked up
4295563 now if at any point you feel tired or in pain you let me know and we can pick this up later alright
4295564 well im guessing you found mine and ruizs car i couldnt believe how it went down i was coming back from the raid at the delamora residence on allison dr near buford highway i was turning at valmar and autumn dr to get to the hospital to check on deputy ruiz i was turning right off of valmar when another automobile came and slammed into my drivers side door it was a really good wreck what really dazed me was my head impacting the window when my car hit the lamppost
4295565 before i could move these two hispanic men opened the drivers side door and dragged me out of the car even though they had crushed the door they ripped through it like christmas wrapping their strength was unnatural i was thrown onto the asphalt i could feel the little pieces of sand on the road burrowing into my hands and face as they beat and kicked me until i blacked out
4295566 i woke up alone on a dirt floor at one time i must have been upright for my hands and feet were bound to a wooden chair the ground near my feet was saturated with water yet by my head it was as dry as ash i could smell something like engine oil and something else chemical and metallic in the air the air was cold and goosebumps prickled my skin they had stripped me except for my boxers i suppose i should be thankful they let me have some decency
4295567 i was trying to get a sense of my surrounding perhaps even figure out where i was when behind me i heard surprise i got popped in the temple and blacked out again
4295568 i woke up again i dont know how long i was out but this time i was upright my feet were still in the mud i could feel people surrounding me and their eyes crawled across my skin
4295569 i heard footsteps near me and the click of a switch
4295570 i heard laughter come from around the room from the laughter i knew that this voice was the one in charge for every laugh was forced
4295571 the spotlight was turned off and i was in the warmth of darkness again a few moments later overhead lights were brought up the sudden changes in brightness was disorienting but i was soon able to finally see my surroundings my ribcage ached and my skin felt as though it had been stretched across my chest i was in the center of a warehouse the floor was concrete yet some places such as where i was sitting were covered in inches thick layers of dirt the walls were cinder blocks and steel the ceiling was arched with exposed rusted metal beams light fixtures seemed strung up randomly across the ceiling in some places boards had been placed between the beams making a makeshift second story
4295572 i was surrounded by a huge press of people yet the only sweat i could smell was my own all of them wore white shoes and dark blue jeans they wore stark white t shirts or undershirts a few were shirtless and the couple of black t shirts i saw read silver 13 everywhere i looked were closely shaven heads and sinister tooth filled smiles i could have sworn that a good number of them had their teeth filed to points or wore grills fashioned into fangs
4295573 what really stuck out was the tattoos every one of them was covered in ink many sported our lady of f tima on their arms or backs others sported fanged skulls with crossed letter ms still every tattoo had one thing in common a blazing red rose
4295574 i scanned the smiling and satisfied faces in the room
4295575 the room laughed again the man in front of me bent down his shaved head and the rose on his shoulder shined in the light it was the same voice that had mocked me earlier you think we dont know who you are you think we worry about maric
4295576 he stood up again turned his back to me and almost danced towards his audience
4295577 two men picked me and my chair up and set me upright they couldnt have been more than fourteen but they stood me up as if they were straightening up a toy in a childs room the man in charge of this group of sure o was still standing in front of me though now he was a few feet away his skin was pale under the harsh lighting and he looked at me with a mixture of amusement and disdain officer garza he said to me we dont want much from you we dont want to kill you we just want a little bit of information from you comprende we just want you to tell us what happened at the bust on allison kay the light gleamed off the sharp points of his canines as he gave me a contemnible smile
4295578 you ever look back at your life and wonder what the fuck you were thinking
4295579 he left the room he just left me to the mercy of the men surrounding me surprisingly it was the two fourteen year olds who took charge one had his head clean shaven while the other had black hair slicked back and wore a tetchy little mustache
4295580 people forget that the point of torture isnt to cause damage its to cause pain and fear and they did they were good at it too those little boys brought out another chair they gently tipped my chair to the dusty ground their faces held no malice or anticipation just cold efficiency the bottom of my chair was lifted into the air and set on the chair that was brought in while my head stayed on the ground the blood rushed to my head and i could hear it thumping in my ears
4295581 with that same coldness the boys showed me the wooden rulers they had been holding in their back pockets the eyes of the mustachioed boy gleamed my heart was a jackhammer as they commenced to whipping the soles of my feet the thwack of the rulers never found a rhythm so i could never anticipate their blows
4295582 it wasnt like the movies they didnt ask me any questions or if i would talk they just kept hurting me i dont know how long it lasted all i know is that it hurt
4295583 it wasnt just my feet though the boys kept it varied i guess it was so i wouldnt get bored after i had shit or pissed myself they would clean me up by spraying me down with a hose pistol after they had soaked me they would aim it at my upturned face and would blast it at full power i felt like i couldnt breathe and i gasped for air while the water scoured my skin afterwords my face would feel raw and the air current would scrape against me this is when the audience would laugh and insult me but never the boys no they just went about their work
4295584 the only time the boys ever made a noise was when i was upright it was then that i was cleaned up guns would be pointed at me so i wouldnt try to run even though by this time i was in too much pain to move on my own i was untied and two buckets of water would be brought over with soap and a brush my arms were lifted and my boxers removed then i was scrubbed down gently like washing a child the bald child would look at me and say every time this is so you wont get an infection he would then placidly put rubbing alcohol on any open wounds on my face and on my wrists and ankles where the rope and rubbed through my flesh fresh boxers would then be brought to me this is the only time when no one joked somehow it was a solemn occasion
4295585 after i was cleaned i would be tied back to the chair one of their favorite things to do after i was clean was to bring a stool on which a fishing reel had been attached small fishhooks were used to pierce my chest the hooks were then slowly reeled in stretching my skin i could feel it pulling all the way from the small of my back with each click of the reel
4295586 the worst though was when i was left alone seemingly at random a signal would buzz through the audience and they would all leave except for the boys i would be strung up upside down by my chair cotton would be stuffed in my ears so all i could hear was the dull roar of my own body and a blindfold would be tied across my eyes i spun slowly when they shut off the lights and all the while no one said a word
4295587 sartre was wrong hell isnt other people its being trapped in your own mind during this time i ceased to exist no one had acknowledged me in so long that i and me were gone and i had forgotten my own name due to lack of hearing it i just knew that no one was going to help me and that the only kindness i was ever going to receive again was when i was bathed
4295588 still i wouldnt talk i wouldnt cooperate not that they ever asked me to or asked me anything for that matter i just kept telling them that i wasnt going to give them anything they wanted
4295589 one day or night i couldnt tell which the boy with the bald head looked at me with sullen eyes and intoned to me in a mournful voice gunsmoke gama coming i will miss you he hugged me and i cried i couldnt stop myself i could do nothing but weep for the boy whose name i never knew was going to miss me
4295590 the crowd parted for the person moving through the crowd it was him the man with the rose on his shoulder and the gleaming teeth he looked exactly the same as he did before same bright white undershirt the same closely shaven head the same dark blue jeans he shone as he walked up to me god he was beautiful
4295591 i wasnt going to tell him even after all i had been through there was no way i was going to tell him anything
4295592 disappointment mangled his face i was surprised i expected a smart remark or an insult he didnt even get angry he just seemed hurt more than anything he locked eyes with mine and i was lost the me that i had regained from hearing my name was taken away again and i started to talk
4295593 i told him everything i told him about waking up next to my girlfriend i told him what i had for breakfast that day i told him about calling the girl i was cheating on her with while i was on my way to work i told him everything about what happened the day of the drug bust on allison drive
4295594 the room was silent while i talked except for faint whisperings and the creaking of my chair
4295595 since it was so late in the day to get a warrant ruiz and i had to call several judges at home to get one of them to grant us a no knock warrant so we could raid the place
4295596 the great thing about drug raids is that everyone wants in on them
4295597 by this time we had everything ready to go it was 1 oclock in the morning
4295598 the second it happened without thinking like i had been trained to i spun towards the door and kicked its remains in
4295599 by this time the other officers had entered the house
4295600 edwin delamora was taken to a hospital along with deputy ruiz
4295601 however as soon as they were in the house the dogs went crazy
4295602 what we found under the house is something that will stay with me forever
4295603 when i regained my sight what appeared before me made my eyes widen with shock and caused me to lose even more faith in humanity
4295604 i called on the radio for paramedics to come down here and proceeded to cut free the boy
4295605 as soon as he was free the boy lunged at me
4295606 the boy was now beneath the opening i had hacked into the floor earlier
4295607 thats all i know i was trying to decide what to say in my report when you abducted me i dont know what to do i know what i saw but no one is going to believe me i wouldnt believe it if it was someone else i exclaimed to gama and his men
4295608 gama then turned to his audience and shouted out however no one will believe you were kidnapped without some better scars have fun boys with that he and the two boys left the audience of hoodlums and barrio rats swarmed me and beat me quickly i was slammed to the ground my mouth was filled with mud they kicked me and hit me and struck me i was a pi ata off its rope my nose crunched beneath someones heel and i soon passed out
4295609 thats all i can tell you about what happened i know it sounds crazy but it is all true everything else about what happened you already know the next time i woke up i was here and was being borne on a stretcher to my room
4295610 our fathers had plenty of deer and skins our covers full of flesh and fowl
4295611 it is supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment to his home than the settled civilized christian
4295612 treaties were expedients by which ignorant intractable and savage people were induced without bloodshed to yield up what civilized peoples had a right to possess
4295613 such a denial of justice and such deafness to screams for mercy never heard in times of peace does this government think that the people of the united states are become savage and mad
4295614 we call them brothers but steal their land it has to stop
4295615 john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it
4295616 thus far advanced further than any other nation or tribe in america
4295617 the cherokees were adamant about staying on land and being a sovereign nation they wrote a constitution went to church and had a school
4295618 why follow that narrow old road when fast new super highways beckon
4295619 your way is no better than any other every path leads to the same universal end eternal bliss with a loving god
4295620 i didnt see these hard places on the roadmap what happened
4295621 he is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what cannot lose
4295622 of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who set their mind on earthly things for our citizenship is in heaven
4295623 to you o lord i lift up my soul o my god i trust in you teach me your paths lead me in your truth and teach me for you are the god of my salvation on you i wait all the day
4295624 blessed are the people who know the joyful sound they walk o lord in the light of your countenance in your name they rejoice all day long
4295625 they gave me two whole weeks to be free but after friday dont expect to see me for the rest of the month
4295626 see im invoking my revenge clause on marko man and i need the perfect bait as it stands you two qualify
4295627 you break into my house and expect us to be used as bait disgusting leave or get the non marko man ass kicking of your life
4295628 is that supposed to be a joke about how marko always beat me
4295629 no its an accurate prediction of whats about to happen
4295630 they never make for good fights let me blow this place up super teleport
4295631 you try to blow my house up then you say oops oh i got your accident
4295632 im just enacting my revenge clause upon you you see a few months ago you killed my child it drove me crazy and the only way i could contain myself was to use the shin drive now im going to make you a mess and when its all said and done you will not exist
4295633 thats a tall order from someone whos fake turbo charge
4295634 okay cause as far as im concerned you could die again right now
4295635 youre gonna rejuvinate then youre gonna use rage youve been doing this since forever
4295636 with the shin drive in town you just might get it
4295637 you have no idea how pitiful you look in my eyes let me put you out of your misery
4295638 i could definitely get used to this its the sole reason i let you live well not the sole reason but upon my win it was the first thing that came to mind you know keeping you around so that i could win some more besides you know how it works you have to win at least twice so that you know its not a fluke
4295639 my plan for revenge started out really simple kill marko man
4295640 now it has become so much more than that how much more that s for me to know and for you to find out youll learn as life progresses for now you can go home
4295641 i thought those powers were left in nessasis but obviously i thought wrong it caught me waaaaay off guard
4295642 but wouldnt that mean you have some powers from nessasis as well
4295643 i used rage but nothing special happened except me getting beat
4295644 he fuckin kidnapped rpj and convict and apparently hes out for some kind of revenge
4295645 oh boy thats not good you see theres this comet with these three powerful warriors headed for earth anyday now and thats going to be a problem in and of itself
4295646 but you know what i aint losing to evomark again so everything will be fine
4295647 are you serious youre really gonna be humble about last night
4295648 i honestly havent the slightest idea what i should be humble about
4295649 just get back here right now im ready for round two and this time now that i know how you get it in im sooooooooo ready for ya
4295650 prove that you are ready by accurately describing what i did last night
4295651 it all started with that lap dance that you gave me getting me all hot and bothered i was so hot you decided that you could cool me off by slipping off my shirt
4295652 oh right we smoked that good ass weed first which basically loosened us up and got us into the mood that was pretty shocking cause i thought you dont do drugs
4295653 the situation now had shin evomarks name written all over it
4295654 who you calling al bastard oh wait that must be a part of the game fine yeah
4295655 do yourself a favor tell me where rpj convict and sally are and maybe i wont have to prove that your victory yesterday was the most fucked up fluke ever
4295656 i myself wanna know if my victory from yesterday was a fluke the best way to do that force your anger bring you to a new level i wanna see you at your best or rather your worst
4295657 kinda like the time you killed evomark jr you thought that was a game right
4295658 oh i got your games right here right now rrrrrraaaaaaggggggeeeeee
4295659 lets see if red eyes marko man has what it takes to get his friends back you win you get your friends and you do what you want to me lose and the torment continues
4295660 youll fall asleep youll lose the fight and i can add your little friend sally to my collection and as far as what i did to her and what exactly happened ill leave that your your imagination
4295661 im quite convinced that ive fianlly got his number the only thing to do now is push him to max to make his demise convincing and true and i know exactly how im going to do it
4295662 theyre here the wickeds of the comet landed in central park i know youre not in a good mood but you and your brothers are the only team close enough and together enough to handle this you gotta stop them
4295663 mom were going to the city gotta save the world and whatnot
4295664 im kife this strong dude here is powhurtz and the one who looks like hes angry at the universe is orcen considering that you dont seem scared and you fit the description that weve heard you must be marko man
4295665 were not leaving until we turn this planet into a comet
4295666 were turning useless planets into comets and when were with the useless planets we will rule the rest of the universe and guess what earth qualifies as a useless planet
4295667 you realize that theres no way you can take all three of us on right
4295668 oh this should be easy i got the little one
4295669 youve got some nerve showing your face during an intense battle like this and now that markos got in a little warm up im sure hell kick your ass this time
4295670 please he is of no concern to me right now ive just taken your mother because of the opportunity these three aliens gave me and now i need to add you two to my collection
4295671 the new guy that theyre fighting seems to want the other two for his own purposes
4295672 i say we help him take them down so that were left with marko man and we can take him down
4295673 but the guy their fighting while he looks like marko man isnt just a rival hes clearly evil like us
4295674 it doesnt matter because marko man is the biggest threat
4295675 if we take him down then this guy will have to either join us or get taken down next
4295676 but id be careful if i were you marko man is surely about to welcome you to earth the hard way
4295677 i dont care how mad you get at him you still gotta worry about us
4295678 that doesnt make sense how did his power increase like that how does an earthling even have that much power
4295679 it doesnt matter because he will die by our hands
4295680 you sit here and contribute to the kidnaping of my brothers
4295681 and now you fuckin fuckers have the fucking audacity to fuckin power up to fuckin contend against me youre better off committing suicide because this will only have the same result
4295682 what does that make you if you die on a useless planet dead overnight destruction
4295683 shut the fuck up and release them if you enjoy living
4295684 you are in no position to make threats besides you have one choice to make before i kick your ass for the last time
4295685 you killed my son so now its time i evened it up but im a let you make the choice of who i shuold kill you have rpj the convict sally your mother and your two brothers and basiclly you have reasoning to have any one of them killed you can have rpj killed because you know hes the hero closest to taking your spotlight and his death will ensure your top spot wont it you can have the convict killed because even though he plays a hero you cant really trust a convict can you you can have sally killed because you know how you feel about her and maybe he death can you know eventually make you feel better about it in some sick twisted shin marko man esque way your brothers killed because of the way they get on your nerves or finally you can have your mother killed so that you can finally be the free spirit you want to be its your choice make it or ill make it for you
4295686 all of the choices you have prsent me with are very very tempting
4295687 after a little thought i have decided that you are absolutely right at the end of the day you truly can not trust a convict so kill the convict
4295688 exactly how i wanted you to feel before i take this momentum that ive gained and finally take you out for good
4295689 oh boy you let those two victories go to you head all of out other fights mean nothing fine you shoulda killed me when you had the chance but go ahead take meout i dare you
4295690 but my victories against you have proven that i can beat you and as i can now feel that this is the point where the fight gets serious along with that fact that ive beaten you once and ive beaten you twice theres nothing stopping me from beating you a thrid and final time
4295691 its time for me to do what no villain has done its time for me to kill your ass
4295692 oh wait since when do i give a fuck about what you want
4295693 i cannot let you win ive come too far to allow you to win im sorry but i wont let it happen rejuvination
4295694 it doesnt even matter you have been beaten that means you can be beaten next time we meet you will be beaten
4295695 but he escaped at least you guys are officially saved
4295696 what matters is that you won now were safe and we can go home

4295781 the rowers are in for quite a few chances of winning but when racing comes at the olympics it really is difficult to consistently come up with your good results
4295782 the olympics put a lot of pressure on you and people have got to be aware of that
4295783 im just hoping they do all strike it lucky and get the first couple of races under way and get a good roll on it then if the first couple start winning you never know what happens
4295784 i got the first one under way and once that happened i knew there was nothing going to stop me i knew i was the best and the whole team sort of got in that same vibe and we just suddenly felt invincible

4295787 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4295788 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4295789 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4295790 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4295791 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4295811 orang orang yang terlibat ada yang diberi sanksi pidana karena dianggap merugikan negara dengan cara menghindari pembayaran cukai
4295812 penutupan itu sendiri wajar munculnya pabrikan itu disebabkan ketidaktahuan produsen tentang rokok yang setiap batangnya dikenakan cukai

4295833 certainly one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4295834 called me just 20 minutes before the bronze competition begging me to compete
4295835 i decided that i had come this far and didnt want to let them down so i wrestled
4295836 im going to play quarterback exactly how they want me to play quarterback im going to make the reads coach martz wants me to make
4295837 im going to turn the ball loose and on time im going to trust everyone to do their job and theyre going to trust me to do my job i dont go into it thinking im going to play this sort of tentative game
4295838 ive talked to coach nolan a lot this week and i think its a difficult situation just with what happened i think maybe he was looking to i dont know maybe this could have been a different week but obviously with this going on it kind of puts things in perspective for me a little bit
4295839 ill come back and treat it the way i always have just focus in and take advantage of the reps i get and try to make the most out of them its kind of all i can do
4295840 you know it was a long time ago lets not go there now because it would be a lot of b s
4295841 from the outside looking in if it didnt work out somewhere my attitude was i just wasnt good enough to make that team he said
4295842 i went through hell that night i would never wish this on anyone but with your sentencing i hope your hell has just begun
4295843 her freedom was taken that night and terror was inflicted upon her for no other reason than that she had money
4295844 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind
4295845 the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections
4295846 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
4295847 if i didnt see anyone heavier than me i felt bad
4295848 if i did i felt relieved and then i felt really shallow
4295849 i always knew it was a possibility for me my pediatrician told my mom when i was a child that given our family history it was more than likely that at least one of her four children would develop diabetes
4295850 i always felt that i would take care of myself and never allow myself to develop type 2
4295851 life happened and three years ago i found myself at the thresholds of diabetes
4295852 i started seeing all my bad habits come home to roost and i knew that i was really at risk for having my life shortened
4295853 if it had been i would have started filling out the paperwork because i didnt think i could lose weight on my own
4295854 i work for a hospital and johns hopkins has such a great reputation
4295855 i read the success stories and i told my husband i just wanted to try it for four weeks
4295856 ive been on every diet you can name and this is not only the only one that ever worked it is also the easiest i ever went on
4295857 it made everything that happened over this past year the food i couldnt eat while i was on the plan it made it all worthwhile i couldnt think of a slice of pizza or a brownie that was worth anything like hearing my doctor say those words
4295858 theyre losing weight and most of them have had their insulin cut in half
4295859 its been really exciting for me to see not only the weight loss and turnaround in my own health but to see that repeated in the lives of other people im working with
4295860 he saw me sticking to it and did everything he could to support me
4295861 he would eat the lean protein and the vegetable with me for dinner
4295862 between my husband and me we joke that theres 184 pounds less weight on our mattress
4295863 she went from feeling like this was just how it was going to be to being very hopeful shes optimistic that once she reaches her goal weight she might not need any insulin at all
4295864 if i didnt see anyone heavier than me i felt bad
4295865 if i did i felt relieved and then i felt really shallow
4295866 four years ago i went to cozumel and just walked around and shopped and i felt exhausted
4295867 i did all this stuff this time and got back to the ship did dinner saw a show and went to a karaoke bar
4295868 but i was dancing and i looked great im so much less self conscious i just want to go out there and do things and have fun
4295869 i made the decision to stay on the plan so there was a lot of emotional and spiritual growth that happened
4295870 i understand now that food is incapable of providing comfort
4295871 my big takeaway message is that its never too late to turn things around its never too late to make positive changes in your health
4295872 it doesnt matter if youre in your fifties sixties or seventies if youve just received a diagnosis of diabetes or if youve been on insulin for decades its possible to make positive choices that will change your health what youre dealing with now is not inevitable
4295873 so ray using your 30 years of in depth research into the evidence for evolution please inform the class why tiktaalik doesnt count as a transitional form youve been given an example now before you make another post repeating your claim that there are absolutely no transitional fossils please deal with this one

4295880 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4295881 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4295882 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4295883 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4295884 the ever spawning breed of hackers and malevolent wrongdoers within the various realms of cyberspace have mutated to produce a new and more politically charged offspring the hacktivist
4295885 imagine writing for an instrumentation of two electric guitars two tubas french horn drums and henry threadgills alto threadgill was up to the challenge and his four avant garde originals utilize the odd combination of tones to great advantage two additional songs feature threadgill just one tuba drums a few exotic instruments and three strings to create some particularly unusual music its for the open eared listener only

4295887 potential partners who seem undiscriminating are a definite turnoff and those who evoke the magic of feeling special are a big draw
4295888 the wild part is that our speed daters were negotiating all of these subtleties with only four minutes for each date
4295889 selective vs unselective romantic desire not all reciprocity is created equal
4295890 im sorry but i just have so much to do today reading papers doing experiments saving the world the usual i could pencil you in in two weeks

4295892 im sorry but i just have so much to do today reading papers doing experiments saving the world the usual i could pencil you in in two weeks
4295893 i always knew that harrys story would end with the seventh book but saying goodbye has been just as hard as i always knew it would be

4295895 a breast feeding mother is perfectly acceptable on an aircraft providing she is feeding the child in a discreet way
4295896 she was asked to use a blanket just to provide a little more discretion she was given a blanket and she refused to use it and thats all i know
4295897 expanding nato would be the most fateful error of american policy in the entire post cold war era
4295898 god is necessary for order and morality who cares which god so long as it is not too far from the judeo christian model who even cares if god exists just as long as we talk about god as though he does
4295899 id rather be a hammer than a nail yes i would if i only could i surely would
4295900 our understanding is that dan drew his weapon and confronted the gunman

4295903 spent most of her time in church praying for him to snap out of his unhealthy taciturnity
4295904 her spare time was devoted to the korean church in centreville where she implored the pastor to help her son according to the joong ang daily she always prayed that her boy could become more outgoing
4295905 its harder to hit a moving target i will probably be shot anyway and maybe i can just take this guy down or distract him enough for someone else to do so
4295906 in one ear and out the other dont you get criss crossed i recommend you try a little mental floss
4295907 hey this kids really weird he kinda freaks me out

4295915 our agenda for action says we recognize that people are struggling
4295916 theyre struggling to pay property taxes they want to see a balanced budget they want a jobs bill they want roads to be safe they want bigger roads and wider roads so they can get to work
4295917 its issues that we think we can carry to the people of the state and make a difference
4295918 the mismanagement thats gone on here in illinois with governor blagojevich its just totally not acceptable
4295919 as bad ratings as he has approval ratings in this state as the governor has so should speaker mike madigan and emil jones
4295920 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
4295921 beijing is so over its all about the tranny olympics
4295922 its one of those opportunities where girls and guys can dress up together
4295923 sensation as you know is the tyranny of los angeles
4295924 other areas may have had water but didnt have the vegetation density that is required
4295925 we are now waiting on the government and licence to come through
4295926 if we dont get it by early next week we would have to look a doing the relocation in around march next year instead
4295927 there are now initial discussions being held with surrounding land owners to see if there are any concerns or problems they forsee with the relocation and we will try to make sure these are overcome
4295928 we had a couple of wet winters in a row and we had serious problems with our roads
4295929 it wasnt just singleton that was facing this problem though and some councils were in such trouble that they were turning their sealed roads back to gravel
4295930 my philosophy is every time you spend a dollar think that it is coming out of your own pocket
4295931 i enjoyed the challenge of doing the best i could with what i had
4295932 thats why i am in favour of rate pegging as if councils had unlimited funds im sure they would be wasted
4295933 i think when people take on a job with council they should adopt singleton as their town
4295934 i think it is important to be accessible to the towns residents and have the town at heart when making decisions
4295935 id like to thank everyone ive worked with and dealt with in the community over the years
4295936 the issue is confusing and needs further clarification and given that council is in a partnership with the developer that makes the need for transparency and accountability even greater
4295937 council has a moral and ethical obligation to determine in the context of the bigger picture what effect the development will have whats the big rush
4295938 we are thrilled with these achievements and the eating quality award shows us that our breed is suitable for the table
4295939 entries were very strong and this competition is the top event for farmers across the eastern states
4295940 they place up to eighth because to get into the top ten is considered quite exceptional
4295941 the justice league of america just had an opening and we thought of you
4295942 stop it this makes me sick this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
4295943 esses tr s elementos foram abordados e com eles foi encontrado um rev lver calibre 38 com numera o raspada eles acabaram confessando que estavam ali naquela localidade exatamente para roubar essa mulher
4295944 n s temos quase certeza de que outros comparsas desses homens estavam no interior da ag ncia vigiando os passos dessa mulher que eles iriam assaltar infelizmente eles n o foram encontrados mas tr s deles acabaram presos
4295945 o consumidor deve pegar a nota fiscal do abastecimento se o carro apresentar algum problema ele pode retornar ao posto e pedir ao propriet rio que fa a o teste da qualidade do produto
4295946 are you sure you have tested an actually i do have a fee only advisor lined up as well as a cpa and estate planning attorney should this actually finally end
4295947 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4295948 it is a diverse group of candidates which is good as we need different points of view on various issues
4295949 i also think it is a reflection on the good work that council is doing
4295950 all the candidates that i have spoken to have said they want to continue to take singleton forward and work for its betterment

4296034 we can do a query and put the model number the brand name serial number and if its pawned anywhere thats a leads online participant it will come back and say who pawned it where it was pawned from and well be able to recover that merchandise
4296035 on the new system we just want it in there that if there is a serial number a model number available that it be posted
4296036 i think its just a way to make things harder for us instead of the law helping us
4296037 because not everything serial numbers and if theyre getting picky now its going to get more picky later
4296038 im going to write my self help book and call it stupid men and the hot smart and otherwise fantastic women who love them
4296039 my position was that we are a magazine not a court of law and if it quacks like a duck
4296040 you often wonder what somebody is thinking but that would be the furthest thing from my mind that anything of that nature would come out of him
4296041 then someone came over i guess it was the fbi or investigators and were asking me questions then i asked them questions and they indicated what was what he was involved in little rock
4296042 i definitely feel for all involved its such a tragedy he comes from a fine family its sad as far as mr gwatney that he killed there is no rhyme or reason to it its upsetting
4296043 chinas position on the tibetan issue is consistent and clear
4296044 we hope france will pay attention to chinas concerns and carefully handle the related important and sensitive issue
4296045 france should make efforts with china to avoid any disturbances that could arise and ensure the healthy and stable development of sino french relations
4296046 a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another if these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden but if these minds get out of harmony with one another it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden
4296047 el primer logro del movimiento para el pueblo fue que el gobierno profacista tuvo que dar marcha atr s a su consigna de prohibir los plantones y movilizaciones de quienes se sienten agraviados en sus leg timos derechos con los 26 muertos encarcelados y desaparecidos se han pagado estas libertades otra lecci n fue para el mismo gobierno que entre sus esquemas no supo hallar una soluci n al conflicto aprendi que el descontento social no se puede acallar con la represi n
4296048 no pod a llegar a ning n acuerdo porque estaban radicalizando el movimiento
4296049 el estallido social se da cuando el gobierno de ulises ru z no supo contener los agravios de muchos a os la injusticia la represi n caciquil del pri los abusos la corrupci n tampoco quiso actuar contra los grupos nbsp que controlan el poder pol tico y econ mico de los municipios en vez de mediar con estos clanes que lastimaban al pueblo se vuelve parte de ellos y no solo empeora la situaci n sino que entra a formar parte de esos conflictos con esa actitud el r gimen no solo abon la desigualdad sino al mismo conflicto que estaba a punto de estallar impone autoridades y destruye el trabajo comunitario en forma escandalosa despilfarra los recursos p blicos para las campa as de los candidatos pri stas
4296050 la expresi n m s clara del r gimen ulicista ha sido reprimir a quienes no est n de acuerdo con nbsp su manera de gobernar nbsp controlar todos los aspectos de la vida comunitaria los medios de comunicaci n y los partidos pol ticos tambi n a la iglesia rest ndole poder a trav s de robos sacr legos todos estos hechos pueden considerarse como el principio de un gobierno fascista es una democracia imperfecta con rostro de fascismo que utiliza el conflicto de nbsp oaxaca para legitimarse con la federaci n y seguir negociando impunidades son las pol ticas que sobreviven de estas complicidades y de la descomposici n que permea por todo el pa s y de las que oaxaca es el mejor reflejo todo lo anterior origina que nadie crea tampoco en las instituciones de justicia todo mundo ve la complicidad entre las fuerzas del orden y las organizaciones criminales
4296051 situaci n actual de oaxaca no puede haber ni existir un estado de derecho cuando el propio estado no cumple sus atribuciones y en tales condiciones tampoco puede exigir al pueblo cumplir con sus obligaciones cuando el gobierno garantice todos los derechos de la poblaci n podr exigir el cumplimiento de obligaciones pero violando las garant as de la gente y cancelando todas sus libertades para legitimarse significar a que estamos bajo un r gimen tirano en esta sociedad en que se violan todos los derechos fundamentales nbsp en vez de existir un estado de derecho deber amos estar hablando de un estado de corte fascista
4296052 dentro de este maremagnum de violaciones algunas organizaciones de la asamblea popular quieren cambiar este gobierno desde adentro de este sistema descompuesto
4296053 as tambi n nadie quiere creer que la resistencia del pueblo es ilimitada sin fronteras se equivocan quienes piensan que el pueblo se ha cansado de luchar porque despu s de 500 a os de resistencia ha desarrollado mil formas de para enfrentar a sus opresores por lo pronto el pueblo ha recobrado su derecho de manifestarse pero esto no ha sido gratuito sino el resultado de la lucha revolucionaria donde murieron millones de mexicanos
4296054 han entendido que en el ma ana la victoria ser de quienes tienen la libertad de expresar y decir lo que piensan la victoria del pueblo vendr y ser conjuntamente con todos aquellos que le dieron la voz
4296055 bueno sabemos que en la construcci n de una nueva sociedad es necesaria la relaci n entre los servidores p blicos y los ciudadanos que tenemos por delante un largo proceso para que la gente participe y se organice para que las d diva y las migajas del sistema no sean condici n de sometimiento
4296056 la conciencia social tiene que construirse tiene que haber otra alternativa que no precisamente tenga que ser dentro del mismo poder del estado esto obliga a las organizaciones sociales a creer que es posible un nuevo proyecto a trav s de una alianza la cual se funda este 10 de agosto en la ciudad de oaxaca la que podr a fundirse con otras organizaciones pol ticas democr ticas del pa s con la experiencia del movimiento oaxaque o
4296057 todos los gobiernos utilizan a los grupos armados como estrategia para reprimir los movimientos sociales y a sus dirigentes
4296058 fue por la movilizaci n por la libertad de nuestros compa eros y otros actos represivos del gobierno de oaxaca que hicimos en la ciudad de m xico ante la secretar a de gobernaci n y la cndh acord ndose una mesa de trabajo para solucionar el caso de xanica el 3 de febrero de 2005 pero una hora antes de la cita con el gobernador en presencia de tres visitadores de la cndh entre ellos fernando mendoza y jes s bustos fuimos detenidos instruy ndosenos procesos por robo con violencia robo simple secuestro ataques a las v as de comunicaci n por cierto cuando jaquelina fue detenida los agentes policiales golpearon a los visitadores de la cndh
4296059 felipe calder n tiene todas las pruebas de la administraci n ulicista con las que puede presionar y obligar a que se le entregue al pan la gubernatura del estado a cambio de impunidad
4296060 c mo perder a el pri la gubernatura de oaxaca imponiendo a un candidato repudiado por el pueblo y por las mismas bases pri stas pero lo que s es cierto es que oaxaca ya no puede seguir siendo negociada a cambio de complicidades e impunidad ya no debe haber negociaci n principalmente la impunidad de sus gobernantes

4296068 the current global food crisis requires immediate action to feed people most at risk said sylvia mathews burwell president of the foundations global development program in the longer term since agriculture and the needs of small scale farmers in the developing world have been increasingly neglected in recent decades we need a significant reinvestment in agricultural development from donors and developing countries that focuses on helping small farmers boost their yields and increase their incomes

4296104 the people were unfriendly awkward out of style their kids wouldnt talk to my kids the pews were uncomfortable i didnt know the songs people kept violating my personal space everybody wanted to shake my hand the guy in front of me kept moving his head the kid behind made all kind of noise the preacher thinks he knows it all and he was too loud too quiet too long too preachy

4296118 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4296119 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4296120 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4296121 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4296122 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4296123 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4296124 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4296126 the eggs were white but collapsed in and there was a little discoloration on the eggshell a signal theyre not viable
4296127 with so few eggs in this leatherback nest i was dubious about their fertility and survival from the outset
4296128 however it was very good that they were fertile perhaps this same female or others will come here to nest here in the future

4296132 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society there is no issue that does not lend itself to dialogue and reconciliation
4296133 calm be always maintained in all parts of the country and wherever differences exist all efforts be directed towards reconciliation
4296134 i am confident that the concept of india that is functioning in unison in a milieu of a vast diversity will continue to define our identity
4296135 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to the strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4296136 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades
4296137 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4296138 often we are vocal about our rights but we tend to focus less on our numerous duties we have duties towards the country society and family of which we can ignore none we must remember that while discharging our duties we have an obligation to act responsibly
4296139 no one should be left behind as the nation progresses it is my wish that growth and prosperity reaches every state every district every city every town every village and every individual of the country we have attained impressive rates of growth but empowerment of all sections of society still remains unaccomplished
4296140 people and organisations who work tirelessly without expectation of rewards unseen and maybe unsung constitute the foundation of a nation and give it inherent strength
4296141 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4296142 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4296143 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4296144 paganism is as old as human history in one sentence paganism is a culture of untruth

4296155 i saw the unsigned lyrics and liked them because they speak about the defenders who eagerly safeguarded the homeland
4296156 if jezerinac pursues with attitudes like that he faces a ban on entering army barracks
4296157 how dare you you were not like this you changed on me
4296158 so if i do not like how my partner talks behaves treats me etc i should just let them go
4296159 fill in name i love you but i cannot be with you under these circumstances i am okay if you need to pursue this blank action behavior attitude but i cannot be a part of it as it is not the experience i choose
4296160 why you want to be with a person who is really not them self
4296161 new growth continually sprouts from the soil of my spiritual garden
4296162 gracious gardener i trust that you will continually water my soul and drench my life with your abiding love
4296163 well this works in their favor so i am just supposed to forget what they did or said to me
4296164 of course not as it is only then that i dont have to worry about the house kids spouse bills etc
4296165 there are so many beautiful things taking place in the world today
4296166 can you imagine what life would be like if everybody felt that way
4296167 i had a bit of back niggle this week and havent been able to do much in pool but i was feeling really good today
4296168 the plan was to go out hard and hold on
4296169 a pb personal best and a big pb in a heat i couldnt ask for more than that it was an awesome swim and i felt great
4296170 ive been training really well and done a lot of hard work and thats paying off another pb would in the semifinals would be fantastic and if thats enough to get me into the final thatd be great
4296171 i ended up forcing it way too much instead of using the water i fought the water it could have been a lot better than it was
4296172 it was pretty tough yesterday there were a few ups and downs but i should have been capable of making the semis its not good
4296173 there you can make a decent model anywhere though so i wouldnt start trumpeting the authenticity of this thing until some reputable scientists get a chance to look at it at the earliest
4296174 when he came up here i told him it was probably for a short period of time
4296175 its a shame he had his first outing yesterday it wasnt real good but it was his first outing
4296176 the nfl has a lot of glitz and that works
4296177 would i pay 255 to see the argos not likely
4296178 it was a lot of fun and i felt very good
4296179 i felt strong didnt have any pain but well see how i feel tomorrow and go from there
4296180 getting on the field even at three in the afternoon was a blast
4296181 i was swinging a bat which is what i do its what ive always done i cant remember going so long without hitting
4296182 one year when i was in the minors i started getting ready for spring training on nov 1
4296183 took into account the work that the club undertook before and during the match
4296184 as fff president i ask myself how to fight against this plague if i dont have the support of the justice system of my own country
4296185 ive still got 100 million worth of property in the lichfield st area it just happens that my vision and passion for inner city rejuvenation dovetails with the planners in the city
4296186 ive fielded strong interest from big box retailers for the sydenham square site
4296187 and the values the city bought the properties for was below my valuations of march of this year the market isnt as dead as some want to make out
4296188 i think most of it is hysteria whipped up by the media theres no seriously intellectual discussion in three months it will be forgotten and ill be a whipping boy for something else
4296189 it is not a happy deal for me other than the opportunity for the vision for a classic mixed use urban neighbourhood survives beyond that i have taken a big hit on all these properties
4296190 the notion that this is some bailout is childish and out of step with the economic realities neither former mayor garry moore nor current mayor bob parker approached me
4296191 i still have my concerns about the turners amp growers site and the way that was handled a stalled development sold by council to wellington developers three years ago that influenced my discussions here and my insistence on how this deal had to be structured if we were to do it
4296192 my ideological position remains unchanged but im happy to have a robust debate about it the council made me an offer two of the properties they offered on were for sale but the other wasnt in the end after discussion and consideration i accepted
4296193 i sell them land and buy land from them it doesnt mean i agree with everything they do or even their authority but the reality of doing developments anywhere requires that i have council as a tenant and i have had the state as a tenant
4296194 this deal does not help me recover my position as you suggest my position being recovered to how it was say a year ago takes a number of deals happening all greater than this one
4296195 what you seem to be suggesting is that i should not have accepted an offer from the council but rather sold to some other third party who in turn would have been free to sell to the council
4296196 as you know ca is a very big company weve been in the specific area of anti malware software for more than 12 years
4296197 but this marketplace is very dynamic so for the first time in our history about seven months ago we created a dedicated group called the internet security business unit
4296198 ive been in the channels for all my 26 year ca career ive run the channel in europe and in the us and now im running the isbu
4296199 on july 9 we launched the isbu partner programme plenty of our competitors have partner programmes and weve studied them all we even spent 300 000 on researching what theyre doing the programme weve built is quite different and has cost us several millions to set up and weve launched it simultaneously in new zealand australia and the us which is a commitment to this marketplace unlike any other in the industry
4296200 we wanted to make it as easy as possible for partners to access the products so we provide company wide access to relevant information other companies insist on issuing accounts access one employee at a time but we want our partners to have immediate access we provide training and certification in many languages cuts up into easily digested interactive chunks we widely distribute not for resale nfr copies of the software which we deliver on usb cards
4296201 no one wants these properties theyre not strategic they have all been passed over by the private sector theyve been on the market for ages
4296202 were funding developments we dont need or want i dont now if its stupidity or corruption it seems to be a repeat of the turners amp growers sale to wellington developers under former mayor garry moore but nothings happened on that site in four years
4296203 war is too important to be left to politicians they have neither the time the training nor the inclination for strategic thought i can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration communist indoctrination communist subversion and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids
4296204 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4296205 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4296206 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4296207 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4296208 university of reading scientists have developed a robot controlled by a biological brain formed from cultured neurons and this is a worlds premiere other research teams have tried to control robots with brains but there was always a computer in the loop this new project is the first one to examine how memories manifest themselves in the brain and how a brain stores specific pieces of data as life expectancy is increasing in most countries this new research could provide insights into how the brain works and help aging people in fact the main goal of this project is to understand better the development of diseases and disorders which affect the brain such as alzheimer or parkinson diseases its interesting to note that this project is being led by professor kevin warwick who became famous in 1998 when a silicon chip was implanted in his arm to allow a computer to monitor him in order to assess the latest technology for use with the disabled
4296209 every day they ask us for explanation in our daily dialogue with them
4296210 the icrc wants to continue to have the confidence of all sides in the conflict

4296225 smoking is like breathing in exhaust fumes so of course it is going to affect a mother and foetus but there are people who tell you their baby was fine even though they smoked throughout the pregnancy i would say perhaps the placenta didnt implant as well as it could have or vessel growth wasnt as optimal as it could have been if they had been non smokers

4296438 the greatest impact the web may have on this election is fostering a return to old fashioned politics remember the old block captains of yesteryear who would literally go door to door in their neighborhoods stumping for candidates and dragging reluctant voters to the polls the internet is the most powerful word of mouth tool ever

4296454 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4296455 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
4296456 given the recent nature of the cats death and where it was found it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat
4296457 we are keen to speak with anyone who may have been in contact with either of the two victims in the days before their death
4296458 we are currently checking mobile phone records in order to tie down times of death and it would be of assistance to us if those people who spoke to them could contact us

4296492 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
4296493 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
4296494 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
4296495 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline

4296502 we hope that this new field research the first definitive crash causation study to be done in the united states in almost 30 years will shed new light on the causes of crashes on our nations highways knowledge gained from this study may help all of us concerned with rider safety to develop even more effective countermeasures to enhance the safety of motorcyclists everywhere but we wont know until the study which will be a long and thorough process has been conducted for the safety of motorcyclists we need this federal study to be of high priority and move forward as soon as possible
4296503 the overwhelming number of motorcyclists who wind up in single vehicle crash statistics are there because they arent following basic but important safety precautions when riding
4296504 and fewer than half of all riders have taken any kind of formal training course we also know that car drivers and other motorists are at fault a majority of the time in multiple vehicle crashes that involve a motorcyclist we have life saving messages for everyone whether they are behind the handlebars or behind a steering wheel
4296505 all of these are all doable real world actions that will cut down crashes and fatalities right now
4296506 above everything else its about the human element the attitude the mind set that motorcyclists and motorists have and the choices they make out there on the road
4296507 we need more understanding of human nature because the only real danger that exists is man himself we know nothing of man far too little his psyche should be studied because we are the origin of all coming evil
4296508 any military commander who is honest with himself or with those hes speaking to will admit that he has made mistakes in the application of military power hes killed people unnecessarily his own troops or other troops through mistakes through errors of judgment a hundred or thousands or tens of thousands maybe even a hundred thousand but he hasnt destroyed nations
4296509 i want to say and this is very important at the end we lucked out it was luck that prevented nuclear war
4296510 i took more philosophy classes particularly one in logic and one in ethics stress on values and something beyond ones self and a responsibility to society
4296511 in that single night we burned to death 100 000 japanese civilians in tokyo men women and children
4296512 i n order to win a war should you kill 100 000 people in one night by firebombing or any other way lemays answer would be clearly yes proportionality should be a guideline in war killing 50 to 90 of the people of 67 japanese cities and then bombing them with two nuclear bombs is not proportional in the minds of some people to the objectives we were trying to achieve
4296513 i was present with the president when together we received information of that coup ive never seen him more upset he totally blanched president kennedy and i had tremendous problems with diem but my god he was the authority he was the head of state and he was overthrown by a military coup and kennedy knew and i knew that to some degree the u s government was responsible for that
4296514 we spent ten hours that day trying to find out what in the hell had happened at one point the commander of the ship said were not certain of the attack at another point they said yes were absolutely positive and then finally late in the day admiral sharp said yes were certain it happened so i reported this to johnson and as a result there were bombing attacks on targets in north vietnam johnson said we may have to escalate and im not going to do it without congressional authority and he put forward a resolution the language of which gave complete authority to the president to take the nation to war the tonkin gulf resolution
4296515 were those who issued the approval to use agent orange criminals were they committing a crime against humanity lets look at the law now what kind of law do we have that says these chemicals are acceptable for use in war and these chemicals are not we dont have clear definitions of that kind i never in the world would have authorized an illegal action im not really sure i authorized agent orange i dont remember it but it certainly occurred the use of it occurred while i was secretary
4296516 how much evil must we do in order to do good we have certain ideals certain responsibilities recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil but minimize it
4296517 one of the lessons i learned early on never say never never never never never say never and secondly never answer the question that is asked of you answer the question that you wish had been asked of you and quite frankly i follow that rule its a very good rule
4296518 we all make mistakes we know we make mistakes i dont know any military commander who is honest who would say he has not made a mistake theres a wonderful phrase the fog of war what the fog of war means is war is so complex its beyond the ability of the human mind to comprehend all the variables our judgment our understanding are not adequate and we kill people unnecessarily
4296519 in 1968 the year i wrote slaughterhouse five i finally became grown up enough to write about the bombing of dresden it was the largest massacre in european history i of course know about auschwitz but a massacre is something that happens suddenly the killing of a whole lot of people in a very short time in dresden on february 13 1945 about 135 000 people were killed by british firebombing in one night it was pure nonsense pointless destruction the whole city was burned down and it was a british atrocity not ours they sent in night bombers and they came in and set the whole town on fire with a new kind of incendiary bomb and so everything organic except my little pow group was consumed by fire it was a military experiment to find out if you could burn down a whole city by scattering incendiaries over it

4296522 the beauty of anglicanism is that we are not a church that believes god stopped revealing himself at the end of the first century when the canon of scripture was closed
4296523 god did not reveal everything about himself with the end of the life of jesus but promised that the holy spirit would lead us all into the truth
4296524 i realized with my last pair to go oh the olympic record is only 144
4296525 if you shoot the olympic record in qualification rounds and youve got a little bit of a lead you expect to come out with gold
4296526 but after i went out there in the final and missed that first pair it was a little dicey there for a second but i brought it all back together
4296527 i finally made a final in the olympics i came in like 12th in sydney and 17th in athens and finally came out and put a good day together this was the only thing i was worried about for the last two years
4296528 that and i had my teammates with me the military has been great to me theyve helped me fulfill a dream that without them i dont think wouldve ever happened i owe everything to them
4296529 it gave me a lot of discipline i was fortunate enough to go into the
4296530 for right now they asked me to come to the olympics and win a gold medal for the united states
4296531 i dont know how to better represent them than with a gold medal in my hand
4296532 theyve been here all week and to the last two olympics watching me to have them here and to finally win a gold medal for them is incredible the crowd was amazing the facilities were incredible
4296533 this game is all about putting four good rounds together and honestly i could only manage two i had a mediocre round and a bad round so when youve got two good rounds they dont offset the mediocre and bad rounds
4296534 thats where you finish when you shoot like i did in the final
4296535 glenn eller and i started shooting against each other a long long time ago and we actually enlisted in the army together in the fall of 2006 this was half of our goal we wanted gold and silver at the olympics we came really close but im happy for him
4296536 when were out on the shooting line we take the gloves off and go at it as hard as anybody else
4296537 i dont feel bad when he misses a target if he would have lost the gold medal yeah i would have felt badly for him but not if i was in the silver medal position id be chasing him the whole way
4296538 joining the army was probably the best thing i couldve done for my shooting career just because of the discipline and structure that comes along with the army
4296539 the army marksmanship unit at fort benning has world class shooting facilities we shoot with and against some of the best in the world
4296540 ive been training with the 2008 olympic gold medalist for the last two years straight since i joined the army so the
4296541 my heartfelt thanks go out to everybody who has been behind me this whole time but its glenns day
4296542 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4296543 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4296544 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4296545 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedexcup
4296546 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4296547 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150 for a player of my current status those are the real concerns
4296548 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4296549 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4296550 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4296551 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4296552 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4296553 cults seeking to introduce christ to the romanian people as if they havent known him for almost two millennia
4296554 it should be reconstructed to remember those times and show bosnians and the world how we lived how we survived
4296555 if the city rebuilds it it would become the premier tourist destination in the city
4296556 even i wouldnt come here if this wasnt my house
4296557 it could be a joint venture with a foreign firm
4296558 twenty five meters is not enough for people to remember how we suffered in the war
4296559 if people think about the past we couldnt have wars

4296563 i think we can do more and we should do more
4296564 these results are going to move their country forward and we have to learn how better to provide support for our athletes
4296565 we have to have a good hard look at how we fund our athletes our coaches our nutritionists lets get on with doing something its critical
4296566 who knows how many youngsters will start swimming because of michael phelps or 2007 world champion from b c brent hayden
4296567 yes you need to fund the foundation and you need to build from the ground up but you need to fund worthwhile elite athletes as well we have to invest in the athlete
4296568 but we can do more to help them attain their absolute best
4296569 i wasnt that good at any of them but i played
4296570 were coming up on the back half of the games

4296597 there are certain associates and vps which are extremely difficult and painful to work for this is obviously something that cannot be eliminated but should be mitigated wherever possible
4296598 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4296599 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4296600 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4296601 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4296602 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4296603 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4296604 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4296605 if intellectual property had a theme song it would have to be like a virgin

4296630 the departments been focusing on targeting gang hierarchies which have been dismantled over an extended period of time
4296631 thats causing gangs to now operate in smaller crews that compete against each other for narcotic turf which leads to deadly violence
4296632 bond said the department is working on developing gang fighting strategies to try to dismantle the smaller younger and more fractionalized gangs
4296633 law enforcement is having to adapt to that and looking at different kinds of ways that are outside the traditional ways that weve been using to attack gang violence

4296635 as their great father in washington had heard that they wished to sell their land he had sent commissioners to meet with them

4296640 both presidents roosevelt were great leaders who looked shrewdly into the future to solve key environmental and energy problems tr of course was the father of the united states forest service and oversaw a slew of environmental back then the popular term was conservation initiatives he also worked to sustain a healthier population with bold efforts to improve working conditions and to upgrade the safety of food and medicine and three decades later fdr tackled energy issues he initiated a vast program of energy producing public works including the tennessee valley authority in addition he started up the rural electrification administration which helped assure an equitable distribution of electricity across the u s a those are both great precedents so why should i choose between them
4296641 both tr and fdr saw that this great country would face huge challenges overseas and so it would have to be ready militarily and economically teddy built the great white fleet and sent it steaming around the world in 1907 9 those battleships surely proved valuable in the world war to come and as for franklin after albert einstein wrote to him on august 2 1939 he put in motion the manhattan project which built the a bomb einsteins prescient letter outlining the enormous potential of nuclear fission was written a month before hitler invaded poland and more than two years before pearl harbor but during the course of the war the commander in chief saw the importance of atomic power even as he mobilized the entire nation for conventional weapons production from jeeps to bombers to aircraft carriers fdrs efforts saved america and they saved the world
4296642 and so once again how could i possibly choose between these two great predecessors i want to draw upon their joint legacy all americans should be proud of both of them
4296643 im always ready to help in any way i can ive committed myself to be a public servant
4296644 id take his call now and id take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
4296645 more energy and cheaper energy in return for cleaner energy much cleaner energy
4296646 you cant solve this problem just with conservation and you cant solve it just with production you need both but you need a robust both a vital center both not a mushy both on these issues its unacceptable to have nothing happen because the extremes on both sides block everything and then call that sort of paralysis a compromise thats not compromise thats defeat we need to do better cleaner smarter
4296647 and i think the stakes now are higher even than that this isnt just about jobs and the environment here at home this is about the world balance of power the iranians and the russians and the venezuelans badly behaved as they are have received in effect enormous pay raises because of our collective gluttony for imported oil how can we convince ahmadinejad or putin or chavez that they are on a wrong course when all they see is that their oil and natural gas revenues have tripled in the last couple years
4296648 i want to change that i have been reading a book from a decade or so ago by peter schweizer victory the reagan administrations secret strategy that hastened the collapse of the soviet union and it details how reagan and his team figured out how in effect to economically blockade the soviets driving down oil prices from 40 a barrel when reagan took office to as low as 10 a barrel can you imagine what would happen to russia and iran and venezuela if oil prices fell back down to those levels and what would happen to al qaeda if its wahabi paymasters all went broke
4296649 arnold i dont want you to come here and be merely bureaucrat here for a couple of years and then being run out of town i want you to be a transformative leader able to tap into all the talent and wealth and patriotism that this country has to offer so that we can really do the things i was elected to do here at home provide good jobs at good wages plus health care as well as clean up the environment and regain the upper hand in our international dealings i see all these things as connected and i see you arnold as the key to making all this work
4296650 sir i could never turn you down and i could never turn america down we have a lot of details to work out so that the energy and environment czar can truly be effective but i am confident that working with congress we can get this done
4296651 we have a lot of money in this country what we dont have enough of is security and sustainability happily we can buy that
4296652 i have plenty of my own money nobody buys me i know where boone is coming from and thats why i want him here beside me where i can keep an eye on him i want the best and more to the point the american people want the best
4296653 with apologies to fdr better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of experimentation than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference
4296654 these problems are bigger than any person or any party so we must work together
4296655 we are not going to let those special interests terminate our effort
4296656 the presidents roosevelt strategy has put us on a course toward a cleaner and more secure future
4296657 nothing is what it seems but everything is exactly what it is
4296658 just like other communities across the nation weve had cases coming up

4296668 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4296669 however the drop in july spread to a few more cities including the previously untouchable vancouver market
4296670 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power
4296671 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4296672 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007 which was a record year for mls sales

4296676 its one of those cities i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan howard is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4296677 and i think that maybe theyre like we dont show up which is what i guess front runner means theyre only on your side when youre winning
4296678 there are definitely games dont get me wrong where im like damn you know we are getting booed and we need to get booed because were not doing well
4296679 the whole thing was look here we are in the playoffs were at home were in first place theres really nothing to boo about were not going to win every game as long as we win by one when it comes down to the finish but go out there and support us when carlos ruiz comes up to the plate dont boo him because you want chris coste in the game this man has a job to do today encourage him to do his job to the best of his abilities
4296680 the term front runner and what it actually means and to what i was using it what was going through my mind they werent accurate front runners is like people who only show up when youre winning hey were going to cheer you if you win thats not it about philly fans theyre passionate they show up like i said 45 000 weve got like 42 sellouts they announce it everynight thats not what i meant like i said its the fact that here we are at this point of the year come out and be supportive dont necessarily get on us we can use that positve energy and you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down
4296681 my round was well managed and i think that if you had to pinpoint something it was distance control so when i was uncomfortable with a certain hole location and there are going to be some of those on this course i was able to just hit the ball in the middle of the green and then give myself an easy two putt
4296682 it was one of those rounds that when i had to a hole six eight 10 footer for par i did

4296712 less sullied and more youthful than his better known rivals mr kennedy neither a martinite nor a chr tienite bears no scars from the partys internecine wars and might thus be regarded as a leader who can heal the rifts
4296713 more importantly although 81 per cent of liberals told the strategic counsel they believe the party can form the next government delegates will in fact be electing a new opposition leader for potentially five years by that time messrs ignatieff and rae with all their liabilities would be into their mid 60s not an age perhaps to galvanize the emerging generation mr kennedy would be just 51 seasoned federally and leaning slightly left a nightmare for jack laytons ndp
4296714 almost everyone who engages with mr kennedy seems to come away impressed with his intelligence his command of whatever dossier is in front of him his commitment to constructive change his prodigious work ethic and his essential rootedness oh yes and charisma a word much debased but applicable to mr kennedy he may look like a milky chartered accountant and youre unlikely to ever see him pirouette with a rose in his teeth but put him in front of a crowd to talk about poverty or education or gender wage equity and the life force emerges palpably
4296715 he knew the issues up and down understood the complexity of public education and he was really passionate about it he didnt just talk the talk
4296716 but hes persuasive i saw him address a roomful of trustees that was ready to lynch him and after 40 minutes they gave him a standing ovation
4296717 in mr fullans judgment four things made mr kennedy effective concern for social justice his sheer intellectual prowess an obsession with results and indefatigable energy
4296718 this is one ambitious and motivated guy maybe thats what attracted me he is solid he knows what he wants
4296719 one day im going to go into politics you know that
4296720 my mother actually made me believe that the reason i had a specially built shoe was that the other kids just hadnt got theirs yet
4296721 he made up for with sheer tenacity he wasnt reckless on the ice but he was determined and fearless hed immerse himself in the moment and i think it connects to his life hes purpose driven its hardwired into him
4296722 he had immense leadership capabilities he seemed able to do everything in the course of a day hed run budgets do research give a speech negotiate with food companies handle media interviews and then be out on the floor at midnight filling bags of food that he would personally deliver
4296723 very good at approaching things from a different perspective the whole volunteer component that you didnt need money but could ask for goods and services without offering tax receipts that was gerard he truly believed you could appeal to peoples better instincts sometimes his faith was vindicated sometimes it wasnt
4296724 people would call at all hours of the night because they knew hed be there

4296740 i joined the liberal party as a youth delegate at our last leadership convention i joined the liberal party because i was inspired by leaders such as laurier pearson and trudeau liberal leaders that made canada the nation it has become today liberal leaders that made canada give to the world the concept of peacekeeping the notion of a just society multiculturalism and a belief in a responsibility to protect i believe once again that it will be a liberal leader who will empower our country with the tools that will be necessary for us to continue on a certain path towards greater opportunity economic prosperity and environmental sustainability in the 21st century i believe we have found such a leader worthy to lead the party of laurier pearson and trudeau and his name is gerard kennedy gerard has proven himself in every endeavor thus far whether managing the toronto food bank or as a great education minister in ontario as a competent compassionate visionary gerard has the compassion and vision that says ours must be the party that builds a society where every canadian counts every canadian matters every day all the time

4296757 its time we became more enterprising in our approach to supporting women and families to give them more choices while maximizing our workforce in a globalized economy
4296758 gerard knows that the economic success of women is a key factor in the overall success of our globalized economy

4296769 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4296770 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4296771 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4296772 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4296773 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4296774 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4296775 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level

4296801 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government

4296817 i love that road its a scenic highway country road on the weekends its a tourist attraction with bicyclists and painters and photographers are on the road enjoying the scenery
4296818 the skepticism i have comes from a history of having surprises sprung on us
4296819 i hope it is exactly as they say im going to study this and make sure there is no catch
4296820 hes a guy that was physically tortured for five and a half years in vietnam had his bones broken and nobody reset them he reset his own arms his arms still dont work right because when they snapped his bones there was no doctor to reset his bones for him
4296821 we went up to one of these newsstand guys and he said i have one left i hid it in the back it was awesome
4296822 did you see how they were doing those tricks so the trainers would throw them those lettuce heads
4296823 is that why you like them so much honey because theyre big and they do tricks for lettuce
4296824 well the lions are from africa the zebras remember those wildebeests
4296825 sorry but why couldnt they all break out last week when we were there
4296826 then one day i got a phone call and i ripped out every bit of that carpeting flooding my house with a sea of inescapable seams the cracks that i have been avoiding all my life now completely unavoidable
4296827 the life of joseph 4 the sure hand of gods providence victory over victimization
4296828 its a terribly sad time for esther shes staying away from all her old buddies because she doesnt want to worry anyone
4296829 she is not sick at all she is doing wonderfully well
4296830 i was told by my adoptive parents that i joined them as a family member as an infant and my biological dad was different and not like the rest of us those remarks often caused me to fantasise and wonder about just me who my birth dad really was a monster a member of the traveling circus
4296831 it was like meeting myself 30 years ago hes got a different talent but same drive and passion and certainly the same sense of humor
4296832 obviously if i knew he was going to be this successful i would have kept him
4296833 deep concern over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir
4296834 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi
4296835 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4296836 were so excited we just told the family this past monday they thought it was great news i couldnt hide it any more the second time you show faster
4296837 i point to my belly and tell her theres a baby in my belly
4296838 stranger things have happened you know that stuff does happen right so i dont know well see what happens i have a wonderful wife who is very capable and who knows maybe well have a surprise
4296839 sometime when i wasnt doing music for six months dennis came along and picked up on the band and stole them from me
4296840 the next time i was ready to do a concert i called up my band master and he said we cant play because were going to an undisclosed location in the persian gulf on an aircraft carrier playing for the troops
4296841 i said how did you book that i want that gig he said dennis knows this general and thats how it happened
4296842 thats how i found out dennis had my band and i had to go and get another band and train them all over again
4296843 dennis is an old friend of mine were like family friends
4296844 we all have so much fun together im so lucky my dad and ashton get along its not weird theres no jealousy or drama if we werent all entirely morally opposed to doing a reality show i guarantee it would be the best selling reality show ever
4296845 i do not say we are decoupled what i am saying is that we are less completely coupled there is a big difference
4296846 when we were completely coupled we were totally dependent on us demand when that demand slows singapores it exports will also slow but now if the us slows down it does not follow that china and india will slow down as well
4296847 i think in the real world of politics never mind the theory nobody wants a hard landing for america if we can postpone the rate at which it is going to slow down we may avoid a catastrophic collapse
4296848 the system is there but the system cannot run with inadequate mediocre men you need top men able men to choose able people to join you to make sure that at every level you have the most able the most meritocratic people in charge
4296849 so what is it that we are trying to do for the opposition we are not trying to block them we are trying to force them to collect a group of mps or candidates that will equal us in integrity and competence so that when the time comes if we fail they have a team that is equal to us who can take over
4296850 we have an economy which is diversified we have a workforce that we have upgraded year by year better educated better able to earn more because we are connected with the world and our incomes can rise because of our higher skills and higher technology
4296851 we have succeeded so far in housing in health in education in job facilities
4296852 we will do our best to re train people who are being retrenched to upgrade their skills but we must face facts this gap is going to remain for five ten or more years
4296853 it certainly appears that dr chee has been made a target by the singapore government and that their criticism of him has gone far beyond a reasonable standard
4296854 however in cases involving pap litigants or pap interests there are concerns about an actual or apparent lack of impartiality and or independence
4296855 never chase a lie let it alone and it will run itself to death

4296918 im actually making more money than i am at my job
4296919 sam i would like to give my sincere thanks for helping me start my online business i was already familiar with people making money on the internet but i had no clue how to start your website showed me everything i needed to know and more my income is around 300 a day but yesterday i had my highest ever day 648 my kids are so proud of me thank you
4296920 hi sam everythings going well over here 150 a day and growing all the time now of course my online income has supplemented the income i get working but i have taken the decision to still teach because i love it so much my income is twice what it was half from my job and half from the internet working probably less than 90 minutes a day
4296921 this marketing consultant quit his 100 000 job because he was making so much money online
4296922 if you had told me eight months ago that i would have quit my consulting job that pays over 100 000 a year and even pays for my travel i would have laughed in your face i still cant believe the time and freedom that ive created in my life my income is around 7000 a month solely from the internet businesses so ive discussed it with my wife and i quit my job today the income is secure because ive developed 4 main income streams so if things go wrong i have strong backup im 46 years old and i feel like a 26 year old looking into a bright new future
4296923 even with one income stream im now close to paying off at least 21 000 debt that accumulated over the last few years what im doing now is setting up another income stream to pay for all the things i want to buy hopefully a bmw x5 by next year if things go to plan
4296924 my wife and i are very grateful for having stumbled across your website a few months ago she was very excited but i was skeptical to say the least however your tips were very easy to follow and i was up and running in a few days then two months later i added the second income stream thats when things started to really take off now were doing very well and are flying to europe tomorrow morning for 3 months we look forward to checking our stats while on vacation a very hearty thank you from both of us

4296935 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief

4297000 how do you train over a conference call there are way too many distractions
4297001 a few years ago 2005 06 we won 21 games and set a school record and we had the good fortune of coaching the first all america in mit history mike dauria when he was a senior and we won 21 games we also had the conference rookie of the year jimmy bartolotta from colorado now he is an all american as well as an academic all american so you can see that over the last few years there has been a shift in the culture of the basketball program people see that and read about it and realize that mit can be tops in schooling and basketball and that certainly helps recruiting as well
4297002 it helps to have at least one guy back there who can at least alter some shots
4297003 going back to when i was playing when i started playing basketball in fourth grade in oklahoma where i grew up my coach was named jack hale i fell in love with basketball just because i love the sport but also because he is a great guy someone who i felt comfortable with he was nice and he was understanding so that was my first image of a basketball coach since then throughout my career as a player and as a coach myself there was a teacher at bethlehem central high school in albany new where i went to high school after i moved from oklahoma named chuck abba he was a coaching legend there i didnt play for him but i ended up working with him for a year after i graduated from clark and before i went to grad school he taught me a lot about how to structure practices and really that when you are a coach you are a teacher and you are an educator he demanded a lot from his players but he also understood them his son actually won a national championship at williams in the pro ranks phil jackson has been a big influence on me especially when he was in chicago and was able to manage players in the nba it is so important to manage personalities because everybody is good and so it is a matter of finding the right chemistry and getting the right characters to believe in your philosophy i think that phil jackson has done that ive read all of his books he talks a lot about the zen buddhist philosophy and he got his players to buy into it he got jordan to buy into it he was able to get those guys to buy in to what he was talking about the five fingers on a hand coming together and that sort of thing i think that in the college ranks i admire the way that coach k runs his program and that hes been there so long and that he may not always have the best players in the country but he gets the guys who are the right fit for duke and for the campus and for his program that says a lot of course john wooden i was looking at his website the other day and there was a little blurb there about how he believes that his time management and discipline were the most important factors in his success plus getting to know players on an individual basis as people that is a key ingredient in my philosophy and that is one reason that i got into psychology i really enjoy getting to know our players at mit larry anderson at mit has been a tremendous influence as well he has taught me so much about the game and about building a program especially as it relates to attention to detail offensive and defensive strategy and how to get the most out of players
4297004 by many peoples standards mbia and ambac look cheap but the question is whether or not theyre safe given the experience of third avenue with this type of investment there is some comfort that its shown some competency in execution
4297005 it doesnt mean three months from now everything will be all right it can take a long time

4297253 las creencias sociales cualesquiera que sea su origen tienen una doble condici n son tradiciones o recuerdos colectivos pero tambi n son unas ideas o unas convenciones del conocimiento del presente
4297254 las ideas del presente son capaces de oponerse a los recuerdos apartarlos y transformarlos porque las ideas son la expresi n de una experiencia colectiva
4297255 nuestros recuerdos se presentan en forma de 4 de ah que el desarrollo de la imaginaci n puede llegar a ser cuestionable por la subjetividad impl cita y cito a ricoeur para explicar esto la imaginaci n est autorizada para so ar a la memoria en cambio se la exhorta a ser verdadera a la imaginaci n le pedimos que sea creativa inventora libre no coartada en tanto que a la memoria le pedimos que represente con fidelidad verazmente aquello que no es pero que alguna vez fue

4297259 there are no kids here we dont allow kids here
4297260 id like to be known for my credits as a computer tech for swinging its something i do in my spare time its a hobby not a life long dream
4297261 any citizen of the city of des moines is going to need a business license to conduct a home occupation business
4297262 i would need them to come in and describe the parameters of what they would be doing
4297263 a wonderful sign of humanitarian concern of the united states in the form of the u s military assistance has arrived
4297264 this is the first of many such shipments that will come both by u s naval forces and our air force its a sign of our commitment to georgias peaceful future its peaceful present our close ties of friendship our common interests our common values
4297265 the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4297266 georgia is a small neighbor of russia it is a country that has made considerable progress in terms of its economy it is still trying to secure its democratic institutions and weve worked with georgia on that but if anyone had any doubts about our support for georgia you only have to look at the fact that its a millennium challenge country which is one of the most important designations that the united states can make that we believe in the future of that country
4297267 after this the gunmen fired in the air several times and so we had to move back
4297268 this was followed by an explosion on a nearby mountain presumably from artillery fire or a tank and while all this was going on one russian officer was telling me that everything was calm in gori that there was no looting
4297269 this is a nightmare some kind of a bad dream from which one has to wake up
4297270 there is immense aggression directed against absolutely innocent people we are living under occupation
4297271 i am from sukhumi first russia kicked me out from my home there in the early 1990s now they are also expelling us from our land georgia has been through the same thing twice and no one knows for what
4297272 i brought food some milk cheese and eggs ill leave it all here so that its distributed among the displaced
4297273 the president has asked us to help these people as well as the prime minister im a georgian man i have a little farm why else do i need any of it if i dont help my fellow georgians
4297274 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport two days ago reports said we had destroyed the airport
4297275 this is not true we have not been engaged in any military action for two days only conducting reconnaissance
4297276 there are a lot of weapons which need to be guarded to prevent them from being stolen and used
4297277 the withdrawal plan has not been approved yet the buildup of the units has been suspended
4297278 the coast guard plays a huge role in patrolling gitmos guantanamo waters
4297279 not only does it provide protection to gitmos shores and the caribbean but also it provides assistance at any time
4297280 its nice to see everyone come out to support the coast guard for this race
4297281 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4297282 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4297283 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4297284 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here
4297285 eucom forces will remain ready to support as further needs are assessed
4297286 our relations with the alliance cannot but be affected after mr jaap de hoop scheffer failed to say a word about the victims of the attack not a single word has been uttered in condemnation of the aggression
4297287 i hope that this will not affect security as a whole
4297288 other similar structures no longer measure up to modern security requirements
4297289 georgia is a respected partner and friend and one day georgia will join nato
4297290 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4297291 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4297292 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he will be true to his word and that those operations will halt
4297293 and we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis it is long overdue too many innocent people have died
4297294 i appeal for help for many people its too late but i appeal for the help of every civilized person in the world to stop this uncivilized barbarian inhuman treacherous absolutely outrageous behavior and to save innocent lives
4297295 our troops are outside the towns of gori and senaki they did not enter those towns
4297296 they moved to those areas only because georgians troops took positions there to fire on south ossetia
4297297 why not lift the curtain on what is being delivered by u s airplanes to georgia
4297298 although georgian president mikheil saakashvili asked the international community for humanitarian aid quite understandably what is going on there we russians are deeply concerned about it
4297299 the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4297300 this is a small neighbor of russia it is a country that has made considerable progress in terms of its economy it is still trying to secure its democratic institutions and weve worked with georgia on that but if anyone had any doubts about our support for georgia you only have to look at the fact that its a millennium challenge country which is one of the most important designations that the united states can make that we believe in the future of that country
4297301 we will support any decision that the people of south ossetia and abkhazia will make in accordance with the un charter the 1966 international conventions and the helsinki act on security and cooperation in europe
4297302 we will not only support these decisions but will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4297303 as for our independence as for our movement toward this goal no other force will stop us we have set this goal and we will move toward this goal together as for the ways to achieve this goal we will find them
4297304 this is a nightmare some kind of a bad dream from which one has to wake up
4297305 there is immense aggression directed against absolutely innocent people we are living under occupation
4297306 i am from sukhumi first russia kicked me out from my home there in the early 1990s now they are also expelling us from our land georgia has been through the same thing twice and no one knows for what
4297307 i brought food some milk cheese and eggs ill leave it all here so that its distributed among the displaced
4297308 the president has asked us to help these people as well as the prime minister im a georgian man i have a little farm why else do i need any of it if i dont help my fellow georgians
4297309 the objective of this exercise is to bring our unique abilities together in a common cause defense of the panama canal and the region
4297310 the importance of the panama canal to the worlds economy and the stability enjoyed by the region make them both attractive targets to those who would do harm to either
4297311 the protection of the canal and maintaining stability in the region is truly a worthy goal and one whose achievement benefits all
4297312 it was a major opportunity wasted but thats what happens when your security and military policy depends on the united states
4297313 after the talks the presidents agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries at the ambassadorial level in line with the un charter and international law
4297314 whatever is happening i dont think it is attributable to rogue elements
4297315 in any intelligence service especially for covert operations you often try to maintain a level of deniability so that the top decision makers are not fully informed about what is going on
4297316 there are still huge differences between the military and the politicians as to how to combat terrorism what to do about it the military is really controlling the policy the civilians dont have much of a say
4297317 this is one of the reasons why pakistan has not been able to fight the war on terror decisively and why there are so many differences with the americans on this not everyone is reading from the same page
4297318 formally the director general of the isi reports to the prime minister the director general of the isi however is a three star general appointed by the chief of army staff who reports to the president the eight departments of the isi are headed by eight two star generals who are chosen by the director general of the isi and the budget comes out of the defense and intelligence budget which is not subject to civilian review in pakistan
4297319 so while formally the isi reports to the prime minister the control is effectively lodged with the military
4297320 now how that actually works that is who finally makes decisions i dont know
4297321 isi is heavily manned by people from the armed forces so it is not an organization which is a purely civilian organization
4297322 it would be correct to say that it has not been controlled really by the prime minister the way it should be technically and constitutionally it is under the control of the prime minister but operationally speaking and substantively speaking the prime ministers have not really even strengthened the defense cabinet committees
4297323 as the isi stands today it pretty much doesnt function under these kind of parliament related civilian controls
4297324 past that period the isi strategy that has flowered the training that was given was really essentially
4297325 and the tools the assets that were developed by the intelligence agency were subsequently used to reach the goals of pakistans own security interests and for battling pakistans own security threats as perceived by intelligence agencies in pakistan
4297326 this country has been under military rule quite a lot when it has been under military rule one section of the isi has been used by military rulers to engineer the political situation in the country
4297327 and for that it has earned a very bad reputation
4297328 internally obviously there has always been a big question that we need to have an organization which reports to the executive and the reporting lines are stringent and there is oversight thats the concern within the country
4297329 there has been an effort in the past under general musharraf the question of growing a nexus between the executive authority and the isi so that there is unity of command general musharraf has been very keen that the intelligence agency would come completely under his control
4297330 now the question of course is with an elected government how do you arrange this control of the isi
4297331 lt sterett was born in baltimore in 1778 and it is fantastic to be in a town with such great nautical history
4297332 he was a brave naval hero at a time when the navy was a fledgling force he is an incredible individual and we welcome his spirit on board
4297333 i never thought id get to come to maryland on board my ship and see my local maryland citizens
4297334 we wanted to become part of cg 31 and carry on the tradition of the sailors who cruised before us
4297335 this commissioning flag was from the vietnam era ships ceremony
4297336 normally the flag is supposed to go the commanding officer but the signalman who raised it kept it
4297337 he said he would be honored if we flew his flag
4297338 there is a great line of history here and this is just another artifact of that history
4297339 to know that another quartermaster or signalman raised this flag up many years ago is very exciting to me
4297340 being so new to the navy its an honor to be a plank owner many years from now i can say i was here when the ship was commissioned i could also say when i was 20 i raised the commissioning flag
4297341 we have a stronger hull as well as improved isolation systems
4297342 this makes it easier to isolate chill water firemains or anything else we need to shut off
4297343 we can use circuit boards and software that are industry standards today
4297344 it keeps us modern and more sophisticated it also allows us to bring the latest and greatest technology to the navy
4297345 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to ones self and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4297346 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired
4297347 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4297348 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4297349 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4297350 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4297351 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4297352 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4297353 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4297354 a film without funds is like a body without a heart
4297355 i dont even have time for teaching all i do is assess assess assess
4297356 it starts for me with the wardrobe just like stepping into the character
4297357 im constantly in there about wardrobe thats my passion ive got to constantly be creative ronon has always been on the run and he makes his clothes and hes got these imperfections and it wears the scars of him running hes like ive bled in these this is my home thats what it is his boots and his clothes thats what hes carried to me that was very important wardrobe
4297358 i dreaded my hair because i dont want to be the pretty boy and the hunk
4297359 i didnt want it to be all about my face it originally started from that and i hated that because im just not that from that spawned the dreads i just wanted different roles
4297360 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4297361 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4297362 first hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda

4297371 i can prove it with the international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4297372 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4297373 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4297374 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4297375 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4297376 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4297377 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4297378 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians

4297458 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4297459 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4297460 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4297465 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4297466 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4297467 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town
4297468 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus

4297475 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses

4297478 tiga perkara yang boleh mengeratkan persahabatan dengan silaturahim iaitu memberi salam apabila bertemu dengannya dan menyediakan tempat duduknya dalam sesuatu majlis serta panggillah dengan nama yang paling disenanginya
4297479 sesungguhnya allah menyukai kemesraan dan keakraban kawan lama maka peliharalah kemesraan itu
4297480 apabila kamu saling berjumpa maka saling mengucap salam dan bersalam salaman dan apabila berpisah maka berpisahlah dengan ucapan beristighfar
4297481 apabila kawan seorang muslim diumpat dan dia tidak menyanggah membelanya padahal sebenarnya dia mampu membelanya maka allah akan merendahkannya di dunia dan akhirat

4297485 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4297486 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4297487 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4297488 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4297489 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
4297490 for the first time we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits

4297495 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4297496 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4297497 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4297498 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4297499 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4297500 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4297501 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4297502 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4297503 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4297504 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4297505 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4297506 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4297507 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4297508 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4297509 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4297510 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4297511 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4297512 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4297513 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4297514 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4297515 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4297516 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4297517 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4297518 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4297519 i see your imodium and raise half a roll of toilet paper
4297520 if you were to see the american team in street clothes they dont look like theyre 18 or 19 year old athletes

4297522 they need to check it out because i think theyre cheating
4297523 the campaign did not pledge any federal matching funds certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4297524 we asked for a bonus they didnt want to do a bonus and they offered me a major league contract
4297525 i can tell you how it impacted me it didnt impact me at all i pitched the same whether i had a 3 million bonus or a 4 million contract it may have increased expectations but it still didnt affect the way i pitched
4297526 it affected everybody outside of me the fans the organization they act more different than the player does
4297527 if a player has a true desire to perform well and pitch well he should have that whether or not he has a timetable thats been increased i think it affects the expectations outside of the individual himself it all starts with the outside people
4297528 it took me a few years to iron out some things that didnt go well for me and it wouldve taken a few years whether i had a major league contract or not its not like i was going faster or slower because of my contract the outcome probably wouldve been different but as a pitcher i wouldve progressed exactly the same from year to year
4297529 id have to go back and look but i think thats been a recent phenomenon
4297530 i think you rely on your scouting department to give you an honest evaluation of where you think that guys going to be at within a particular timeframe because youre dealing with a clock your scouting department has got to be reliable

4297537 they pay tribute to harry caray they always say a one a two a three let me hear ya and then at the end of it they say ok lets get some runs like harry always did
4297538 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4297539 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4297540 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4297541 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4297542 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4297543 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4297544 i watched him a lot when i lived in phoenix
4297545 its such a random play that you dont know if youll ever have that chance in a game but just in case i worked on it
4297546 he pretty much told me to go up there like im hitting 3 4 or 5
4297547 it helps because coming off the bench is something ive never done
4297548 i think it can only make me better going into next year and having a job somewhere
4297549 that at this level every run can be pretty big

4297558 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4297559 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4297568 pastilah pasti itu bisa kita penuhi tahun depan tetapi tunggu saja pidato presiden besok
4297569 sekarang ini memang belum tercapai angka 20 persen itu akan dicapai secara bertahap sesuai dengan kondisi ekonomi dan angka 20 persen akan dipenuhi presiden pada tahun depan bagaimananya tunggu saja presiden besok akan berpidato
4297570 di apbn 2008 memang tidak bisa dipenuhi karena adanya subsidi yang besar dan naiknya harga minyak mentah dunia namun tahun depan akan dilihat lagi kalau akan memenuhinya yang 20 persen berarti harus ada pilihan yaitu pos anggaran yang dikurangi akan tetapi itu yang akan disampaikan presiden besok di dpr
4297571 presiden akan memberikan pernyataan di pidato besok bagi saya bukan positif atau negatif keputusan mk itu tetapi itu masalah konstitusi

4297581 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4297582 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4297583 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4297584 he cares about his on court performance more than he ever has in his life
4297585 whatever adelman needs me to do come off the bench be the sixth or seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4297586 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4297587 we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far
4297588 the attorney general asks that the appeal be heard as soon as there is available time to hear it
4297589 the implications are significant what were talking about is an order declaring an important law of no force and effect
4297590 the government should be doing their work as we speak
4297591 the civil liberties association like the plaintiffs themselves is responding to what in essence is a health care crisis in the downtown eastside
4297592 we talk about it all the time but its really really true
4297593 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4297594 they really believe because of their age and agility that that makes up for lack of experience that their reflexes are faster and theyre stronger physically
4297595 and so they believe theyre better drivers in fact than older people who have a lot more experience
4297596 it shows them first hand that this too could happen to you
4297597 with all the work that weve done with teens this is really reinforcing what they tell us anecdotally
4297598 they do have a feeling that theyre invincible its always someone else whos the bad driver not them and its really difficult to get them to understand the consequences of bad choices
4297599 you cant just have a program for the teens you cant just show it to them once
4297600 but when you look at it very carefully its usually not bad luck its usually someone has made a bad choice someone has chosen to drink and drive chosen not to wear seatbelts or to speed or be out on a lake at midnight when theres no light
4297601 so its never just one person who loses their life its the whole family losing a child losing a loved one losing a parent it is tragic and it shakes the whole family and they never ever recover
4297602 he did the mother ship he did the movie and he did criminal intent god knows hell probably do whatever the future show is
4297603 i can always see chris coming back how shall i put it hes not the prodigal son hes the wandering son
4297604 unfortunately i dont think i ever took that stuff that seriously
4297605 in the great tradition of franchise leave takings not on the same drop your teeth level as some have been but i think its pretty satisfying
4297606 if that label is directed at someone who isnt a racist id argue that the word has no power at all
4297607 many people are determined to hate senator barack obama but cmon lets just be honest for a change it all has to do with the color of his skin and his self confidence
4297608 and if something falls on the floor dont pick it up
4297609 a man who cant handle tools is not a man

4297623 works every time taking it to a downloaded version 1 1 4 fw
4297624 they said that the 2 0 overdrives the hardrive or in other words pushes it too hard for it to work he also said that trying to update to 2 0 too many times in a short period might cause permanent damage to the hardrive
4297625 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused

4297629 un ambiente que se puede convertir en tiniebla y sombra de muerte
4297630 nos apesara que en este momento existe un ambiente que se puede convertir en tiniebla y sombra de muerte el cual impacta en los nicarag enses de modo que su entorno resulta opaco y complejo
4297631 es temerosa la sombra oscura que se viene levantando con figura de pobreza extrema y hambre originada en parte pro el alza mundial del precio del petr leo el deslizamiento de la moneda el crecimiento desmedido de la canasta b sica las cat strofes como el incendio que destruy el mercado oriental y el insuficiente salario m nimo
4297632 la tensi n que esto implica genera adem s otro tipo de problemas como la violencia intrafamiliar abandono de los estudios estancamiento cultural toma de tierras delincuencia creciente migraci n forzada inseguridad ciudadana narcotr fico y hasta conflictos armados
4297633 la falta de transparencia en el manejo y distribuci n de algunas ayudas venidas de otros pa ses ha despertado la preocupaci n de la socidad nicarag ense y de la comunidad donante internacional apareciendo una vez m s la sombra de la corrupci n que deteriora la econom a nacional
4297634 hay una indiferencia c vica ciudadana que se manifiesta en una falta de inter s por las elecciones y la participaci n en otras actividades de la vida p blica debido a que ha bajado notablemente el nivel tico del discurso pol tico convertido en discurso enga oso cargado de insultos descalificaci n del adversario y hasta calumnioso
4297635 desalienta la ausencia de un liderazgo de calidad y comprometido que norme la acci n pol tica en la que todo parece estar al servicio de personas grupos de poder y de partido en detrimento del bien com n
4297636 la regresi n de formas superadas de autoritarismo no se pueden ver como acciones desestabilizadoras todas las opiniones de desacuerdo que brotan en los diversos sectores ni se pueden estar insultando y recriminando constantemente a quien no est alineado al pensamiento del grupo gobernante
4297637 frustraci n pol tica en la ciudadan a debido a determinaciones institucionales que reducen los espacios de participaci n deteriorando el pluralismo pol tico se percibe un malestar creciente por el rumor popular de una posible distribuci n de cuotas de poder en los poderes legislativo electoral y judicial que condicionan las determinaciones
4297638 consideramos que est deteriorando la estabilidad social y econ mica del pa s el hecho que algunos de los que participan en la vida p blica frecuentemente est n utilizando un lenguaje descalificador violento y confrontativo
4297639 se faltar a a la responsabilidad social al crecimiento econ mico a la reconciliaci n y a la paz si se promueve la polarizaci n de la sociedad la desconfianza en la inversi n extranjera el avivamiento del odio de clases la descalificaci n el exclusivismo y la represi n
4297640 partimos del hecho que todo ciudadano tiene derecho a elegir y ser elegido faltar amos a nuestra responsabilidad ciudadana si nos mantenemos al margen en el jercicio de este derecho dejando en manos de un solo sector el dedicidir sobre el rumbo de nuestros gobiernos municipales
4297641 la participaci n m s amplia en los asuntos pol ticos del pa s se dar a a trav s de elecciones democr ticas desarrolladas en condiciones favorables sin inclinaciones injustas que vayan a favorecer o privilegiar cualquier ideolog a que se proclamara ser la nica int rprete de las aspiraciones del pueblo
4297642 aunque ocasionalmente en el ambiente social se perciben dudas sobre la transparencia en el proceso electoral el ciudadano deber a persistir en su voto queremos hacer un llamado al sentido de responsabilidad de los laicos para que est n presentes en la vida p blica y m s concreto en la formaci n de los consensos necesarios y en la oposici n contra las injusticias
4297643 la ley electoral deber a garantizar el buen desarrollo de las elecciones lamentablemente ha surgido un clima de desconfianza e incredulidad frente a la instituci n llamada a ejecutar esta ley el consejo supremo electoral lo que suscita sospecha en un sector de los participantes y sociedad en general
4297644 exhortamos al fiel cumplimiento de las normas que garanticen un juego limpio y transparente basado en la verdad consideramos que es un grave reto moral de los miembros del consejo electoral recuperar la credibilidad y devolver la confianza a los ciudadanos
4297645 fortalecimiento de la confianza en el proceso la necesidad de
4297646 es claro que las instituciones que presiden nuestra naci n como la corte suprema de justicia y la asamblea nacional no est n al margen de toda esta realidad y hasta pueden ser utilizadas para maniobrar el proceso electoral desde decisiones oscuras por es nuestro deber hacerles un respetuoso llamado a todos los insignes miembros de tan honorables instituciones
4297647 a mantener la objetividad el profesionalismo y la fidelidad constitucional sobre todo en momento de elecciones es sabido que la log stica militar y policial ha ayudado al sano desenvolvimiento del clima electoral por ello exhortamos a que en este momento contin en siendo fieles a la ley y a los m s nobles ideales de su instituci n
4297648 los exhortamos a ser fieles a la verdad objetividad y al profesionalismo para no promover el error en el voto del pueblo y la frustraci n cuando ya no se pueda corregir la decisi n si la informaci n conceptual que se emite no corresponde a la verdad o se manipula se es c mplice de una decisi n desacertada
4297649 cuando los medios de comunicaci n manejan la verdad el profesionalismo y la objetividad se convierten en la conciencia de la naci n lo cual implica fidelidad y perseverancia a pesar de posibles determinaciones que atenten contra la libertad de expresi n
4297650 n o haver possibilidade de se ter essa estrutura sem licita o nessa nova sistem tica queremos viabilizar empreendimentos que antes se discutia se eram para carga pr pria ou se eram para carga de terceiros

4297665 there is any other objectively justifiable and reasonable grounds for declining consent for example that the event will be or is likely to be offensive
4297666 while local shops and individuals can sell daffodil day goodies throughout august or purchase fresh daffodils on the official day to raise funds for the cancer cause why not decorate your shop window with all things yellow colour your hair wear yellow nail polish or yellow clothes for a gold coin donation
4297667 ask friends and family members to give a gold coin donation for your hair colouring efforts or school kids could pay a gold coin to wear yellow to school painting the town yellow is both a great way to remind your neighbours that daffodil day is coming and a fun way to help raise funds
4297668 one in two people will hear the words you have cancer before they are 85 years old on a local level that means around 1500 people in our region are diagnosed with cancer each year with 600 dying as a result its important we do everything we can to help people in the western community who are struggling because of cancer
4297669 last year residents from the western region raised over 166 400 from daffodil day which was a fantastic effort
4297670 more than 3 5 million was raised in nsw these vital funds assist the cancer council in its mission to defeat cancer by providing essential services to the people of the central west such as the cancer council helpline on 131120
4297671 this year were aiming to raise even more and with your help we will be able to ease the burden of cancer in the central west
4297672 mr rees told the conference hes received a report from a special review committee he established and has referred it to his department
4297673 the committee of ian armstrong and col gellatley has looked at ways the government might consider drought proofing country towns
4297674 their report to the minister now with the department will be further open to debate after the local government elections
4297675 any town will be able to take part in what the state government proposes in the way towns are drought proofed in future towns that do not want to be part of the plans will not have to
4297676 because it would be difficult to pump water uphill to orange
4297677 orange is happy planning as they are to obtain a secure water supply from other sources
4297678 i asked minister rees to raise our case with the nsw fire brigades commissioner greg mullins
4297679 i think bathurst owes a vote of thanks to both minister rees and commissioner mullins for listening to our concerns and acting quickly with a positive response
4297680 all levels of management have been lisiasing on this one
4297681 because of the ongoing problems at bathurst the decision was made to redirect resources so the next new fire engine off the production line will be sent to bathurst
4297682 this great outcome is the result of negotiations between local member gerard martin emergency services minister nathan rees and nsw fire brigade commissioner greg mullins
4297683 now could we do that if we didnt have a world class faculty and a state of the art facility no wed be another county hospital of last resort

4297685 the most difficult challenge facing gm and the other domestic producers will be accelerating the introduction of fuel efficient vehicles and convincing consumers that these vehicles offer as good a value proposition asian product
4297686 but it introducing more fuel efficient vehicles will remain a very difficult transition to implement

4297696 soms is het leven zo mooi dat het pijn doet
4297697 they are the defending canadian champions and weve beaten b c three out of the last four times
4297698 if we play hard like this against everybody we can win we played hard wednesday too its just a matter of executing and of course getting the kind of pitching marshall dean gave us
4297699 i said before we came here that we would have to get strong pitching and have strong defence
4297700 the positive side is how well we competed after not competing very well
4297701 we made a couple of mistakes in the inning where they scored three
4297702 that was the other area that has to be rock solid
4297703 riley paneluk and terry mcnabb were both excellent and thats a bright spot
4297704 terry really closed the door on them actually he was unfortunate to take the loss in a game we had chances to win
4297705 we had to be better than that and we were
4297706 we came back against a very very good ontario team
4297707 i had just one three putt one bad sand shot cost me a stroke but no it was pretty good
4297708 i took a five on 14 and not a good five
4297709 i was just slightly to the right and i guess i decided to be cute with my flop shot and was short basically i didnt have a good lie and made a bad chip and took the five where i assumed i would walk away with a three
4297710 ken and i are both pretty close so well battle it out pretty good
4297711 last year because of our ranking in provincials we ended up in much harder a pool than we thought wed be in
4297712 we kind of assumed the pool we were in was what the whole tournament would be like so we ended up getting smoked in the first pool but we could have done really well in the second pool
4297713 these were the genetics we needed to take our stud and commercial herds to the next level
4297714 the aim of the week is to encourage students to consider practising in rural areas on the completion of their degree to fill the desperate need for medical practitioners in the country
4297715 students considering taking up the rural clinical placements next year will find this experience invaluable in making their decision
4297716 the students will make several clinical visits with different health services which will vary from a tour of the young health service and mercy care centre to a hands on plaster clinic
4297717 the generosity of the community has been outstanding as it has been in the past with the rotary club providing a barbecue one night for the students with meat donated by bmp
4297718 rural week is a great introduction to medicine in a rural community especially for the many students who have never really been to the country
4297719 i had already made a commitment to remain throughout the implementation of our new levy system so i was hoping to continue on and see it through
4297720 all the speakers were very relevant and to the point following our theme this year of harvest and beyond
4297721 the real push throughout the industry is promoting an export culture and improving our processes from harvest to storage packaging and marketing
4297722 a particularly interesting fact arising from that presentation was that northern hemisphere cherry production is some two million tonnes compared with the counter seasonal production in the southern hemisphere of just over 50 000 tonnes
4297723 so this means that whatever production we can send onto the export market is going to be snapped up with little trouble
4297724 in effect we should not be competing with other southern hemisphere producers such as chile but working together with them to develop security of supply to big consumers
4297725 there was a mandate from the conference to set up a new pty ltd company as a source of information to cherry growers for marketing toward the export market initially and further down the track the domestic market too
4297726 also the new levies of 3c kg for marketing and promotion and especially the 4c kg levy for research and development which is being matched by the government will give us quite a war chest to move forward and improve quality production and marketing for all growers
4297727 this is a fantastic achievement for sarah and a just reward for such a talented and hardworking student
4297728 it will be a great opportunity for sarah to expand her horizons and gain knowledge of just what career paths are available
4297729 she will be surrounded by more than a hundred other like minded students from around australia getting to experience what a life in science and engineering is really like
4297730 sarahs application and interview were outstanding it is no mean feat to be selected from among so many talented students
4297731 we hope that the experience can spur her on to great heights in her education and career
4297732 i like chemistry and physics and would definitely be looking at a career in those areas but dont know much about what is available
4297733 were tremendous fans of fae desmond and her team that organize comic con
4297734 we believe this is the best run event of its kind in the world the organizers are a not for profit group that does a tremendous job in creating a forum to celebrate our popular culture promote our collectibles industry and inform and educate the public
4297735 2008 is our 12th consecutive year exhibiting at comic con
4297736 we started with a simple 10 x 20 space and to be honest we werent entirely sure what we were doing back then that humble start has evolved into one of the largest displays at comic con that now features 48 separate podiums with more than 200 pieces of product
4297737 each year we spend the better part of 6 months in planning and design for comic con because we believe that the event rewards the company that is best prepared
4297738 we labor over every detail over the past decade our approach has become more and more refined as we attempt to elevate our presentation to a level that exceeds the previous year
4297739 several years ago when conferencing with the organizers of comic con sideshow was asked if we could come up with a new way of selling and delivering con exclusives to the attendees the shows organizers told us that one of the top complaints were the long lines for exhibitor exclusives and the fact that not everyone who waited in line would actually receive a show exclusive sideshow developed a plan in which the exclusive con product would be sold to attendees in advance of the show and all the attendees would have to do is come up to the booth at anytime during the event present their id and pick up their product
4297740 we will post nearly 50 different videos during the 5 days of comic con 2008 most of these will be backstage passes that will feature the products on display at the show others will be con interviews and select events that sideshow is involved in our multi media team allows web viewers a unique chance to enjoy new product debuts and get interesting info about the show from the comfort of their own home
4297741 we decided long ago that we should bring as many staff members as possible to the show comic con provides a valuable opportunity for our staff to get face to face with current and prospective collectors
4297742 when we meet people that are just learning about sideshow collectibles we believe that the in person advantage of product presentation is hugely advantageous
4297743 we want the artists to interact with the public and have the opportunity to give them feedback about the artistic process that goes into crafting our products
4297744 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4297745 the aircraft operated four flights without a fully functioning autopilot
4297746 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4297748 they have no need to change anything they do in foreign policy to make themselves look good
4297749 once it was in the air that the olympics could be affected by these issues they had to sit down and think much more concentratedly about each of them
4297750 they didnt want to be out of step with the african union on the question of sudan not wanting to appear as a colonialist power but a cooperative one
4297751 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
4297752 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000

4297757 i think realism in a heightened environment like this is so effective
4297758 to take a zombie like thing and place it in a completely realistic world in a world that we know that we see on youtube in that kind of immediate personal world i think is really attractive
4297759 theres nothing supernatural about the story its realistic start to finish
4297760 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
4297761 if it screams for truth rather than help if it commits itself with a courage it cant be sure it really has if it stands up and admits something is wrong but doesnt insist on blood then its rock n roll we shed our own blood we dont need to shed anyone elses
4297762 my friend joan is applying for a job i think youd like her shes smart learns fast and gets along with everyone

4297782 it felt like my arm exploded and i thought my career was completely over
4297783 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4297784 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4297785 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4297786 its definitely something you think back on the tight ends who have been here
4297787 it makes it interesting weve had it pretty good the last couple of years in terms of consistency of the room with fletcher and tech now both of those guys are gone so im the only one left so it changes
4297788 those guys knew what they were doing theyve been around and had been in the system and now were fresh its back to square one and its the process of the game and the nature of the sport
4297789 you can tell the guys have looked up to him clark
4297790 he has demonstrated how to do things and stayed on top of the details
4297791 hes helping those guys explaining things hes doing a good job from that standpoint
4297792 every year i think training camp it has gotten better my first year i was fatigued mentally my second year it was a little bit of fatigue mentally and physically then last year it was me growing more and more this year i feel great im excited im confident and comfortable its just an exciting moment for me right now the playbook i kind of know it now now i have a chance to work on the little things and worry about doing my job i know i can do my job now its time to get better at doing the little things

4297796 es especialmente importante abstenerse de cualquier paso que pueda directa o indirectamente ser interpretado por los l deres georgianos como un apoyo a sus ambiciones de revancha y llevar a un nuevo escenario tr gico
4297797 no estamos en 1968 en la invasi n de checoslovaquia cuando rusia pod a invadir a un pa s vecino ocupar una capital derrocar a un gobierno y marcharse las cosas han cambiado ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional hacia el que rusia se est moviendo
4297798 cumpla con su compromiso de suspender todas las actividades militares en georgia y que retire a todas sus fuerzas que han entrado en los ltimos d as
4297799 una vez que las tropas georgianas vuelvan a sus cuarteles las fuerzas rusas volver n al territorio de la federaci n rusa
4297800 domesticar a la direcci n georgiana fue uno de los grandes xitos de estados unidos en el c ucaso
4297801 si georgia entra en la otan y estados unidos est ejerciendo presi n para lograrlo una base militar a unas cuantas decenas de kil metros de sochi puerto ruso en el mar negro permitir literalmente apuntar a bocajarro a rusia
4297802 la guerra en georgia ten a como objetivo expulsar del sur del c ucaso a los estadounidenses y a la otan

4297815 never before in the history of advertising has one company been in the position to control prices on up to 90 percent of advertising in a single medium not in television not in radio not in publishing it should not happen on the internet

4297888 raz n de sobra tienen los colombianos cuando hablan con tanto desprecio de la justicia

4297908 the rowers are in for quite a few chances of winning but when racing comes at the olympics it really is difficult to consistently come up with your good results
4297909 the olympics put a lot of pressure on you and people have got to be aware of that
4297910 im just hoping they do all strike it lucky and get the first couple of races under way and get a good roll on it then if the first couple start winning you never know what happens
4297911 i got the first one under way and once that happened i knew there was nothing going to stop me i knew i was the best and the whole team sort of got in that same vibe and we just suddenly felt invincible
4297912 terrorism is the over arching threat to civilized society and there is no focus on this issue as far as the obama campaign is concerned

4298007 the democratization of fashion emphasizes the image of the average person not a female model with an impossible ideal of perfect beauty
4298008 viewers see whats good for them from the people themselves
4298009 people stopped to watch the pictures which gained tremendous exposure
4298010 it is very important for me to document things specific to tel aviv
4298011 i try to use street fashion to show israelis a different type of fashion
4298012 the media and magazines have a very consumerist approach i dont believe that is the meaning of fashion fashion is accessible everyday art
4298013 magazines that impose fashion and preach what is right and necessary
4298014 it doesnt have too many things in it and i dont think it needs very many it is more intriguing and interesting to have a few good clothing items and do as much as possible with them ninety five percent of the clothes in my closet are secondhand i take clothes from my mother and grandmother and from friends people can dress well without a lot of money and make wise purchases

4298020 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4298021 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4298022 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4298023 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4298024 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4298025 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4298026 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4298027 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4298028 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4298029 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4298030 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4298031 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4298032 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4298033 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4298034 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4298035 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4298036 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4298037 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4298038 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4298039 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4298040 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4298041 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4298042 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4298043 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4298044 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4298045 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4298046 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4298047 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4298048 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4298049 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4298050 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4298051 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4298052 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4298053 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4298054 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4298055 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
4298056 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4298057 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4298058 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4298059 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4298060 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

4298062 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4298063 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4298064 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4298065 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4298066 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4298067 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4298068 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4298069 who will be the next president of the united states
4298070 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4298071 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4298072 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4298073 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4298074 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4298075 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4298076 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4298077 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4298078 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4298079 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4298080 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4298081 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4298082 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4298083 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4298084 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4298085 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4298086 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4298087 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4298088 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4298089 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4298090 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4298091 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4298092 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4298093 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4298094 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4298095 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4298096 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4298097 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4298098 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4298099 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4298100 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4298101 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4298102 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4298103 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4298104 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
4298105 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
4298106 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
4298107 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
4298108 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4298109 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4298110 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4298111 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4298112 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4298113 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4298114 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4298115 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4298116 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4298117 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4298118 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4298119 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4298120 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4298121 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4298122 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4298123 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4298124 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4298125 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4298126 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4298127 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4298128 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4298129 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4298130 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4298131 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4298132 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4298133 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4298134 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4298135 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4298136 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4298137 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4298138 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4298139 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4298140 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4298141 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4298142 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4298143 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4298144 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4298145 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4298146 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4298147 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4298148 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4298149 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4298150 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4298151 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4298152 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4298153 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4298154 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4298155 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4298156 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4298157 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4298158 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4298159 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4298160 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4298161 cheios de adornos para nos inspirar no dia a dia os potes decorados brincam com nossa imagina o trazendo mais que uma informa o um deleite para nossos olhos que interpretam verdadeiramente a alma do artista
4298162 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4298163 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4298164 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4298165 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4298166 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4298167 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4298168 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4298169 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4298170 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4298171 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4298172 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4298173 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4298174 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4298175 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4298176 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4298177 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4298178 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4298179 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4298180 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4298181 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4298182 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4298183 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4298184 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4298185 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4298186 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4298187 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4298188 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4298189 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4298190 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4298191 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4298192 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4298193 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4298194 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4298195 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4298196 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4298197 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4298198 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4298199 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4298200 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4298201 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4298202 el erg es un grupo que hace varios a os viene actuando en choc y en los vecinos departamentos de antioquia y risaralda ellos son una disidencia del eln ej rcito de liberaci n nacional y generaron muchos hechos de violencia en la regi n
4298203 dont you want to do something more with your life
4298204 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4298205 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4298206 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4298207 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4298208 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4298209 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4298210 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4298211 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4298212 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4298213 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4298214 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4298215 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4298216 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4298217 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
4298218 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4298219 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
4298220 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
4298221 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
4298222 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
4298223 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
4298224 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4298225 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4298226 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4298227 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4298228 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4298229 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4298230 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4298231 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4298232 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4298233 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4298234 who are open to doing something on the production side
4298235 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4298236 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4298237 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4298238 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4298239 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4298240 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4298241 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4298242 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4298243 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4298244 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4298245 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4298246 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4298247 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4298248 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4298249 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4298250 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4298251 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4298252 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4298253 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4298254 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4298255 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4298256 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4298257 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4298258 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4298259 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4298260 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4298261 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4298262 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4298263 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4298264 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4298265 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4298266 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4298267 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4298268 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4298269 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4298270 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4298271 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4298272 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4298273 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4298274 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4298275 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4298276 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4298277 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4298278 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4298279 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4298280 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4298281 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4298282 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4298283 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4298284 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4298285 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4298286 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4298287 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4298288 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4298289 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4298290 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4298291 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4298292 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4298293 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4298294 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4298295 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4298296 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4298297 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4298298 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4298299 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4298300 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4298301 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4298302 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4298303 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4298304 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4298305 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4298306 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4298307 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4298308 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4298309 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4298310 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4298311 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4298312 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4298313 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4298314 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4298315 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4298316 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4298317 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4298318 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4298319 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4298320 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4298321 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4298322 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4298323 i dont believe in relying on search engine rankings in order to successfully run your business
4298324 to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful
4298325 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4298326 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4298327 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4298328 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4298329 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4298330 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4298331 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4298332 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4298333 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4298334 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4298335 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4298336 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4298337 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4298338 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4298339 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4298340 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4298341 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4298342 a specific term or phrase that is relevant to their sites content
4298343 bloggers spam prevention robots have detected that my blog has characteristics of a spam blog
4298344 its been two years everybodys talking about we couldnt defend the pick and roll couldnt do this couldnt do that its not true we did prove that
4298345 i think they are the best team in the tournament right now
4298346 they are more focused on their goals and thats why theyre favorite for me
4298347 after their 2006 loss in the semifinal against us they came over here to prove that theyre a better team and that game was something bad for them theyre a team in the real meaning of the word and thats what they show on the court
4298348 because two years ago everybody would go coast to coast everybody could make the layup for greece
4298349 and today we saw that they used their bodies because theyre a very athletic team very athletic players thats the difference between the two games we played
4298350 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4298351 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4298352 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4298353 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4298354 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4298355 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4298356 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4298357 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4298358 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4298359 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4298360 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4298361 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4298362 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4298363 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4298364 in the fast fuel episode ludacris and lees biodiesel tour buses are running on empty in the middle of the texas panhandle
4298365 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4298366 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4298367 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4298368 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4298369 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4298370 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4298371 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4298372 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it
4298373 im a governor i have with my legislature differences theres that control tension that i think is healthy in a democracy
4298374 i would ask our friends in afscme to join us in our crusade theyre going to keep their jobs theyre going to keep their health care but now start helping us create jobs for other people and provide health care to other people across our state
4298375 theyve completely dropped the ball and have had an awful six years
4298376 they enable him to do the things that hes done over the past six years to put the state in the fiscal crisis that were in today
4298377 they enable him there has to be a political price to pay the voters have got to understand the public has to understand the difference between what we believe in and what they believe in
4298378 even if you thought last night was real it doesnt work
4298379 it is a very small component of a bigger picture that has to be developed and be painted but at the end of the day it doesnt work
4298380 would have to be priced based on the date of the actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge

4298383 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4298384 shut up shut up shut up im sick of this
4298385 and a tipster just spotted caylee again so you guys better frickin quit bugging us
4298386 if you dont want to be knocked down get out of my way
4298387 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4298388 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4298389 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4298390 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4298391 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4298392 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4298393 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4298394 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4298395 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4298396 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4298397 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4298398 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4298399 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4298400 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4298401 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4298402 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4298403 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4298404 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4298405 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4298406 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4298407 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4298408 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4298409 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4298410 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4298411 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4298412 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4298413 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4298414 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4298415 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4298416 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4298417 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4298418 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4298419 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4298420 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4298421 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4298422 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4298423 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
4298424 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
4298425 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
4298426 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
4298427 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
4298428 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
4298429 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
4298430 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
4298431 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
4298432 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
4298433 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4298434 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4298440 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4298441 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4298442 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4298443 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4298444 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4298445 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4298451 ten years after those attacks in kenya and tanzania it appears we have missed the larger lesson of that tragic day and our front line diplomats continue to pay the price as they scramble to respond to the problems of weak states caught up in a vicious and turbulent cycle of collapse they arent the only ones paying the price however as those failed states breed insecurity and conditions favorable for terrorism ten years on the united states still does not have a long term strategy to bring peace and stability to the horn of africa we have tremendous diplomatic military intelligence and foreign assistance resources at our disposal but they are ineffective in the absence of a coordinated and balanced strategy that incorporates both the short and long term goals this is no more evident than in somalia
4298452 defeating the terrorist enemy requires a comprehensive effort executed locally nationally regionally and globally working with partner nations we must eliminate terrorist leadership but incarcerating or killing terrorists will not achieve an end to terrorism we must simultaneously eliminate terrorist safe havens tailoring regional strategies to disaggregate terrorist networks and break terrorist financial travel communications and intelligence links finally and most challenging we must address the underlying conditions that terrorists exploit at the national and local levels to induce alienated or aggrieved populations to become sympathizers supporters and ultimately members of terrorist networks we can marginalize violent extremists by addressing peoples needs and grievances by giving people a stake in their own political future and by providing alternatives to what terrorists offer

4298459 there is no question about the effort put in by the pakistan cricket board and the pakistan government the security plans are outstanding

4298476 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4298477 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4298478 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4298479 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4298480 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4298481 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4298482 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4298483 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get eczema dermatitis rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing

4298524 even though a signal may emanate from the same region deep inside the brain by the time it gets projected to the cortex and the surface of the scalp the signal appears very random we had to come up with a mathematical algorithm to unfold the cortex and match the signal to its source
4298525 we were able to get some consistency around the population to attain a high degree of confidence that it accurately measures an emotional state
4298526 the challenge has been to optimize the number of sensors to get resolution that is needed to allow robust and accurate detection but at the same time not have a swim cap that is hot and uncomfortable

4298536 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4298537 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4298538 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4298539 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4298540 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4298541 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them

4298725 this whole village was covered with unexploded cluster munitions they were on peoples rooftops hanging from trees even in playgrounds
4298726 weve managed to clean up about half of the known cluster munition strike sites in this village we hope to have the whole village completely cleared by the end of the year

4298736 jerk off broke his chins agreement shes having a special meeting
4298737 the grand review turned out to be something so vast so moving that its effect overwhelmed even the generals who organized it it was a beautiful may morning for the first time since lincolns death five weeks earlier the flag at the white house was raised from half mast to the top of the pole
4298738 his men smiled as they saw their uncle billy dressed up after dingy carelessness for years his splendid horse a shining bay was not only perfectly groomed for the occasion but was already covered in flowers at the sound of the signal gun sherman turned up pennsylvania avenue on his flower decked horse
4298739 one observers first impression of shermans troops muskets with fixed bayonets on their shoulders was that these leathery young men their faces made old by war were marching along sullenly but their expressions changed as the successive columns wheeled into pennsylvania avenue and saw what awaited them
4298740 hail champions of belmont donelson shiloh vicksburg chattanooga atlanta savannah bentonville pride of the nation
4298741 shermans progress up pennsylvania avenue was literally triumphal the times said he was vociferously cheered all along the line and added the greeting of this hero was in the highest degree enthusiastic when he rode by raising his hat in answer to the shouts of admiration and welcome people jumped up and down to get a better look at him waving flags and handkerchiefs as they did one spectator caught up in the crowd felt that there was something almost fierce in the fever of enthusiasm a woman journalist observed in his eye the proud conscious glare of the conqueror while his features relieved of the nervous anxious expression of war times assumed an air of repose which well became him shermans soldiers began responding to what sergeant upson of the 100th indiana called one constant roar and upson noted that his troops marched better and better on the faces of the men was what one might call a glory look
4298742 at the head of his sixty five thousand men sherman had a great deal happening in only a few minutes as he rode up the incline to the corner of pennsylvania avenue where he and the leading division of his army would come to the first two turns before passing the reviewing stand in front of the white house sherman gave in to an impulse to look back and see if his soldiers were marching as well as he fervently hoped they were underneath the roar of the crowd he had been hearing behind him what a soldier from minnesota called one footfall a good indication that the men were marching in step but now at the top of this little slope he turned on his horse to see the column of thousands of men that stretched more than a mile behind him down pennsylvania avenue when i reached the treasury building and looked back the sight was simply magnificent the column was compact and the glittering muskets looked like a solid mass of steel moving with the regularity of a pendulum
4298743 sherman was to say in later years that i believe it was the happiest and most satisfactory moment of my life

4298767 you can know something for years and still be wrong and that can be scary like pulling your own rug out from under you

4298783 then noah sends the dove a second time and he never comes back made a nest so noah knew the flood was dry and gone
4298784 why not just look out the window when did this happen

4298852 nona bolehkan aku mendapat tahu she dan namamu yang mulia
4298853 andaikata keponakanku tidak mati di dalam jurang ia juga tidak bisa terlolos dari kebinasaan karena racun dingin itu hai mati jatuh dengan badan remuk memang lebih baik daripada mati disiksa racun
4298854 kalau dia hidup terus ia tak bisa menjadi lain daripada bibit penyakit
4298855 bangsat tua ayah boe kie adalah soeheng dari in liok hiap apakah ayahnya tidak cukup baik
4298856 tapi bagaimana dengan ibunya turunan perempuan siluman dari mo kauw memang tidak bisa menjadi lain daripada bibit penyakit
4298857 isteri thio ngohiap adalah anaknya in thian ceng dari peh bie kauw dia bernama in so so
4298858 sebab menikah dengan perempuan siluman itu nama thio ngohiap menjadi hancur hingga pada akhirnya ia membunuh diri di boe tong san
4298859 kejadian itu diketahui oleh orang sedunia apakah nona tak tahu
4298860 aku berdiam di leng coa to ku tak tahu kejadian dalam rimba persilatan di wilayah tiong goan tapi di manakah adanya in so so sekarang
4298861 in lie heng tee persaudaraan kalian gagal larilah kami akan melindungi dari belakang
4298862 kebinasaan sudah berada di atas kepalamu tapi kau masih bertengkar dengan kawan sendiri
4298863 yang mengenakan pakaian pesuruh adalah budak budaknya in thian ceng
4298864 mereka bernama in boe hok in boe lok dan in boe sioe

4298868 hampir hampir kami celaka sebagian rambut dan alis boh cit tee terbakar
4298869 kali ini kau masih mujur di lain kali janganlah kau jatuh lagi ke dalam tanganku

4298871 ceng soe lekaslah memberi hormat kepada soethay dan para paman
4298872 sejak beberapa lama aku memang sudah mendengar nama besarnya giok bin beng siang dalam kalangan kangouw semua orang memuji song siauw hiap sebagai seorang ksatria yang mulia hatinya aku merasa beruntung bahwa di hari ini aku bisa bertemu dengannya
4298873 coba kau lihat nona cioe mu sedang memandang kau tak sudah sudahnya
4298874 menurut rencana hari ini kira kira tengah hari rombongan khong tong pay akan tiba di sekitar tempat ini
4298875 tapi sampai sekarang mereka belum muncul aku kuatir terjadi sesuatu yang tidak enak
4298876 menurut pendapatku paling baik kita menuju ke barat bersama sama rombongan go bie pay
4298877 memang paling baik jika kita jalan bersama sama para cianpwee dari go bie pay
4298878 sudah kira kira tigapuluh tahun thio sam hong tidak menghiraukan lagi segala urusan dunia dan pada hakekatnya tugas ciangboenjin boe tong pay sudah dipikul seanteronya oleh song wan kiauw lihat lihat gelagatnya kedudukan ciangboenjin ketika dari boe tong pay akan diduduki oleh song siauw hiap sekarang saja sang paman sudah menuruti kemauan si keponakan
4298879 rombongan po yang pang dari propinsi kang say termusnah seanteronya mereka dihancurkan oleh kie bok kie bendera balok besar dari mo kauw
4298880 tapi lauw pang coe dari po yang pang telah diakui sebagai murid khong tong pay mereka rupanya ingin membantu rumah perguruan
4298881 tio leng coe soe siok oey kio boe soe siok pergilah kedudukan lee wie dan memotong larinya musuh
4298882 hah hah di antara orang muda banyak yang lihai dengan mempunyai murid yang lihayiitu biat coat loohie sungguh tidak boleh dibuat permainan
4298883 menurut katanya orang ceng ek hok ong selalu menghisap darah manusia cerita itu ternyata bukan omongan kosong
4298884 kalau kau tahu tidak pantas tak perlu kau membuka mulut
4298885 waktu mengajar ilmu pedang ayahku pernah mengatakan bahwa pada jaman ini orang paling lihai kiam hoatnya di dalam dunia adalah soecouw kami sedang yang kedua ialah biat coat cianpwee kiamhoat boe tong dan go bie masing masing mempunyai keunggulan dan kekurangan misalnya saja pukulan chioe hwie ngo hian tangan menyapu lima kali tetabuhan dari boe tong hampir bersamaan dengan ceng lo siauw san kudung tipis dan kipas kecil dari go bie pay tapi jika chioe hwie ngo hian dikirim dengan menggunakan tenaga yang besar maka kelincahannnya jadi berkurang dan tidak dapat menyamai ceng lo siauw san yang tetap bisa mempertahankan kecepatannya
4298886 pergelangan tanganmu masih sakit dan tidak bisa mengeluarkan banyak tenaga
4298887 ayahku sering mengatakan bahwa ia merasa menyesal belum bisa menyaksikan ilmu pedang gurumu
4298888 a goe koko kalau aku bisa mempunyai ilmu ringan badan setinggi ceng ek hok ong biarpun mati aku merasa rela
4298889 menurut katanya in liok hiap saban kali menggunakan ilmunya wie it siauw harus membunuh manusia perlu apa mempunyai ilmu siluman
4298890 dalam pertempuran manusia saling membunuh kalau tidak membunuh tentu dibunuh
4298891 wie it siauw lihai dan dia berhasil membunuh murid go bie kalau dia kurang lihai bukankan dia sendiri yang bakal dibunuh oleh si niekow tua
4298892 lihatlah di atas pasir hanya terdapat tapak kaki seorang manusia kalau benar kawan kawan khong tong pay menemui musuh yang kita lihat sedikitnya tapak empat atau lima orang
4298893 bagaimana kau tahu bahwa khong tong pay telah bertemu dengan musuh
4298894 anak panah api yang digunakan oleh keenam partai hanya dapat dibuat oleh tukang tukang yang pandai dari tiong goan anak panah begitu tak bisa dibuat oleh tukang tukang daerah see hek
4298895 apakah kau ingin mengatakan bahwa seorang murid kong tong kena tangkap dan anak panah api itu dirampas dari tangannya
4298896 sementara itu pihak siluman telah memancing kita ke timur laut dan kemudian ke barat untuk membuat kita lelah menurut pendapatku mereka berkumpul di sebelah barat daya
4298897 anak panah api itu terang terang telah digunakan memancing musuh
4298898 kukira bahwa biarpun orang orang go bie tak sadar bocah she song itu pasti akan menebak juga aku menduga pada akhirnya kalian semua tentu akan ke sini a goe koko bukankah benar begitu
4298899 kalau kau sudah menduga begitu mengapa tidak cepat cepat memberitahukan kepada kami
4298900 mengapa kau tak minta pendapatku andaikata aku memberitahukan kepada kau kau tentu tak akan percaya kau tentu lebih suka berlari lari ke sana sini
4298901 pihak musuh terdiri dari bendera bendera swie kim emas murni ang soei air besar dan lian hwee
4298902 khong tong pay sudah berada di sini hwa san pay dan koen loen pay juga sudah tiba tiga bendera melawan tiga partai soe jie mari kita turut menyerbu
4298903 kita tunggu sampati datangnya para paman dari go bie pay
4298904 di sebelah sana terdapat sejumlah besar musuh yang sedang menunggu untuk menerjang sewaktu waktu
4298905 biarpun peh bie kauw merupakan cabang dari mo kauw tapi pihak peh bie telah bentrok dengan ciang kie soe dari lima bendera mo kauw maka itu andaikata kalian dapat membasmi musuh diam diam in thian ceng pasti akan merasa girang sebab dengan demikian ia mempunyai kesempatan untuk menduduki kursi kauwcoe dari mo kauw
4298906 dalam mengatur barisan kami tidak menandingi kau sekarang kau harus memimpin kami dan kami akan menaati semua perintah demi kepentingan bersama jangan kau berlaku sungkan
4298907 dengan mengepalai beberapa paman soethay menyerang dari tenggara liok siok menyerbu dari barat sedangkan ceng hie soe siok dan boanpwee sendiri akan menerjang dari barat daya
4298908 koen loen pay sudah berada di atas angin dan jika kita membantu dalam sekejap kita akan dapat membasmi seluruh swie kim kie
4298909 sesudah swie kim kie dikalahkan kedua bendera yang lain pasti akan mundur sendirinya sebaliknya kalau kita menolong khong tong kita harus melakukan pertempuran yang hebat dan lama bagaimana kalau dengan kesempatan itu peh bie kauw menyerbu dan mengurung dari berbagai jurusan
4298910 asal usulmu sangat mengherankan kau tak bisa pergi begitu saja
4298911 hari ini kita membuka larangan membunuh untuk membasmi bersih kawanan siluman
4298912 chung kie soe telah berpulang ke alam baka swie kim dan liat hwee mundur ang soei kie melindungi diri dari belakang
4298913 ini adalah perintah dari ang soei kie para anggota swie kim kie mundurlah usaha membalas sakit hati chung kie soe dapat dilaksanakan di hari nanti

4298919 saudara saudara koen loen go bie hwa san dan khong tong mundurlah sepuluh langkah
4298920 celaka benar bila kita jatuh ke tangan peh bie kauw
4298921 aku tak bisa bertemu lagi dengan ibu kapankah aku bisa bertemu dengan kakek dan paman
4298922 ah biar bagaimanapun juga aku harus melihat apakah kakek dan paman berada dalam pasukan itu
4298923 cepatlah mengambil keputusan terhadap orang orang swie kim kie supaya kita bisa segera menghadapi peh bie kauw
4298924 hei orang orang mo kauw kamu dengarlah siapa yang masih ingin hidup bisa mendapatkan pengampunan asal saja meminta ampun
4298925 dengan chung toako kami ingin hidup dan mati bersama sama
4298926 tapi kau jangan mimpi bahwa kau bisa mampus dengan enak
4298927 beng kauw mewakili langit menjalankan keadilan membereskan dunia menolong rakyat dan kami menganggap bahwa hidup atau mati tiada bedanya
4298928 bangsat tua jika kau mengharap takluknya kami maka seperti mimpi di siang bolong
4298929 apa kau tak malu sudah menyakiti sesama manusia secara begitu kejam
4298930 semua orang ingin membinasakan kawanan siluman yang sesat dalam hal ini tak ada soal kejam atau tidak kejam
4298931 para cian pwee dan toako ini adalah orang orang yang berkepribadian luhur dan tidak takut mati
4298932 sikap mereka sikap ksatria tulen bagaimana kau bisa menganggap mereka sebagai kawanan siluman yang sesat
4298933 dengan matamu sendiri kau telah menyaksikan bagaimana ceng ek hong ong membunuh manusia dan menghisap darahnya dia sudah membunuh soate dan soemayku kalau itu bukan siluman apa yang bisa dinamakan siluman
4298934 ceng ek hok ong hanya membunuh dua orang tapi kamu sudah membinasakan sepuluh kali dua orang
4298935 dia menggunakan gigi gurumu menggunakan ie thian kiam dia membunuh gurumupun membunuh apa bedanya
4298936 selama beberapa hari aku tidak memperhatikan dia dan tak disangka dia seorang yang berkepandaian tinggi aku sendiripun belum tentu bisa melemparkan ceng hie dengan cara begitu dalam dunia mungkin thio sam hong yang memiliki lweekang sedemikian dahsyat
4298937 bolehkah aku mengetahui she dan nama siauw hiap yang mulia
4298938 biat coat soethay aku bukan tandinganmu aku sama sekali tak berniat untuk bertanding sama loo jinke panggilan menghormati untuk seorang yang tua aku hanya berharap supaya kedua belah pihak menghentikan pertempuran dan mengadakan perdamaian

4298982 la realidad es que en todas las reas la unidad dios la respalda y en estos momentos de dolor nos olvidamos pr cticamente de los cargos de los equipos simplemente somos humanos con necesidades con sue os con fortalezas con debilidades pero con una sola fe pidi ndole a dios que tenga todo bajo control
4298983 hay que esperar un poco para que realice esfuerzos mayores
4298984 l brindisi inici desde hace unos d as con unos s ntomas que aparentemente eran de malestar general pero ayer se identific un problema c lico renal que no tiene ninguna complicaci n pero necesita un manejo de reposo y unos medicamentos dentro de la vena y hay que esperar un poco para que realice esfuerzos mayores
4298985 po ah el profe brindisi nos ha puesto en el cuadro titular y ojal se d la posibilidad como todo jugador espera este tipo de oportunidades y si por ah juego hay que aprovecharla
4298986 estoy tranquilo sabemos que ser un partido complicado pero nosotros debemos de sacar la victoria pues venimos de dos derrotas por ah hubo varias bajas de compa eros y no queda m s que aprovechar la oportunidad para ganar de a poco la titularidad
4298987 como cualquier delantero tengo la ilusi n de anotar el primer gol y ojal se pueda dar el s bado
4298988 me gust porque nos presentamos con autoridad siempre con la intenci n de ir a atacar el arco contrario tuvimos mucha solidez en la defensa pero nos sigue faltando ese segundo gol nos pas lo mismo ante cruz azul monterrey y contra toluca
4298989 tenemos que meter el segundo gol o tercero para manejar el partido de una mejor manera afortunadamente la defensa se mostr serena con seguridad y pudimos sacar la victoria ya encontramos el camino y vamos en ascenso
4298990 si depende de m har todo lo posible para poder estar
4298991 no s lo que piensa l de mi parte si depende de m har todo lo posible para poder estar y lo dem s lo decidir el t cnico la parte del jugador ser muy importante y siempre lo es as que una recuperaci n depende de c mo se sienta cada uno y si me toca dar mi opini n creo que ser positiva de acuerdo a c mo he ido evolucionando y creo que el s bado puedo llegar bastante bien y m s porque queda todav a ma ana y gran parte del s bado
4298992 temor nunca he tenido si entro con miedo algo me pasar me gustan los partidos duros y no tengo problema si es duro o no no me quita el sue o para jugar lo que voy a evaluar es si estoy bien hay que estar a la orden del t cnico tambi n
4298993 lo que quiero es acompa ar a mis compa eros es un momento dif cil y quiero aportar lo que pueda aportar y disponer todo de m y estar a la orden en un momento como ste siempre quiero estar y aunque no est al 100 por ciento intentar que en mi cabeza sea positiva y que voy a dar el 100 por ciento
4298994 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4298995 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4298996 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4298997 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4298998 because of changed circumstances its believed another five years of transitional support is required and assistance required to achieve that long term sustainable case for the industry itself
4298999 one of the most competitive open automotive industries in the country will occur here as a result of those moves
4299000 there have been enormous changes locally and globally since the industry was last reviewed
4299001 this container was targetted as a result of intelligence that came out of an operation by the new south wales crime commission
4299002 lejos de meternos nervio el enfrentar al superl der nos tiene que motivar porque por ah les ganamos y eso nos reforzar bastante nosotros somos los principales culpables de que estemos as por ah ante cruz azul dejamos escapar la victoria pero ahora eso no se puede corregir ante san luis tenemos que quedarnos con los tres puntos como sea
4299003 somos conscientes de que los partidos que hemos jugado contra ellos ya pasaron la estad sticas quedan de lado y lo nico que importa son los 90 minutos que vienen
4299004 vamos a ganar y vamos a demostrar que nosotros tenemos la raz n es il gico que demanden a un comprador por haber comprado muy bien en lo que su demanda est basada es en que ofrec demasiado dinero por chivas entonces es medio il gico pero va a pasar y vamos a ganar
4299005 no hubo nada fueron seis horas de en balde porque no asistieron algunos testigos que no fueron notificados y estuvimos esperando nada m s es parte del proceso pero obviamente que va a tenerse que volver a realizar la prueba
4299006 no para nada estoy desgastado hoy nos divertimos adem s que con el triunfo de anoche de chivas ante toluca 1 0 no me desgasta nada
4299007 es repetir lo que ya sucedi ya escuch la grabaci n ya acept que soy yo el que est en la junta informativa de esa asamblea as que no les va a cambiar el panorama
4299008 es bastante est pido lo que dicen porque de todos modos en quince d as o tres semanas 11 de septiembre tenemos que volver a fuerzas otra vez entonces ser a yo medio tonto estar viniendo a calentar silla nada m s aqu creo que para desgracia de ellos no han podido notificar a algunos de ellos y es falta de ellos es falta de la parte opositora que notifiquen y logren encontrar a la gente que falta por venir
4299009 si l est en la cancha es porque el riesgo no existe
4299010 seguimos en la misma pol tica s est evolucionando bien ha trabajado bien pero no podemos y ser a muy apresurado de cualquiera de las partes confirmar que gonzalo va a estar en la cancha seguimos esperando la evoluci n de su inestabilidad con respecto a la fuerza muscular estamos muy bien con respecto al dolor estamos muy bien y s existe la molestia al patear pero tenemos que esperar la evoluci n de la estabilidad de la rodilla para el d a s bado
4299011 nosotros estamos haciendo todo lo posible para que gonzalo est a la disposici n de miguel pero tenemos que esperar a que llegue el d a s bado y ah hacer las pruebas y evaluaciones necesarias para ver si gonzalo puede estar contra san luis nos hab amos planeado tres semanas de tratamiento y la gran predisposici n al trabajo de el jugador y la tolerancia al dolor sigue haciendo que podamos acelerar los tiempos esperando a que cumpliera las dos semanas pero dependemos de una evaluaci n
4299012 ganar sobre todo la nica manera que esto cambie es con un triunfo tendremos un partido en casa entonces por obligaci n y por convicci n propia creo que en el nimo de todos est el ganar el pr ximo 23 de agosto para que de una vez rompamos esa racha y sobre todo ahora intentar tener una racha pero positiva en relaci n a partidos ganados
4299013 como entrenador yo asumo toda mi responsabilidad no rehuyo a sta pero yo creo que la directiva se da cuenta de que todo lo que estamos haciendo es lo necesario y lo correcto para tener al equipo en otras circunstancias l gico ahora los resultados no avalan sta o no respaldan pero hay plena confianza de revertir esta situaci n
4299014 s lo falta ganar y con eso se arregla todo obviamente que la presi n en el futbol siempre est cuando est s arriba cuando est s abajo cuando est s en medio la presi n en el futbol la vas llevando de lado as que ahora en este momento es cuando tienen que salir los referentes del plantel a echarse el equipo al hombro y sacarlo adelante

4299035 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4299036 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4299037 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4299038 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4299039 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4299040 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4299041 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests

4299064 the video indicated that the vien duong appeared to collide or very nearly collide with a killer whale while continuing to manoeuvre around other members of the pod at full speed and in close proximity
4299065 i dont want to sound apologetic but you know it could happen to anybody however once you find yourself amongst killer whales the law clearly requires us to take evasive action where possible

4299073 what does it take to make the world listen and respond it takes a number of important tools including diplomacy financial resources and effective security forces and in a world where these resources are finite it often takes pressure pressure from ordinary individuals standing together for an extraordinary cause to mobilize these resources in short it takes you

4299388 initiatives must be focused and sustainable designed to create jobs and genuine growth
4299389 it is important to present the effects of global warming in a local context
4299390 the team must have a common understanding of how receding coastlines mean threats to our food security and that resource scarcity is our personal and professional business they must be aware of the reasons behind hotel initiatives in order to be fully committed to their goals
4299391 our associates and leadership team at the courtyard fort myers have worked hard to achieve this important designation
4299392 the practices implemented through the programs comprehensive requirements help us to run our hotels more efficiently and cost effectively but more importantly help us to preserve our states precious natural resources we now have one third of our florida properties that have achieved green lodging status and we are fully committed to earn this important designation at all twenty seven of our properties in florida as well as incorporating green lodging practices in all of our hotels throughout the southeast

4299397 knowing how to speak doesnt mean knowing how to write
4299398 and seeing something doesnt mean you know how to pronounce it
4299399 he is your friend your partner your defender your dog you are his life his love his leader he will be yours faithful and true to the last beat of his heart you owe it to him to be worthy of such devotion
4299400 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4299401 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4299402 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4299403 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first instalment
4299404 when times are good the employer would be rewarding its employees and if times are bad which we dont foresee for a while then they wouldnt have to pay
4299405 this industry is going to be highballing for a considerable amount of time and we see that management wants to keep all the money to themselves
4299406 they have a great deal and one of the real keys in life is knowing when you have a good deal
4299407 the one thing that we wont do is destroy our cost structure
4299408 we will not become a high cost producer of potash we dont want to end up like one of the airlines or a detroit auto maker
4299409 the company has advertised how successful they are which is clearly the case and therefore labour is simply saying they are part of that success
4299410 three months ago this news would have sent fertilizer stocks flying
4299411 i never thought of myself as a curvy girl but after trying on
4299412 that particular hoodie hooded tank dress by complex geometries is sold out at
4299413 yeah most of those words have been used for hundreds of years
4299414 the courts installed video technology apparently had not been used for anything like this before
4299415 we had the opportunity to go with a newer more advanced system but in tests the older technology was actually more reliable
4299416 we decided to be proactive and not wait and be reactionary
4299417 its casting the problem in a language clients actually use and letting them know you have expertise in this area
4299418 its a way to package the firm but it isnt just that
4299419 this involves language and concepts related to financial institutions that dont exist anywhere else
4299420 more often than not there is in every case a cardinal point around which lesser points revolve like planets around the sun or even as dead moons around a planet a central fortress which if strongly held will make the loss of all the outworks immaterial
4299421 it was difficult for his adversary to persuade the court that there was anything else worthy to be considered
4299422 in our view the patent offensiveness of the stupid fag comment renders it quite similar to the comment made to the plaintiff in taylor
4299423 in our view the record showed that givas had no actual knowledge of plaintiff at all either his prior work history or his conduct on the day in question
4299424 all of that information was supplied by wonder moreover because wonder agreed with the decision to terminate wonders influence on the whole process here may have been quite substantial
4299425 merrill lynch cannot avoid liability for that discrimination by assigning the ultimate decision to terminate plaintiff to someone who had no knowledge of the discrimination where that ultimate decisionmaker failed to undertake her own independent investigation
4299426 the fact that it was made by plaintiffs immediate supervisor should be enough because as taylor itself noted a supervisor is someone who should be protecting the employee from such conduct in the workplace
4299427 at the very least plaintiff would have had genuine reason to question wonder every time she criticized his work and evaluated his performance and to wonder whether the criticism was valid or instead was generated by her bias against gay men
4299428 the desirability of regulating punitive damages as a common law remedy for which responsibility lies with this court as a source of judge made law in the absence of statute
4299429 exceeds the bounds justified by the punitive damages goal of deterring reckless or worse behavior and the consequently heightened threat of harm
4299430 suggest ed that in many instances a high ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is substantially greater than necessary to punish and deter
4299431 pegging punitive to compensatory damages using a ratio or maximum multiple
4299432 a 1 1 ratio which is above the median award is a fair upper limit
4299433 whether a plaintiff asserting a rico claim predicated on mail fraud must plead and prove that it relied on the defendants alleged misrepresentations
4299434 none of this is to say that a rico plaintiff who alleges injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone relied on the defendants misrepresentations
4299435 a federal statute that prohibits states from enacting any law related to a motor carrier price route or service pre empts two provisions of a maine tobacco law which regulate the delivery of tobacco to customers within the state
4299436 transportation rates routes and services that reflect maximum reliance on competitive market forces
4299437 id at 995 the court then examined whether the maine statute conflicted with that goal
4299438 a states direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces
4299439 federal law does not pre empt a states efforts to protect its citizens public health particularly when those laws regulate so dangerous an activity as underage smoking
4299440 because they regulate within a zone protected and reserved for market freedom
4299441 californias policy judgment that partisan employer speech necessarily interfere s with an employees choice about whether to join or to be represented by a labor union
4299442 to effect a radical curtailment of state common law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices
4299443 when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum whether judicial or administrative are superseded by the faa
4299444 rub too much against the grain of the 9 language where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility
4299445 a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitrations essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway
4299446 merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time consuming judicial review process
4299447 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4299448 obviously weve called on both sides to cease the fighting and i gather a ceasefire now appears to be taking hold but we do call on russia to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
4299449 the government of canada is deeply concerned for the welfare of those affected by the violence in south ossetia
4299450 in response to an emergency appeal by the red cross canada will contribute to international efforts to alleviate the suffering of those on the ground by providing basic needs such as safe water supplies and emergency medical care
4299451 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
4299452 we note with regret the statement made by the oic secretary general on the situation in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
4299453 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus stand we reject such comments
4299454 the ongoing excessive and unwarranted use of force against the kashmiri people

4299515 sometime when i wasnt doing music for six months dennis came along and picked up on the band and stole them from me
4299516 the next time i was ready to do a concert i called up my band master and he said we cant play because were going to an undisclosed location in the persian gulf on an aircraft carrier playing for the troops
4299517 thats how i found out dennis had my band and i had to go and get another band and train them all over again
4299518 dennis is an old friend of mine were like family friends
4299519 the residents in south lebanon who are under the responsibility of hezbollah will be hit harder
4299520 in less hectic days we saw how the israeli government plants the idea that somehow an event did not happen as widely reported
4299521 olmert hezbollah used qana as base to launch 100s of rockets
4299522 beirut shall always be free free hariri get the hell out
4299523 after rices latest statements the mood seems to have changed in the country an uncle of mine who was middle of the road and was blaming hezbollah now is saying that it is clear that this is a us israel plan to destroy the country a friend of mine with kataeb leanings has said the same
4299524 hizbullah is ratcheting up its kill ratio with the israeli military toward 1 1 something no other arab fighting force has even approached
4299525 for the second time in eight days the israelis committed a war crime yesterday they ordered the villagers of taire near the border to leave their homes and then as their convoy of cars and minibuses obediently trailed northwards the israeli air force fired a missile into the rear minibus killing three refugees and seriously wounding 13 other civilians the rocket that killed them is believed to have been a hellfire missile made by lockheed martin in florida
4299526 is it possible is it conceivable that israel is losing its war in lebanon
4299527 the israelis are radicalising lebanon even liberal democrats like me i took part in last years demonstrations against syria i was a critic of hizbullah now i cannot help but support hizbullahs fighters who are defending our country
4299528 its not only lebanese who should have to suffer are human rights available only to israelis you cant have winter and summer on the same roof
4299529 general adam who met reporters in a pine forest at dusk acknowledged that after two days of bitter combat that had left 10 soldiers dead bint jbail was still not under israeli control
4299530 two days ago israeli military officials on the border confidently announced that first the village of marun al ras and then the larger town of bint jbail had been subdued but renewed fighting erupted in the region around daybreak wednesday and by afternoon military officers were being more circumspect about their progress in the village of marun al ras one israeli soldier was killed and three more were wounded wednesday the israeli military said hezbollah fighters fired an anti tank rocket that hit the soldiers in a building it said
4299531 las razones para cambiar la pel cula al verano son dos sabemos que el verano es la temporada ideal para los lanzamientos familiares lo cual comprobamos con la ltima entrega de harry potter que se convirti en la segunda m s taquillera de esta franquicia s lo despu s de la primera parte
4299532 adem s como todos los dem s estudios seguimos sintiendo las repercusiones de la huelga de escritores que impact la entrega de los guiones de otras pel culas cambiando totalmente el escenario competitivo de 2009 y abriendo nuevos espacios de oportunidad que queremos aprovechar as acordamos que la mejor estrategia era mover el misterio del pr ncipe a julio y con ello llenar perfectamente el hueco que podr a haber a la mitad del verano
4299533 el cambio de fecha no modifica el calendario de producci n de las pr ximas pel culas de harry potter la posproducci n de el pr ncipe mestizo se termin a tiempo y los planes de lanzamiento de harry potter y las reliquias de la muerte en dos partes no se ver n afectadas con esto
4299534 sabemos que los fans est n esperando ansiosos por ver estos ltimos cap tulos en la pantalla grande de hecho la buena noticia para ellos es que ahora el tiempo de espera entre el misterio del pr ncipe y las reliquias de la muerte ser menor
4299535 cuando jeff robinov explic la l gica de mover de fecha la pel cula a julio de 2009 fue obvio que esto nos ofrecer a el potencial de llegar a un p blico m s amplio
4299536 todos estamos esperando compartirla con los fans de harry potter de todo el mundo incluso si tenemos que esperar un poco m s
4299537 ha sido una gran alegr a trabajar en el misterio del pr ncipe dan rupert emma y todo el resto del elenco siguen madurando mientras que los nuevos actores le han tra do color y vida a hogwarts mientras le damos los toques finales a la pel cula estamos preparando ya las siguientes empezaremos a filmar en febrero y estoy muy emocionado de llevar esta incre ble serie hasta el final emocionante que sus fans merecen
4299538 according to the lebanese police force the two israeli soldiers were captured in lebanese territory in the area of aitaa al chaab near the border with israel where an israeli unit had penetrated in the middle of morning
4299539 only weeks ago an entire reserve division was drafted in order to train for an operation such as this
4299540 we will leave iran to the world community and syria as well its very important to understand that we are not instilling world order
4299541 while the world focuses on the smouldering conflict in the middle east the wars instigator and puppeteer iran must be pretty darn pleased with itself while iranian backed hezbollah jolts israeli cities with rockets and israeli forces ferret out terrorist militants across lebanon iran has suffered nary a nick verbally or otherwise moreover tehran was skilfully able to keep its atomic aspirations out of the limelight at the g 8 summit in st petersburg russia but when the current clash ultimately subsides the international community especially the middle east should turn its attention to tehrans treachery and expose iran for what it is a serious threat to regional stability
4299542 if israel makes a land entry into lebanon they can get to within 20km of damascus
4299543 any lebanese citizens christians or muslims who want to defend their land lebanon are welcomed
4299544 israel should be held accountable for the crimes it committed in lebanon and should be tried for having violated international law
4299545 but unfortunately with no result he said that this makes the lebanese think that there might be something behind that and perhaps they want to give more time to israel to hit more thinking that maybe hezbollah will give up
4299546 part of those terrorist attacks are inspired by nation states like syria and iran and in order to be able to deal with this crisis the world must deal with hezbollah with syria and to continue to work to isolate iran
4299547 israel will not emerge as a victor in this war it will only create more enemies
4299548 today the global axis of evil the u s a the zionists israelis and britain are showing their true colors of world devouring and exploitation through their occupation and the killing of defenseless people
4299549 the war is part of the american greater middle east initiative which the u s government is striving to materialize
4299550 iran has made a laughing stock of the world community
4299551 since world war two i havent seen such a situation of international weakness
4299552 arab countries decided not to use this oil weapon again
4299553 however complicated the questions are maximum efforts must be applied to resolve the situation in a peaceful way and i think all efforts have not been exhausted however it is our impression that aside from seeking to return the abducted soldiers israel is pursuing wider goals
4299554 that an axis of aggression links tel aviv and washington with london at the midpoint and it has tehran in its sights
4299555 that lebanon if destroyed every bridge in israel blew up the international airport seized the airspace and turned it into a free fire zone blockaded the ports severed every arterial road and ordered people to leave their homes then bombing them to pieces when they did
4299556 no one should be in any doubt why george bush and blair want israel to continue its assault on lebanon and they are intervening to quell international condemnation of the attack
4299557 i can for example publish an order that no material can be published i can close a newspaper or shut down a station i can do almost anything
4299558 while i agree with you if i say anything about us geopolitical interests with israel i might as well clean off my desk

4299564 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4299565 what were seeing is people losing their feeling for the other people in their lives they stop caring about their husbands or wives or children they stop caring about life and god
4299566 seems to deprive people of the essence of their personality if you are at all observant you can tell right away if you are dealing with someone whos on prozac if you yourself are taking prozac you know this zombie like feeling at the core of your soul initially you may feel this numbness as an improvement over depression but you know it can hardly be considered healthy the side effects of prozac are far more serious than just the addiction to it of all the drugs ive ever cautioned people against prozac is the one which terrifies me most

4299570 anyone who has worked road patrol for any length of time can speak on the unusual and disturbing things that are seen on a daily basis during routine traffic stops said detective sgt
4299571 this incident would definitely fall under the disturbing side of things
4299572 challenges and dangers have taken place in the palestinian arena recently which affect the very essence of whatever it is that we call
4299573 the truce hasnt ended the blockade and there is a large resentment of continuation of such a situation
4299574 i will tell them that we spent 30 years persuading palestinians to accept a two state solution and if we do not succeed in achieving it we will return to the idea of one state
4299575 its not the maps that specify our stance but vice versa
4299576 some people say that fatah is a movement of the old guard i say that 80 of fatah is from the young generation holding the sixth conference will unify the movement reunite its leaders with the fatah base and enable a rapprochement between fatah leaders and affiliates it is not true that members of the fatah central committee are reluctant to hold the conference on the contrary they are working very hard for its success
4299577 whenever israel proposes a new map i feel as if they are taking part of my flesh the negotiations are very difficult sometimes we shout at each other or exchange curses

4299585 it is huge for him to reach out like this
4299586 this helps with everything it shows him what he can do there are no boundaries and he is smiling from ear to ear he uses the same sign language that he uses in his regular education program
4299587 it means we can operate a full time equestrian facility

4299589 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the indian economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 per cent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
4299590 according to our assessment despite a slowdown in the last six months the interest of the nris has increased almost by 20 25 every quarter that is almost two to two and a half times in the last two to three years
4299591 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
4299592 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property in india while investors from uk and usa are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from
4299593 the property price upswing seen in the indian market has made nris very bullish about the indian real estate nri segment contributes to about 25 30 investment both for the end use and for investment
4299594 many nris have shown keen interest in luxury homes in places like khar bandra and powai due to their vicinity to the airport also there has been interest in projects in kandivali and borivali for many maharashtrians abroad pune is the preferred location for investment many a times a crisis situation in their country brings them to other countries for investment

4299597 we do call on russia to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
4299598 i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4299599 clearly it would be inappropriate in the circumstances based on russias breach of territorial integrity in georgia
4299600 its important to stand strong with our allies in sending a message that based on that type of aggressive behaviour we will not participate in that exercise
4299601 its a message that says the world is noticing your actions
4299602 in my judgment this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4299603 you can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed
4299604 clearly the effort is to collect more information about peoples noncriminal behaviors
4299605 terrorism is a crime if we focus on the criminal aspects of it there would be no need to change the law
4299606 weve got like nine tournaments left or something like that theres so much golf to be played i just want to play some solid golf and see what happens
4299607 everything was pretty good ive been striking the ball really well and now im starting to score with it
4299608 ive been feeling like its been coming for the last six or seven weeks like something good might happen
4299609 the main thing was getting off to a good start with birdies on the first three holes that set the pace and got me a good feeling out there
4299610 ive been hitting it pretty good but i feel like ive been leaving a few shots out there
4299611 id say i was just a lot more efficient today
4299612 ive learned that sometimes i need to take a more conservative approach
4299613 its playing smarter than you think you should sometimes i play too aggressive at times when you do that there are days you get away with it and there are days you dont when you dont you wind up making some big numbers i just havent gotten away with it this year
4299614 we gave money to the schools for a support staff raise a few years ago
4299615 they moved that money to another area to use it somewhere else they were going to absorb that into their cafeteria budget they asked us to refund that back so they would not have to take it out of their cafeteria budget but i felt we funded it once and they moved it somewhere else then wed be funding that particular thing twice
4299616 there is a 30 000 amount of money in the budget that was originally cut out of the budget when it looked like we were going to have to make even more major cuts than we did when we placed that money back into the budget i think some folks thought they had given us that money twice
4299617 the deal with the two new teachers we were not aware of that when we met on monday night
4299618 if there is a problem there im sure well get back with the school board and get this straightened out
4299619 if the budget gets in trouble later on im sure the county commission will step up and help us out they always have in the past and always will in the future
4299620 i am very excited especially at this stage in my life to have an entirely new adventure to be anticipating
4299621 i always kept my age a closely guarded secret but now i am very proud to be announcing it i guess that happens when you get a little niche that you can claim
4299622 they really arent ready to retire in their spirits and so this gives them an opportunity to use the skills they have acquired in their lifetime and really help someone help themselves
4299623 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back
4299624 pressure was felt and that was the important thing a lot of things happened throughout the negotiations ups and downs that was just a way for us to put more pressure and we knew it would work at the end of the day
4299625 the teams lease expires in a year and if theres no new building theres no way this club can have any future in pittsburgh
4299626 it needs to resolve itself in the next couple of months otherwise theyre going to have to look at options
4299627 wednesday will be a turning point in the franchises future we decide the fate of the franchise after wednesday we will sit down and evaluate all of our options
4299628 this indicates a crisis in education for our black children these results tell us we must redouble our efforts
4299629 free speech is the right to shout theater in a crowded fire
4299630 we had a really staggered preparation after the european championship
4299631 there is little coordination between different sections of the team
4299632 i like the brew crew stuff but how about some love for my beloved milwaukee bucks
4299633 ha nobody likes the bucks anymore pal in fact nobody likes the nba anymore
4299634 there are reasons to be excited about work that will be done over the next few years
4299635 how come it was ok for the usa to invade iraq and grenada and panama to effectuate regime change but its now suddenly not ok for russia to do the same thing how come it was ok for the usa to bomb serbia into accepting the dismemberment of its country but it is not ok for russia to attack georgia for the same reason
4299636 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4299637 we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces
4299638 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4299639 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4299640 we sincerely apologize for the error that resulted in fenway park being unavailable to host the 2009 acc baseball championship
4299641 the atlantic coast conference and its baseball championship are very important to us and we are truly sorry for this situation
4299642 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
4299643 in terms of this years event we are moving swiftly to find a quality venue to host one of our premiere conference championships
4299644 and i think john mccain is someone we should be excited about on both these fronts
4299645 knowing my father he will be running circles around the rest of us in a matter of weeks
4299646 for as he thinks in his heart so is he
4299647 the question is do we think it will remain that way for the rest of the year or not
4299648 it is a way to have an immediate positive impact on the price of oil
4299649 he taught me that everyone is responsible for themselves but its what you do for your community and country that defines you
4299650 was the first person who showed me that you can enter politics and hold onto your integrity and continue to be a straight talker
4299651 but weve been let down year after year after year by the people in washington
4299652 vague generalities will not win the day in washington d c
4299653 if you are driving go north from noksapyeong station turn left at the first stop light and look for parking
4299654 the labour market should be completely opened up and by 457 programs right across the board or certainly if not right across the board down to areas that i would call semi skilled such as truck drivers
4299655 for zions sake i will not keep silent for jerusalems sake i will not remain quiet till her righteousness shines out like the dawn her salvation like a blazing torch
4299656 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you 8 for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened
4299657 this is one of the places that robin gets to go to have that kind of fun a kind of independence that she normally doesnt get i just cant imagine its just awful
4299658 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4299659 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4299660 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4299661 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago

4299663 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4299664 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4299665 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality

4299672 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape

4299674 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4299675 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4299682 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4299683 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4299684 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4299685 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4299686 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4299687 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4299688 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4299689 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
4299690 we know that when storms or other natural disasters occur they do not respect political boundaries we have to be prepared to work in praetorship
4299691 take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves

4299698 well you know the derogatory statements about certain races our races or whatever and when we went up to the stair well they had derogatory statements like they wanted us to go home
4299699 i dont believe so we dont have any evidence of that
4299700 theres things written about women theres things written about hispanics theres things written about blacks so but thats something thats common but the spirit of the hill is been more about cooperation than anything
4299701 you know on a construction site of four hundred people is there going to be a little bit of tension from time to time yeah and we see that thats not out of the normal but nothing thats unusual of any type

4299786 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4299787 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4299788 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4299789 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4299790 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4299791 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4299792 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4299793 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

4299797 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4299798 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4299799 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4299800 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4299801 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4299802 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4299803 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

4299805 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4299806 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

4299862 theres an overwhelming need and were just wanting to make a dent in it and help as many kids as we can

4299887 mas mabilis lang siguro yung pagtanggap ko sa sarili ko ng mga pangyayari pupuwedeng kay sharon ay iba ang epekto ng mga bagay bagay kaya nga sabi ko every individual is different siguro ay hindi pa lang talaga panahon kaya nga may kanya kanyang time ang lahat kung medyo natatagalan tayo kina shawie at gabby darating din yan lets pray and wait
4299888 iyan naman ang bentahe ng may marunong magkusa at umintindi sa isyu sa showbiz kasi ang yabang ng isa ay puwedeng maging isang simpleng biro lang ng iba yung iba naman imbes na patulan pa ire reverse psychology na lang nila kahit masakit kaya again nagiging positive ang resulta
