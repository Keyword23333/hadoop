7070000 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
7070001 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq
7070002 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7070003 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7070004 it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7070005 i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start
7070006 i could never have expected this to be as colourful and had the reception it has
7070007 they the crowd were cheerful they were amazed they were intrigued and thats the whole point of pride
7070008 we got a good message across and people had a good time
7070009 sport is this great arena for drama its a reflection of life
7070010 it came as a shock to a lot of his close friends
7070011 i only saw them four times a year and they were a loving couple
7070012 our last event attracted several hundred buyers and we sold 37 cars for a 65 conversion which we are very pleased with a number of cars sold for well above their estimate which suggests there is a ready market for interesting and unusual vehicles despite the current economic conditions
7070013 looking back to the years i travelled i realized that still i will have to go a long way
7070014 the goal of education is not to give you a job but to broaden and to revolutionized your way of thinking
7070015 ich k nnte mir sehr gut vorstellen dass angesichts der aufgaben die vor georgien liegen ein treffen auf einer bestimmten ebene der eu mit den nachbarschaftsstaaten stattfinden k nnte
7070016 nach den uns vorliegenden informationen hat russland seinen r ckzug aus georgien begonnen aber nicht vollst ndig abgeschlossen
7070017 ich trete nicht zur wahl f r das amt des vizepr sidenten an
7070018 ich w rde nicht annehmen wenn ich das angebot erhalten sollte ich w rde lieber vorsitzender des au enpolitischen ausschusses bleiben als vizepr sident zu werden
7070019 to make their most grateful acknowledgments to their friends and customers for the many favours and civilities they have received and hope by this union they will be enabled to carry on their business to the entire satisfaction of their friends as on their part the strictest assiduity and attention shall be observed
7070020 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7070021 that is why i felt it was right for me to submit the resignation to the governor
7070022 zardari est de acuerdo con ser el candidato a la presidencia
7070023 i am very excited olympic gold and record what more could i want
7070024 i had just enough energy to make the break i did that for the people of ethiopia
7070025 i came here as the underdog because of the times i ran so far this year
7070026 its been a good night for kenya we have done something good here for our country
7070027 i knew she jamal would be very strong and i had to work hard to win
7070028 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7070029 the coalition partners were informed about this decision and we are optimistic that the coalition will remain intact
7070030 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7070031 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7070032 unable to check for purchases an unknown error occurred 1001
7070033 there was a problem downloading iphone development introduction iphone tech talks apple developer connection an unknown error occurred 8003 please check that the connection to the network is active and try again
7070034 the coalition partners were informed about this decision and we are optimistic that the coalition will remain intact
7070035 zardari has accepted the pakistan peoples partys unanimous drafting of him and he will be the candidate of the pakistan peoples party
7070036 it should be someone who is a national figure has national stature and is non partisan
7070037 the 30 year olds showed a huge range of grips 20 the over 40s group all had a uniform tripod grip
7070038 between the amount of sodium a person consumes and heart disease circulatory disorders stroke and even early death
7070039 all this hue and cry about eating salt is unnecessary
7070040 for most of us it probably doesnt make much difference how much salt we eat
7070041 so a recommendation that the whole population should avoid salt makes no sense
7070042 we do not know whether increased sodium consumption causes hypertension
7070043 salt is the no 1 natural component of all human tissue and the idea that you dont need it is wrong unless your doctor has proven that you have a salt related health problem there is no reason to give it up
7070044 use more desks for new accounts and take all the staff you can spare to man them
7070045 you realize we cant possibly process all these people today and however many we do will tie us up completely
7070046 thats what someone has in mind just hurry the processing all you can
7070047 economic development will inevitably generate industrial waste which in turn will cause pollution to the living environment economic prosperity and a clean environment can not coexist you have to make a choice between the two
7070048 nos ha salido el 500 de nuestra vida hemos hecho la regata como la hemos plateado siempre y ha salido el d a que ten a que salir
7070049 dos medallas de plata no se ganan todos los d as

7070051 espa a no gan la final de milagro mi equipo es un grupo tremendo de jugadores y personas que lo ha dado todo y no se puede hacer m s

7070054 con el hombre m s r pido de la historia
7070055 igual estoy m s feliz que kenenisa bekele porque sali de la eliminatoria con el nimo muy bajo porque fue desastrosa y pens que no iba a pasar pero he corrido m s relajado m s a ni nivel sin excederme y por eso he conseguido esta buena plaza
7070056 iniciar un nuevo proyecto con el marat n que es lo que quiero y lo que busco
7070057 esto igual son destellos de entusiasmo hay que esperar y mirarlo
7070058 se espera la participaci n de m s de 15 empresas paname as
7070059 la relaci n comercial no cuenta con el mismo poder que tienen las relaciones pol ticas
7070060 en nuestro pa s se instale un centro de redistribuci n el cual permitir a al cono sur no s lo estar m s cerca de panam sino de todos las naciones de la regi n
7070061 aunque es nuestro deseo no es como soplar el vidrio y hacer una botella
7070062 estoy muy orgullosa de haber sido capaz de ganar el oro
7070063 la carrera fue muy dura no estaba en el guion que yo ganara pero me hace muy feliz el haber roto los pron sticos

7070066 n o tem mais o que falar dessa sele o

7070070 el peor impuesto para las familias murcianas es la subida imparable de los precios hecho por el que el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero no est haciendo nada para evitarlo
7070071 que deje de ignorar la situaci n de las familias espa olas y comience a articular pol ticas que de verdad colaboren en llenar la cesta de la compra de las familias que al final es donde m s notamos el incremento de los precios
7070072 es vital que el gobierno de espa a ponga encima de la mesa un modelo de financiaci n econ mica justo para las diecisiete autonom as
7070073 la negativa del ejecutivo central a actualizar la variable de poblaci n en el actual modelo ha provocado la deuda de 1 400 millones de euros con la regi n dinero procedente de los 200 000 murcianos que son invisibles a ojos de zapatero
7070074 est en una posici n absolutamente sectaria con la regi n de murcia una posici n de abandono y de castigo
7070075 apoye a las empresas y que cree un sistema de financiaci n justo para todos los espa oles
7070076 en definitiva queremos que murcia tenga el mismo trato que cualquier otra comunidad
7070077 zapatero se empe en negar la crisis no hizo los deberes y esto ha sido perjudicial a la hora de tomar las medidas necesarias
7070078 como no se reconoc a la enfermedad no se le dio a la econom a espa ola las medicinas necesarias
7070079 hay la misma impotencia que en el 11 m pero menos rabia contenida los veteranos de la selecci n espa ola jugar n un partido ben fico en la uni n
7070080 its a part of life stuff like this happens we cant curse because we had a great olympics and were happy anyway
7070081 forget about exit strategies were looking at a sustained engagement that carries no deadlines
7070082 many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world
7070083 this is total war we are fighting a variety of enemies there are lots of them out there all this talk about first we are going to do afghanistan then we will do iraq this is entirely the wrong way to go about it if we just let our vision of the world go forth and we embrace it entirely and we dont try to piece together clever diplomacy but just wage a total war our children will sing great songs about us years from now
7070084 we have a choice either to change the way we live which is unacceptable or to change the way that they live and we chose the latter
7070085 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largess here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

7070091 en realidad en el bajo urubamba existen postas pero en los otros sectores afluentes no hay presencia del estado tenemos cinco colegios en diferentes sectores pero si hablamos de la cuenca del picha de mayapo de coshiri de tangoshiari no hay presencia del estado ellos dictan leyes en el palacio decretan leyes sin conocer sin haber palpado nuestra realidad el estado mismo el gobierno mismo se cierra nos quiere aplastar nos quieren dejar a un lado

7070096 wij hebben hier helemaal geen last van een terughoudende consument
7070097 als er negatieve berichten over de economie komen denk ik vaak daar heb je ze weer
7070098 maar zo slecht gaat het niet en hier al helemaal niet
7070099 of het nou minder gaat of niet de mensen blijven hier toch wel kopen
7070100 die liggen niet wakker van duurdere benzine ze kijken vaak niet eens naar de prijs als ze een tas van een paar duizend euro kopen
7070101 mensen kunnen heel zuinig zijn op kleine aankopen in bijvoorbeeld de supermarkt en voor andere categorie n betalen ze graag wat meer maar je kunt je geld maar n keer uitgeven ook als je meer dan een ton netto per jaar verdient daarnaast was een merk als gucci vroeger alleen voor de happy few maar nu kan iedereen er wel iets van kopen dat maakt de klantenbasis aanzienlijk breder waardoor ze ook kwetsbaarder zijn als het economisch wat minder gaat dat veel luxemerken in nederland nog nergens last van hebben verbaast me niet zo want hoe slecht gaat het nou eigenlijk

7070115 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7070116 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7070117 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7070118 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7070119 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7070120 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices

7070124 hey mike i wanted to let you know that since i read your truth about abs book my training methods and lifestyle have changed dramatically and i am finally getting results i should have gotten years ago it is refreshing to find someone who is actually trying to sell the truth and not scam us on some crappy contraption or supplement thank you very much for all the great info in your book and newsletters
7070125 hey mike i have been on your truth about six pack abs program for 7 weeks now and ive successfully dropped 20 pounds of body fat so far my workout and eating habits have improved greatly based on your advice in the book and email newsletters i feel like a new man thank you for everything
7070126 gimme a break mike ive tried it all before and seen it all before how can your abs program be any different or better than all of the other programs out there that promise me the world
7070127 hi mike ive been doing sit ups for years and have a vague 6 pack outline but cant get rid of that fatty bit at the bottom of my stomach to reveal the abs better ive recently bought your ab book and read it front to back can i just say that everything you talk about ive never had explained to me before and to be honest im blown away everything makes so much more sense now im now really pumped up to change my workouts from 2 hours a day and lots of cardio to your quicker and more effective methods many thanks for helping me straighten out my flawed workout habits and fitness
7070128 hey mike i have been on your program for about 4 solid weeks in that time i have dropped 15 pounds of fat already i cannot believe the results and it doesnt take up too much of my time i used to workout 5 days minimum for over an hour each time and i felt rundown and i wasnt seeing the results i wanted now with your workout program and advice on nutrition i feel energized and happier than ever whats great about your workouts is you never get bored you can mix things up and most importantly no more boring treadmill cardio sessions i workout 3 times a week now and for about 45 minutes each time mike you are a life saver and i would recommend your book to anyone
7070129 hey mike i just wanted to let you know i am enjoying great success with your abs fat loss program i have always been in decent shape and maintained a good physique but with the help of your program over the last couple months i have taken my fitness to new levels by intergrating your program into my routines and using your diet tips i have practically achieved my dream physique and i am spending less time than ever in the gym it is truly amazing who would have thought thanks again for everything
7070130 ive seen many books dvds amp websites claiming all sorts of miraculous things but mike seemed to really be telling it like it is and that is what i like i picked up a copy of his abs book and it has definitely stood apart from the rest in quality and enlightened me on things i had never thought of i am recovering from a shoulder operation so i emailed mike to see if he could help me not only did mike respond to my questions almost immediately he gave me further information which has benefited me greatly ive been working with mikes full body workouts for a couple months now and the workouts are great and my body is really starting to look ripped from stumbling across mikes website to buying his book to becoming one of mikes students i couldnt recommend mike or his products more highly
7070131 hi mike i have been adapting my lifestyle and workout routines based on your guidelines in your program and am making some pretty good progress over the last few weeks i started off at 185 lbs and am currently 180 lbs while feeling stronger at the same time i wear 33
7070132 when i first found mikes website and read the description of his
7070133 thanks mike for an excellent book most of the information you gave is actually new to me despite other books ive read ive been working out quite a bit lately but i realized from your book that i was not working out very effectively and was wasting a lot of my time with poor exercises i was also just reading over the nutrition section of your book and im very impressed with the detail given particularly since diet has been a confusing topic for me you really made it all seem a lot more simple and i learned a lot thanks for a great resource
7070134 mike i really have enjoyed your informative book im 56 years old and have lifted and worked out and tried different diets for the past 15 years or so with mixed results im trying to maintain my muscle weight and lose the extra fat i have ive been on your suggested lean muscle diet in your book for 3 weeks now and am starting to lose a decent amount of the fat around my waist so your program seems to be working well thanks for offering this book it has been a big help
7070135 when i met mike 2 years ago i was at a training conference and doing some networking with other trainers

7070140 in just the past decade we have moved from lone predators with limited reach to global communities of pedophiles on the internet
7070141 we have moved from back alley bookstores to criminal enterprises that treat children as merely another commodity for sale in the global marketplace we have moved from videos in plain brown packages to encrypted websites flash drives and cell phones capable of storing thousands of images
7070142 we are using new tools new technology and new partnerships
7070143 these teams have been deployed 33 times to assist state and local law enforcement with 15 children safely recovered

7070152 i found this notice a bit confusing so i phoned lewers which is only a few miles away and was told that since there is no funeral home in gibsonton the memorial service will be held here in ruskin still confused i inquired about a funeral and they were not aware any and suggested that the funeral service might be confined to family members only
7070153 china is more open i think its the best religious freedom improvement in the last few hundreds of years and i think the believer in china is practicing more religious freedom than before thats not to say were perfect we still have a lot of room to grow
7070154 they are on the run because of the olympic games the government did not like them in beijing or some of the cities where some of the events are being held and they were afraid they would meet with the media and say something they wouldnt like
7070155 engaging in the printing and distribution of a large number of illegal publications
7070156 unfortunately there has been a crackdown on house church leaders in wake of the start of the olympics
7070157 please join me in praying for all those in prison its a travesty that hundreds of christians sit in prisons while the chinese government pats itself on the back for its hosting of the games
7070158 most of them are more quiet particularly those in cities where olympic events are being held many of them were warned by the authorities not to do anything until after the olympic games
7070159 theyre more focused in prayer theyre more focused on one to one evangelism particularly the government church because religious freedom does not allow anyone to go out to the street you have religious freedom inside the church not outside the church
7070160 it is even cheaper in thailand but it was not possible for us to go there

7070162 i am here to promote national unity pkr and bn cannot solve the problems only akim can work towards solving the problems as we are not divisive
7070163 we need leaders who are interested to bring prosperity to the country i dont want the country to be in a situation where one side is bringing development to the country while the other is trying to bring the country down
7070164 other parties just talk about physical development we are also here to promote spiritual development as well as human capital development
7070165 if the cross over happens the country will be in turmoil but i personally believe that he will not make it
7070166 if i am forced to definitely i will accept it although i am not too keen to be the prime minister
7070167 but should i get elected to represent permatang pauh i will negotiate with other mps not for positions but to bring prosperity and unity to this country
7070168 even if akim is able to we are not interested to govern the country all by ourselves we need cooperation from other parties and most importantly the people

7070408 the globe is more likely to write a story about how some government program is going to assist the poor and downtrodden were more likely to suggest its a boondoggle that ought to be bounced off the face of the earth
7070409 tabloids in some cases say what other papers only think
7070410 a lot of people find tabloids to be beneath them in boston where the air is a bit more rarefied and youre closer to harvard some people have a problem with tabloids i think theres a certain nobility in tabloids
7070411 i dont think its that massachusetts has become snootier the old herald readers are just leaving the state the blue collar exodus has affected the paper
7070412 i dont think its time to give up the ghost
7070413 were facing the same challenges everyone else is trying to figure out what the future of the newspaper is going to look like
7070414 we have become more local we have significantly scaled back what we do outside the boston area were realists here we realize the business is changing
7070415 this truly is a daily conversation with our target audience
7070416 when you do the same search twice you dont get the same numbers
7070417 makes countries with low population density such as mongolia and canada appear to be getting short shrift
7070418 when you do the same search twice you dont get the same numbers
7070419 makes countries with low population density such as mongolia and canada appear to be getting short shrift
7070420 when youre not paying attention to a country you dont trade with it you dont send relief to it you dont have to intervene in it
7070421 it is not a tragedy if the printed newspaper dies what needs to be saved and will last is good journalism
7070422 amateurism misrepresentation and failing to emulate the standards of traditional news organisations
7070423 thats a victim thing you ask yourself am i just crazy did i make all this up somehow it might be easier to accept that youre crazy and made it all up than to admit that it happened and how awful it was
7070424 i have since subjected this problem to the most powerful chess computers and i am now convinced that duchamp has given us in effect a problem with no solution
7070425 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1 000 metres i have put together in years
7070426 im sorry i dont know what to say im pretty speechless right now
7070427 the realization of what he had been asked to do hit me like a punch to the gut
7070428 it was an honour for him he told me that although he didnt know the soldier he had delivered the news of his passing to the soldiers family and felt as if he knew them after many conversations in so few days
7070429 so heres a public thank you to our military men and women for what you do so we can live the way we do
7070430 someone has come up with a very powerful narrative thats very affecting thats plausible to support the cause
7070431 through our research this story has been circulating for years and is coming from an unknown source
7070432 there are enough real stories of heroism and honour and its not necessary to make up stories such as this
7070433 i think this story is addressing a perceived need by the military by military families and those who support the military and want to see something thats more positive about them in the public consciences
7070434 fiquei muito emocionado quando vi as imagens do tom exibidas no tel o n o tem como descrever apesar da dist ncia tenho uma amizade muito grande com caetano estou muito feliz
7070435 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7070436 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7070437 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7070438 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7070439 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7070440 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7070441 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7070442 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7070443 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7070444 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy he is always extremely well prepared is very smart a top level debater gutsy strong and has great personal integrity
7070445 det r f r mycket snack om medaljer vi har sex som g r till final och det r det b sta sedan 1984
7070446 the republicans plan would remove the blockade against nuclear power reduce regulations that slowdown development of new energy supplies provide tax exemptions for alternative energy production and promote ways to develop renewable energy supplies
7070447 energy problems arent below ground theyre above ground if state government would allow the marketplace to produce reliable energy at the most affordable price the cost of energy will go down
7070448 were leading with a real energy plan that will bring lower energy prices boost our struggling economy and strengthen minnesota family budgets
7070449 house republicans intend on making affordable energy one of our top legislative priorities in 2009 seniors on fixed incomes and families already stretched thin cant afford another session led by legislators who turned a blind eye to how energy costs are breaking family budgets

7070457 you cant take u s sen bob casey or other pennsylvanians biden is probably as good as it gets for pennsylvania
7070458 this is a move that i would rank up there with kennedy selecting johnson
7070459 i think hell be very valuable campaigning in places like wilkes barre and scranton where obama has shown weakness
7070460 he needed someone with foreign policy experience to play against mccains strength
7070461 whats interesting about the biden pick is that its a tacit admission by the obama camp that he lacks foreign policy experience
7070462 its the first time the obama campaign has admitted that obama is the least experienced candidate in the last 100 years of presidential elections
7070463 suppose rendell would have a heart attack god forbid then youd have the executive branch headless obviously the lieutenant governor would not be able to perform the duties of governor

7070517 while i was opposing the credit card industrys bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt mccain was supporting it and he even opposed helping families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical bills they couldnt pay
7070518 contrary to a lot of the rhetoric that has been tossed around this bill actually improves the situation of women and children who depend on child support he said at the time
7070519 it specifically targets the problems they face under the current bankruptcy system into a virtual extension of the current national family support collection system
7070520 a vote against this bill is a vote in favor of the current broken system he concluded
7070521 a vote for this bill is a vote to protect family support payments in bankruptcy

7070578 amid an existing textual economy a world and workplace powerfully self constructed according to the logic of contemporary media print publication broadcasting hollywood and the record labels but also punch cards printouts and paperwork experiences with digital networks have helped to construct a coincident yet contravening logic for digital texts partly in response to material features of the new medium and partly in response to the hugely varied contexts of their ongoing reception and development

7070622 two of the men jumped out and walked towards abdullas car
7070623 most of the shots hit the bonnet which caused the engine to break down
7070624 the robbers then ran to his car and one of them used his pistol to break the window
7070625 as he did so the pistol fell out of his hand and into abdullas lap

7070694 the realization of what he had been asked to do hit me like a punch to the gut
7070695 it was an honour for him he told me that although he didnt know the soldier he had delivered the news of his passing to the soldiers family and felt as if he knew them after many conversations in so few days
7070696 so heres a public thank you to our military men and women for what you do so we can live the way we do
7070697 someone has come up with a very powerful narrative thats very affecting thats plausible to support the cause
7070698 through our research this story has been circulating for years and is coming from an unknown source
7070699 there are enough real stories of heroism and honour and its not necessary to make up stories such as this
7070700 i think this story is addressing a perceived need by the military by military families and those who support the military and want to see something thats more positive about them in the public consciences
7070701 the police have filed a criminal case against him and we want the money to be recovered since we cant file the civil suit after february 2009 as it will become time barred then we want to do soon and recover rs 47 77 crore that he owes the bcci

7070711 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
7070712 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii

7070714 some state governments have offered land to the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur but i would like to assert that the project will be a reality

7070718 since the date for vote of confidence has been fixed for august 25 it has opened options for horse trading by the ruling party
7070719 were expecting a huge crowd more than 70 000 people the response to this years festival has surpassed previous years
7070720 the response to this edition from bangalore has been overwhelming as perhaps the citys residents now dont have a place to go and enjoy live rock music
7070721 if not pubs and discos performances in auditoriums and open air theatres especially the innumerable rock fests in the city will help us to carry forward our legacy
7070722 the ban needs to be immediately revoked it is in the pubs and discos that young musical talents have been showcasing their creativity over the last several decades
7070723 many bands from the city have made it big in the national arena and many young guns are waiting to make a mark in the indian music arena

7070729 take 2 have admitted that carnival games for the nintendo wii doesnt offer much choice in the way of skin colour but are promising to fix that for the sequel to the game stating that it was a complete oversight
7070730 unfortunately by the time it had gone to manufacturing it was something that couldnt be changed in the original product but when we were developing for the ds it was the first thing that we put in there because we knew we needed a larger variety
7070731 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7070732 ok so if you dont go do you think you can come and pick me up around 11
7070733 we have fully discussed the situation with the league and we need to be able to tell them on tuesday whether telford will be able to compete at epl level this season so they can make plans for the rest of the teams if necessary
7070734 the bottom line is that in order for tigers to start the season we desperately need to raise 20 000 by tuesday and we need to know that there is a core fanbase of more than 300 people this is the minimum number we need to see through the turnstiles every game to sustain us through the year
7070735 the coach and i have spent the summer putting together a team which we think will be competitive and exciting to watch but we will not be able to put that team on the ice unless we find funds to replace some of the sponsorship we had been expecting
7070736 the book took nine months to research write and lay out it wasnt the easiest of jobs because i didnt know a lot about farming when i started it really i did it for the town
7070737 being the towns reporter for some years helped me to learn about farming i took to tenbury wells because its a delightful little place and the people are so friendly i wrote the book to put something back because people had given me so much friendship
7070738 i loved writing changing scenes i loved working with some of the old farmers their stories and anecdotes were marvellous
7070739 when you look back at what they had to put up with for 150 years simply to make a living it is utterly remarkable
7070740 there was disease and illness plus two wars writing the book opened a door to a world that id never really understood

7070744 as a company we will continue to be the leader in entertaining the lifestyle gamer
7070745 re aligning resources ensures we achieve this goal for our most powerful brands
7070746 but we will take great care in the transition and continue to invest in the growth of the business specifically innovation for our magic and dungeons amp dragons fans
7070747 there are quite a number of outstanding issues and therefore i encouraged the director general to convene senior officials sooner rather than later
7070748 but it depends largely on the seriousness of purpose commitment flexibility of the key players and grandstanding isnt going to do it
7070749 we all recognize there is a need a legitimate need for a safeguard to address real surges and real emergencies
7070750 if misused or miswritten or abused it could end up having a devastating effect on global trade
7070751 give us a chance to test the seriousness of purpose of key players whether they are there to engage and solve problems or whether its just a superficial political exercise
7070752 we need to get to geneva as responsible wto members to at least attempt to stop the deterioration to reverse that and to build back toward a more ambitious outcome
7070753 our sense is we need to have a representative group of countries that are ready willing and able to engage in good faith to try to find an ambitious outcome to this round
7070754 and so ill leave it up to the director general to decide who those participants should be but that will have a bearing on the chances of success
7070755 asif ali zardari ha aceptado la votaci n un nime de los miembros del ppp y ser el candidato a la presidencia
7070756 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7070757 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7070758 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7070759 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7070760 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7070761 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7070762 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7070763 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7070764 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7070765 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7070766 en los a os 60 cuando estaban los hippies ramos felices
7070767 sen obama has shown what kind of administration hes going to have what kind of people hes going to have around him
7070768 and its clear that he wants people with strong opinions and not afraid to back them joe biden has demonstrated that throughout his life
7070769 it also shows that sen obama wont be pushed into a corner there were a lot of people putting a lot of heat on him to pick hillary clinton there were a lot of people pushing him in a couple different directions he followed a path that clearly demonstrates he wants the best person for the job
7070770 i think that weve become more homogenous as a nation
7070771 the idea that the vice president might be from my state doesnt excite a whole lot of people but i think what it does is create a perception of the candidate by whom they select
7070772 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else
7070773 apparently they think paid sick days are unworkable and economically harmful only if regular people are able to earn them
7070774 but with the advent of the fact checking obsessed blogosphere

7070783 as the pair of black necked storks stood around the pelican looked stressed and ready for a fight
7070784 another birdwatcher who was there thought that the pair of black necked storks was doing a mating dance to me it looked more like the pair was hustling the pelican
7070785 an interesting encounter seeing two heavy weight species interacting not sure if they were fighting for territory or were just messing around
7070786 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something
7070787 just being alive is such a lovely and wonderful thing
7070788 oh i see sorry for the misinterpretation i agree it mightve been misinterpreted i see it is admitting vulnerabilities for everyone
7070789 no the american newspaper isnt dead its just really re
7070790 things are really gorgeous and feel really good now what can happen from here
7070791 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7070792 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7070793 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7070794 the mission of the 752nd eod co is to help reduce the damage caused by explosive devices in southern baghdad to render safe and provide technical expertise to ground force commanders when it comes to anything related to explosives or improvised explosive devices
7070795 we are there to clean up their movement we are there to support and facilitate them in their fight against special groups or any type of ied manufacturer

7070800 they wont let me do anything thats unsafe and i try my best to run everything i do by them to give myself a second and third opinion of what i am going to do which there again increases my chances
7070801 cutting wires if i went off of color coded wires especially for something human built thats just not smart
7070802 team leaders are capable of giving an analysis of a post blast site
7070803 we may also offer ied and ordnance identification training to personnel who request it
7070804 people are being arrested and being held accountable for what theyre doing because of eods ability to determine what to dispose of and what to bring back for forensics

7070811 soren had openly proclaimed after the trust vote that he would be given the berth of union coal minister now for some reason he wants to be the chief minister of jharkhand
7070812 since the date for vote of confidence has been fixed for august 25 it has opened options for horse trading by the ruling party
7070813 obama needs to shore up his outsider status and domestic policy expertise with somebody who knows how washington works and has foreign policy expertise
7070814 oh theres no one around cuz its a weekday and everyone is at work right now
7070815 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation
7070816 a president has got to know the territory but thats not enough
7070817 joe biden thinks its time to remind the world of what america stands for freedom equality justice opportunity he thinks its time to put courage over compromise time to express americas outrage once again towards repression brutality violence the abuse of human dignity around the world and if the sparks fly so be it
7070818 the lord almighty or allah whoever if he came to every kitchen table in america and said look i have a faustian bargain for you you choose i will guarantee to you that i will end all terror threats against the united states within the year but in return for that there will be no help for education no help for social security no help for health care what do you do my answer is that seventy five per cent of the american people would buy that bargain
7070819 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7070820 you dont know my state my state was a slave state my state was a border state my state has the 8th largest black population its anything but a northeast liberal state
7070821 the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
7070822 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7070823 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that either the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
7070824 some have taken totally out of context my use of the word clean
7070825 look the idea is this guy is something brand new no one has seen before
7070826 in an industry that now has as much to do with profits as with prophets
7070827 is to take the scholarship and make it enjoyable to a readership that enjoys history
7070828 any biblical studies expert worth their salt would not have much interest in this at all except as kind of a curiosity
7070829 it was very common in antiquity to attribute ones own writings to the most important historians in the past
7070830 it happens not just in the bible socrates certainly didnt say everything plato quotes him as saying
7070831 part of the problem and to me one of the flaws is the assumption that this bible is working with that narrative is the primary genre of literature in the bible that just isnt true
7070832 its like you would attach a pack of cigarettes with a warning label from the surgeon general
7070833 well this bible should have a warning from the theologian general or something this bible may be harmful to your spiritual health
7070834 the bible can be intimidating for people and the chronology can help people put the timeline together in their minds
7070835 the fall is attributed to a drop in the prices of fuel and lighting and transport cost by 33 1 percent and 10 1 percent respectively
7070836 come on mo ive been waiting for the sun all day

7070838 girls hear that they shouldnt have kids and they interpret it as a rejection of their goal to be a parent
7070839 itll take me a lifetime old man to undo what youve done
7070840 we started with the most liquid market in the region and also the biggest equity market after saudi arabia
7070841 performance of the kuwait stock market has been strong up 600 per cent since 2000 and fundamental and economic indicators show strong potential for growth in the near and medium term for investors
7070842 we are currently evaluating options to list products in the region
7070843 investors are looking for low or non correlated assets to use in their portfolio construction and the mena countries have shown much lower correlations to markets such as the us or traditional developed and emerging markets
7070844 institutional investors will be the first to take them up then retail investors will probably follow
7070845 it is quite difficult to find an investable index for structured products as there is a lack of liquidity in some stock markets and many restrictions for foreign investors to access them
7070846 if we were to list etfs in the region we would need to be sure they could function in a transparent way in sufficiently liquid markets
7070847 this measure was taken after the companies registrars directorate consulted the state shura consultative council which concluded that iraqi banks that joined partnerships with arab and foreign banks are not allowed to own the properties of their headquarters and branches
7070848 this issue dragged those who invested in these banks in a big chaos that negatively affected their performance
7070849 it also contradicts the laws of the central bank banks and investment and is considered a hit to the private banking business in iraq and the economic hopes expected in this regard
7070850 the iraqi central bank is demanded to find fast and conclusive solutions for this big problem
7070851 the figures printed on the banknote do not reflect in any way its real value
7070852 in the 1950s agriculture was a main source of finance for the iraqi economy oil also played a role then with a modest contribution from industry now unfortunately industry depends mainly on oil economies
7070853 it will just reduce the money in circulation in iraqi markets
7070854 the problem is not with the zeros but with the relationship between the financial and monetary policy and the iraqi economic policy

7070859 one of the best uses of my saturday in as long as i can remember
7070860 en los a os 60 cuando estaban los hippies ramos felices
7070861 using gas or insert fires it works well in modern loft style conversions is well suited to bedrooms and has even been used in a conservatory the clean simple lines and bold modern design make it a striking focal point for any contemporary interior
7070862 grew tired of playing the game with you mere mortals
7070863 if im attracted to this hot guy at work im not meant to be with my man right
7070864 i like him so much but can i really live with his taste in music
7070865 when a guy lets a week pass before he contacts you its his way of forcing casualness in the relationship
7070866 its an unspoken signal that he doesnt want to pursue you seriously either because the timing is off or he just didnt click with you
7070867 i started noticing that bill would wear the same pants for three days and thought oh god i have to tell him how to dress im slowly going to start morphing into his mother
7070868 you start kicking the tires like you would a car because its a huge investment
7070869 you also have to realize that whether theyre looking for love going through a bad breakup or dating with no luck your friends reactions may be tied to whats happening in their lives not yours
7070870 men become overwhelmed and confused by the constant outflow of communication
7070871 we arent wired to relate that way and feel overloaded when were put in that position
7070872 look on his face when youre itching to talk girlie stuff
7070873 id love to imagine ripping off my girlfriends clothes during dinner but thats hard if im hearing a laundry list of her day
7070874 i found out my boyfriend had been married for six months a long time ago and it really threw me for a loop
7070875 the problem isnt his fall from grace its that youre making a huge deal out of something from his past that isnt really an issue anymore
7070876 i realized i fell in love with my guy because hes sweet hilarious and talented not because i assumed hed never been married
7070877 but its human nature to look and be curious and its ridiculous to think that just because you have a feeling youre so weak that youll act on it
7070878 defining your one and only soul mate keeps you from getting serious with guys
7070879 you automatically bypass men who dont fit into that exact mold
7070880 soul mates arent hatched they dont pop up out of nowhere
7070881 we went from hot to not in less than a year
7070882 i felt like we were already over because we didnt have sex as often or as eagerly as we did at the start
7070883 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7070884 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7070885 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7070886 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7070887 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7070888 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7070889 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7070890 who are open to doing something on the production side
7070891 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7070892 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7070893 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7070894 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7070895 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7070896 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7070897 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7070898 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7070899 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7070900 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7070901 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7070902 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7070903 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7070904 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7070905 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7070906 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7070907 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7070908 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7070909 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7070910 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7070911 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7070912 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7070913 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7070914 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7070915 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7070916 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7070917 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7070918 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7070919 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7070920 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7070921 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7070922 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7070923 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7070924 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7070926 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7070927 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7070928 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7070929 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7070930 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7070931 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7070932 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7070933 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7070934 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7070935 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7070936 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7070937 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7070938 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7070939 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7070940 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7070941 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7070942 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7070943 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7070944 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7070945 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7070946 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7070947 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7070948 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7070949 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
7070950 the idea that leaders of this party could meet for four days and have nothing but silence to greet them is unacceptable
7070951 we have a responsibility to speak out we have a right to be heard
7070952 theres a delicate balance between providing a safe and secure event and allowing people their first amendment rights
7070953 we are eager to show the russian automobile dealers conference some of the tools we are using in the states which are making our american dealers very successful
7070954 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7070955 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7070956 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7070957 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7070958 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7070959 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7070960 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7070961 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7070962 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7070963 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7070964 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7070965 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7070966 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7070967 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7070968 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7070969 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7070970 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7070971 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7070972 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7070981 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government about the eight americans currently being detained in beijing
7070982 we have asked for their immediate release and are continuing to follow their cases closely
7070983 this is the first time that the u s embassy in china is aware of that foreign nationals who were detained for protesting or planning to protest were held for this long
7070984 rather than attempting to block expanded drilling by preventing a vote they are now attempting to block it by bringing up a bill that is designed to fail
7070985 may plan to hold a vote on a bill that would make us more dependent on foreign oil and would likely make energy costs go up not down
7070986 there is bipartisan support in congress for all three of these measures
7070987 were going to enforce immigration law whether its convenient for people or not
7070988 obviously certain groups have shown they dont want our laws enforced as mandated by congress

7070996 i think this is a reflection of the progression of the culture as a whole

7071003 es verdad lo le recientemente vaya a ver si la pasamos alg n d a
7071004 no s qu pasa igual alg n d a doy el salto directamente al primero
7071005 iba a ser una carrera r pida porque por el clima hac a bastante bueno como para que la gente corriese bastante tambi n es verdad que llevo poquitas competiciones y quiz me faltaba un poco de ritmo de competici n
7071006 empec en barcelona el 19 julio y luego fue todo muy seguido con el campeonato de espa a y m naco donde logr la m nima para estar en los juegos y luego aqu directamente ha sido todo bastante justito
7071007 de todos modos aunque hubiera ido m s adelante las fuerzas ya iban muy justitas fue una carrera un poquito complicada y son todas muy fuertes

7071012 las declaraciones de ciertos representantes de la otan apuntan a que las maniobras navales en el mar negro fueron planificadas hace un a o lo que demuestra que el plan de ataque contra osetia del sur tambi n fue dise ado con antelaci n el a o pasado

7071033 si quieren reclamar a los animalitos los due os deben de traer papeler a que los acredite como propietarios del perrito debe demostrar que el perro no es problem tico pagar una multa y firmar una responsiva de que va a tener al animal dentro de su casa son muchos requisitos por eso mejor los dejan aqu

7071039 i think it certainly reinforces how important this race is in regard to the direction of the court the next president could very well be picking people for the court who will really set the direction of the court for the next 10 20 years so i think when you look at bidens background and you look at the fact that obama is the most liberal member of the senate according to the national journal it tells people i think that the nominees on the bench would be pretty liberal i think people will take that into consideration when they cast their vote
7071040 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7071041 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else

7071052 the republicans plan would remove the blockade against nuclear power reduce regulations that slowdown development of new energy supplies provide tax exemptions for alternative energy production and promote ways to develop renewable energy supplies
7071053 energy problems arent below ground theyre above ground if state government would allow the marketplace to produce reliable energy at the most affordable price the cost of energy will go down
7071054 were leading with a real energy plan that will bring lower energy prices boost our struggling economy and strengthen minnesota family budgets
7071055 house republicans intend on making affordable energy one of our top legislative priorities in 2009 seniors on fixed incomes and families already stretched thin cant afford another session led by legislators who turned a blind eye to how energy costs are breaking family budgets

7071067 you liberals are traitors dont ever speak out against our war plans we do not need more people we are doing just fine the war is going well
7071068 while constantly deepening economic reform and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue to pursue comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
7071069 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
7071070 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7071071 the leadership will be happy with the olympics and not just the gold medals but the performance of the people im optimistic that the values and tolerance learned during the olympics and the earthquake in sichuan will continue
7071072 the fact we are first in the gold medal table makes the world pay attention to china every chinese is very happy and proud the olympics forces china to be on the international stage
7071073 the olympics has been a great opportunity for china to learn some international things for example that audiences should not cheer tennis players as theyre about to serve
7071074 people who won bronze or silver or even no medals such as liu xiang or some athletes who could not compete because of their injuries or other reasons are all heroes
7071075 be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking for if the people of israel did not escape when they refused to listen to moses the earthly messenger we will certainly not escape if we reject the one who speaks to us from heaven when god spoke from mount sinai his voice shook the earth but now he makes another promise once again i will shake not only the earth but the heavens also this means that all of creation will be shaken and removed so that only unshakable things will remain since we are receiving a kingdom that is unshakable let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe
7071076 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7071077 we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7071078 zardari has accepted the pakistan peoples partys unanimous drafting of him and he will be the candidate of the pakistan peoples party
7071079 it should be someone who is a national figure has national stature and is non partisan
7071080 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
7071081 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
7071082 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
7071083 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
7071084 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
7071085 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
7071086 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
7071087 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
7071088 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
7071089 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples
7071090 you have reached level 20 to pass to the next quest you must now kill the prince of zombies

7071092 every time the government has lost data ministers have promised a crackdown but nothing has happened and a culture of complacency remains
7071093 civil penalties wont do the regrettable conclusion is that only the threat of a criminal sanction will change mindsets and jolt this government to ensure proper precautions in future
7071094 what we are very clear about is that all the security protocols as i understand it were maintained by the home office in terms of the encryption of data and passing the data on in encrypted form that has been downloaded not in encrypted form and thats where the breach appears to have happened
7071095 they wanted to go out of the olympic games with a bang and make a statement i think overall our team had been a little down until we had a meeting with them and told them they had eight medals more than any team since 1992 once we told them that you could see the light bulbs go off we felt very good about going out there and hearing the national anthem on that podium
7071096 they worked so hard sanya was disappointed with her open 400 and for her to bear down and do what she did today was amazing it was an incredible race all our young ladies did an excellent job it just shows the heard and soul they have i was proud of them they ran with so much heart they wanted to show american were doing fine and we have more medals than we have had in a while
7071097 in srebrenica at the time we had to protect ourselves from the bosnian muslims rather than protect the muslims from the serbs
7071098 they told me they came here in apprehension and worried because they expected to be hated in serbia just like back home they said in srebrenica at the time they had to protect themselves from the muslims rather than protect muslims from the serbs serb army according to them was helping the muslim women and their children bringing them food and water
7071099 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
7071100 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
7071101 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
7071102 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
7071103 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
7071104 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
7071105 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
7071106 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
7071107 i can only assure you this is a result of the efforts between reno and charter communications we have been in discussions around the clock over the last couple days to resolve this and get to a point where we can start working together
7071108 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7071109 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7071110 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7071111 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7071112 the fact is its a wonderful feeling i won the u 20 world cup last year and now this and to win it with friends like leo too i just cant put it into words
7071113 its very special to win this title especially with diego being here he congratulated me and said id had a great tournament you cant ask for any more than that
7071114 people said a lot of things that annoyed me before i came to china everyone knows that thats what makes this medal so special i think argentina won the gold because we had a fantastic team that really pulled together you could see that on the pitch
7071115 im absolutely delighted because this was the last opportunity i had to play in the olympic games
7071116 the final wasnt very exciting perhaps but you have to go out and win these games its as simple as that ill be wearing the medal on the plane home i wont be taking it off for anyone
7071117 yes to the whole team which has been together for over a month even though i was a long way from my family i never lost sight of our objective and winning the gold is amazing
7071118 my daughter wasnt born when i won a gold medal at athens so im going to enjoy this one with her no matter what happens in my football career from now on no one can ever take away the pride i feel at achieving something like this especially in a sport as difficult as football we won because we played attacking football and we never stopped trying things and we beat brazil in the semi finals it was the perfect tournament
7071119 too many adults looked at mrs phelps boy and saw what he couldnt do in beijing the world saw what he could do
7071120 obama might feel constrained by such irrelevancies as consistency and arithmetic
7071121 we are so happy that god protected us we are rejoicing here with the lord but pray for our bodies we were beaten quite badly please pray that we would receive healing
7071122 after interrogating them we have come to know that the training camps were conducted in kerala and this conspiracy was planned there in which safdar nagori and his associates were involved on the basis of which we are bringing him and his associates we will bring nagori by sunday and four of his associates namely karimuddin nagori ameel pervez shibly and mohammad hafiz are being produced today
7071123 that is why i felt it was right for me to submit the resignation to the governor
7071124 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7071125 well sure its easy to play that game in a huge gym with 100 ft

7071267 ik zat net op de wc te denken aan een verhaal over mij met een paar willekeurige bekenden in een corrupt land met een ak 47 concentratie ver boven het mac maximaal aanvaardbare concentratie ja ik heb biologie gehad en n het was niet leuk we spreken er echter wel nederlands we zitten in de trein cynisch over ons bestaan te praten plotseling komt er een groepje gewapend uitschot onze kant op ze vragen mijn naam en een fantastisch visioen fluistert dringend dat het een scherp plan is om mijn echte naam voor degene die hem al weten te houden pjotr lindenroth zeg ik met een accent dat moet lijken op dat van een rus die zijn eigen taal allang vergeten is spreek je pjotr niet op een andere manier uit zegt n van de dominanten in deze situatie naar de grond glimlachend bedenk ik mezelf dat deze figuren van zichzelf denken een partij hersens hebben die de gemiddelde dictator overvalt in grootte misschien maar misschien vertel ik mijn naam aan jullie op de meest nederlandse manier om het simpel te houden me bedenkende dat mijn wereld me zo plat mogelijk pjotr noemt en ik daar al een tijdje op reageerd het accepterend als mijn naam vind je het nu echt nodig om je levensverhaal tegen me te zeggen vraagt onze eerder genoemde dominante niet volledig uit zijn woorden komend nee ik leg je wat uit luisterde je niet is mijn veel te arrogante antwoord ik maak hier uit wie er luisterd eike hoe weten wij zeker of jij de waarheid over je naam wel spreekt kapt een potentieel mooi doch gewapend meisje hem af ze probeert aandoenlijk mijn arrogante gelaatsuitdrukking over te nemen mijn accent behoudend jij had best een opleiding kunnen doen weet je dat je snapt dat ik eigenlijk best sjoerd wierda zou kunnen heten maar nu hoe heet ik nu jullie zullen het pas weten als jullie me in elkaar slaan hetzelfde meisje maakt haar kalashnikov klaar om er met n simpele beweging een afdruk mee in mijn wang te planten als ik haar snel doch rustig vertel maar daarmee zouden jullie de mentale kracht die jullie ontbeert uitlichten irritant hoog nederlands of het goed is maakt erg weinig uit ze kennen hun eigen taal nauwelijks gebruiken is mijn beste wapen nu ik ze in de situatie van een mentale knokpartij heb gewrongen

7071327 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7071328 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7071329 well follow multi party competition periodic elections human rights and press freedom
7071330 the new government will follow the public private partnership model for economic development and promote industrial peace create jobs and ensure smooth supply of consumer goods
7071331 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7071332 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7071333 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7071334 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7071335 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
7071336 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
7071337 the seriousness of such failures could be beyond the stretch of peoples imagination

7071342 they cannot use peace negotiations as a shield for their criminal acts
7071343 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7071344 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7071345 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7071346 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7071347 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7071348 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7071349 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7071350 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7071351 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7071352 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7071353 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7071354 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7071355 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7071356 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7071357 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7071358 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7071359 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7071360 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7071361 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it
7071362 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians
7071363 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
7071364 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion

7071370 the day i broke up with my boyfriend evan was the day he wrote the song you know the song im sure youve heard it maybe you danced to it at prom or sang it in your car on a friday night when you were driving and feeling like you must be inhuman to be this happy the windows down and nothing but air around you your mom has probably hummed it while cleaning the dryers lint trap and your grandpa has most likely whistled a couple bars if hes the whistling type according to the poll on the front page of usa today sixty three percent of americans blame me for the breakup so let me clear the air right now theyre right sixty three percent of americans are no fools when it comes to knowing about my love life which is really creepy and isnt helping me sleep well but its true i broke up with evan and eight hours later he had a song in his head and a guitar in his hand and it snowballed from there

7071420 i am delighted that frans agreed to be the interim dean
7071421 i think for a transition he will really make sure things grow strongly he spans applied physics material sciences and other disciplines he has a broad view of the world
7071422 i feel that ive taken this engineering and applied sciences to a high level in the last 10 years and it has to be taken to the next level
7071423 thats a minimum five to 10 year project i thought it would be better if a new person comes in
7071424 hes been a wonderful director in that he can advise and suggest without dictating and still bring out the best in researchers
7071425 you sort of dont know hes directing but the end result is really good
7071426 its probably impossible to find a better person for this position
7071427 my feeling is that he is just a perfect candidate for the interim dean and in fact maybe for the dean of seas
7071428 the catholic church clearly teaches that abortion is a grave offense against the will of god throughout my years as archbishop of new york i have repeated this teaching in sermons articles addresses and interviews without hesitation or compromise of any kind thus it was that i had an understanding with mr rudolph giuliani when i became archbishop of new york and he was serving as mayor of new york that he was not to receive the eucharist because of his well known support of abortion i deeply regret that mr giuliani received the eucharist during the papal visit here in new york and i will be seeking a meeting with him to insist that he abide by our understanding
7071429 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
7071430 we have heard a great deal this year about the need for change
7071431 but at the same time we are told that one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe vs wade
7071432 it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe vs wade
7071433 abortion is different abortion is the killing of the innocent on a massive scale
7071434 it is time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
7071435 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
7071436 it is time to stop creating excuses for pro abortion candidates catholics should no longer be asked to be partners in the abortion regime by voting for politicians who support abortion
7071437 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
7071438 it is time that catholics shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians of every political party who defend the abortion regime of roe vs wade
7071439 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7071440 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7071441 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7071442 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7071443 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7071444 i say you dont vote for the person you vote for what the stand for
7071445 we keep constantly asking the kids how good do you want to be how far do you want to take it this year was last year good enough all the kids say no they want to take this thing farther
7071446 its a small town its a close town these guys a lot of their fathers brothers and even grandfathers have played on this team theres a lot of tradition here
7071447 the parents are great when you go around town everybody knows you at something but if you do good in football theyre going to recognize you take care of you
7071448 were 5 miles apart got friends we talk to these guys every day during the summer but once the football season starts just dont talk to them anymore not until after the 29ths over
7071449 im not concerned with wins and losses those things will take care of themselves what im trying to establish here is work ethic commitment and being proud to be a red devil i dont see we have that as much it may not pay off this year but 2 3 years down the road its going to pay dividends
7071450 its been great he knows what hes talking about different offense defense you got to pay attention a lot because its a lot of new stuff
7071451 i cant wait to go out there on a friday night and be under the lights the fans should expect a good game theyre tough were tough and itll be a good game come down to the last quarter

7071455 i wanted to follow my dream and pursue my passion for dance
7071456 the hardest part was going into the audition process with a knee injury knowing i wouldnt be performing to my very best ability
7071457 thoughts and prayers from family and friends definitely helped get me through it
7071458 i have always been strong in my faith but going through a process like this taught me even more to totally rely on god for everything and every need
7071459 my family was here with me for the weekends off auditions but after making it to training camp i didnt even have time to drive back to mississippi
7071460 i stayed in dallas with my one suitcase and was fortunate to have a family to stay with whom i consider my texas family
7071461 this process was definitely the most challenging experience ive ever been through but also the most rewarding
7071462 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
7071463 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
7071464 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
7071465 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7071466 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7071467 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7071468 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7071469 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
7071470 but i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference
7071471 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards

7071483 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7071484 the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
7071485 as a governor i know the value of having reliable partners who are willing to tackle tough challenges in washington the failed economic policies of the last 8 years have left states across the country struggling with budget shortfalls even here in virginia we are facing tough economic times an obama biden administration will give me and governors across the country the kind of partnership we need to deliver results for americas working families
7071486 while families across america are looking for results and solutions oriented leaders senator john mccain offers more of the same failed policies of the last eight years the obama biden ticket offers americans a clear choice and a real opportunity for change
7071487 after reviewing the match footage the competition supervisory board decided to reverse the match result due to an error in judgement grb great britain advances to the semifinal

7071492 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7071493 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7071494 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7071495 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7071496 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7071497 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7071498 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7071499 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7071500 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7071501 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7071502 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7071503 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7071504 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7071505 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7071506 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7071507 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump

7071519 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7071520 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees

7071541 this is without doubt the greatest mobile experimentation in politics weve ever seen
7071542 texting and cellular phones are still sort of a new frontier in politics even though they are widely used by people
7071543 its our belief that mobile will be as vital in politics in the next few years as tv and internet are today
7071544 im sure they know to the minute how many people are signing up
7071545 this notion that there is sort of a mystery and the mystery is going to be revealed is capturing some of that magic to get people involved in a very personal way
7071546 these are die hard republicans so you can imagine how many independents and fence sitters are now signed up and waiting for barack obama
7071547 his opt in e mail list is 10 million large which is tremendous
7071548 and now hes probably got a million cell phones which is incredible
7071549 people have given him a relatively personal and very direct means of getting in touch with them its not a piece of information that exists in other databases
7071550 you have to keep in mind that the most powerful social network people hold is that 20 or 30 people in our phone we call the most often tapping into that social network would be an incredible accomplishment even if it was just a half a million or a million people
7071551 a million people can then go out and reach another 20 or 30 million people
7071552 when youre in the minority you have to communicate smarter and more effectively i think republicans will indeed catch up

7071581 as humans we constantly incorporate other peoples current actions as clues cues as to what they may do in the future
7071582 for instance we have a sixth sense on the highway to know that a certain car will swerve into our lane soon based on the drivers current driving patterns then we may become more defensive in our own driving in our work we wanted to begin the process of allowing robots to use behavioral cues of humans or other robots to make the robots mission more reliable and accurate in social work environments populated by numerous people and robots these types of cues should be abundant
7071583 we should be teaching pelvic floor exercises to girls in adolescence

7071616 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region

7071646 it is fitting to have our memorial program at fire station 88 because they were one of the first urban search amp rescue teams to arrive at ground zero following the attacks im deeply honored to join them to remember all lost that day and since
7071647 i want all the families to know that their loved ones were treated just like they were my son
7071648 victims of 9 11 became grouped in as a number or faceless name but the most compelling way to remember these lives these souls is to
7071649 the members of congress cannot understand what these men and women are experiencing not only are those who served at ground zero suffering sick and dying but families are devastated putting childrens futures at risk these heroes must have an america which takes care of instead of forgets its heroes the james zadroga 9 11 health amp compensation bill must be passed when congress returns from recess so that this national disgrace can finally come to an end
7071650 we are going to put the honest truth about ground zeroes suffering heroes in their faces and hope that decency will prevail and they finally pass this legislation before another september 11th passes all of us are wondering about cancers and other diseases that are showing up five six seven years later what will our families face in the future
7071651 no podemos adelantar cantidades cu ndo y c mo es un proceso que tenemos que trabajar individualmente porque cada familia tiene necesidades espec ficas pero tenemos plenamente las capacidades y los recursos para hacer frente a esas compensaciones y es un compromiso que hemos tomado con las familias
7071652 estamos plenamente asegurados con firmas de reconocido nombre a nivel internacional
7071653 la informaci n que nosotros estamos en capacidad de proporcionar es la que la compa a maneja sobre algunos aspectos de nuestra operaci n de nuestra compa a y su personal desafortunadamente las familias est n pasando por un dolor que es totalmente indestructible y tienen necesidad y tambi n el derecho de saber lo que ha pasando exactamente con ese vuelo en cada segundo de esa operaci n
7071654 la frustraci n que se ha generado la entendemos y compartimos adem s porque hemos perdido nueve compa eros en este vuelo pero hay cosas que competen exclusivamente a la comisi n investigadora el poder determinar es una comisi n que acaba de iniciar su trabajo as que lo tenemos que respetar y darles el tiempo para que comiencen a describir lo que ha pasado
7071655 al proceso de investigaci n hay que dejarle trabajar con todas las garant as para no entrar en especulaciones que luego puedan generar m s confusi n y m s dolor
7071656 tenemos que entender que en un proceso tan complejo como es un accidente a reo las cosas no ocurren tan deprisa como uno quisiera es un proceso que tiene que tomar tiempo cada accidente es nico y cada accidente se compone de cuestiones que no se repiten en otros accidentes no hay actualizaciones cada d a no hay informaci n que se va generando cada a minuto
7071657 todo lo contrario ahora hay que tomar mucho tiempo paciencia y recursos
7071658 para ayudar a las v ctimas y supervivientes a superar este trance de la manera m s c moda posible

7071690 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7071691 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7071692 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7071693 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7071694 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7071695 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7071696 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7071697 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7071698 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy
7071699 thats the question id ask them if that is answered correctly that that is the case then it answers the question which means they would support roe v wade
7071700 as a freshman democrat he was approached by all sides
7071701 he told them that while he personally opposes abortion he would not vote to overthrow the us supreme courts 1973 roe v wade decision that gave women the right to terminate a pregnancy
7071702 i dont think i have the right to impose my view on something i accept as a matter of faith on the rest of society
7071703 in my view the mexico city policy is anti democratic because it attempts to silence foreign recipients of u s funds
7071704 it is the policy of the united states to advance the cause of democracy by promoting the values which we hold dear such as freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom of the press
7071705 the mexico city policy flies in the face of these fundamental values by attempting to restrict the speech of recipients of u s funds
7071706 this is a gag rule pure and simple it restricts speech and for the life of me i cannot understand why anyone republican or democrat would support a provision that would violate the first amendment if applied to u s based organizations
7071707 of course foreign citizens and organizations do not have constitutional rights
7071708 but just because we can legally apply this restriction does not mean that it is good policy and i do not believe that it is
7071709 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7071710 likewise none of us should accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7071711 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
7071712 while they are to be treated civilly respectfully and with gospel charity they should never be put forward as a model of a catholic in public life

7071717 to end it with an olympic record after everything theyd gone through that shows you that they care about representing america
7071718 we gave it our all and we ran an olympic record and close to the world record
7071719 a lot of things happened here that we werent expecting that gives us a lot to work on for the world championships next year
7071720 i knew i had to pull out a supreme effort to help our team win and im happy we were able to do that i came to the olympics to win a gold medal
7071721 we wanted to come out with the new uniform a new fresh attitude and fresh outlook and go out there and prove our point that its not over yet
7071722 weve been overshadowed by the wonderful performance of the jamaicans but honestly weve had a very strong performance this year
7071723 it was a fantastic day for me i was so happy to achieve this performance its not easy to achieve double gold in the olympics
7071724 we discussed the race beforehand but we did not do what we said we would
7071725 we talked about maybe after five laps going faster but we started earlier from the beginning after one lap we changed the plan during the race and im sorry the other ethiopians dont have a medal
7071726 this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7071727 there were many good competitors in todays race but especially bekele
7071728 there is a big gap between us but we think we will train harder and we can narrow the gap one day
7071729 they confiscated all of the bibles 315 in total and were told that only one per person was allowed

7071740 that the complaint of the plaintiff s phillip ofume is hereby dismissed against the defendant s department of social services and the defendant s recovers its costs of action

7071746 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
7071747 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works
7071748 hey ed do you know what it means to have such a gad damn stupid person tell you he is a doctor
7071749 let us go and worship the stupidity of these bush nazis

7071755 on the other hand dumb boy could just bomb beijing and claim all the gold medals he would be the ultimate olympian he would even win the medals for team sports for they would have to forfeit the games these bush nazis can do anything that they put their sh t eaten brains to
7071756 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come
7071757 this guy killed himself i found a gun in his hand and i took it
7071758 oh that that was dreamed up by someone munching turds on the toilet
7071759 i wrote in 98 that david wolf was the one to take over and get davids house of jacob built
7071760 hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes that do not see who have ears that do not hear
7071761 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
7071762 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
7071763 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house

7071770 i dont have issues with advertising but with your ability to turn it off
7071771 i think we can all agree that public advertising is a manipulative powerful medium that isnt in the best interest of the general public it takes up my mental space and its assaulting

7071775 basically my frugal belief i do not consider myself a cheapskate is that i paid 110 for our family cocker spaniel from a rescue organization six years ago and i will pay no more than 110 to keep her alive
7071776 there are many who think burning 18 grand to keep a dog around for six or 12 extra months is madness
7071777 sometimes i think so too but my wife died from lymphoma two years ago and i have no children what am i going to do buy a bigger television set

7071790 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7071791 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7071792 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7071793 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7071794 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7071795 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7071796 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7071797 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7071798 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7071799 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7071800 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7071801 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7071802 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7071803 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7071804 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7071805 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7071806 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7071807 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7071808 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7071809 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7071810 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7071811 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7071812 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7071813 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome

7071826 el momento m s importante de mi vida desde que soy jugador de f tbol
7071827 un estiramiento brusco despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n
7071828 algo que en un primer momento le dej abatido pero ahora se ha dado cuenta de que puede ayudar al equipo desde el banquillo con otros detalles
7071829 hay que darle tiempo al tiempo todav a no s lo que har pero al europeo de polonia igual voy como comentarista de televisi n
7071830 fragt man erstens einen kandidaten der soeben sauber das f r und wider sagen wir der wehrpflicht dargelegt hat nach seiner meinung dazu dann ger t er ins schwimmen man k nne das so entscheiden oder auch so und wie w rden sie entscheiden mmh das ist schwierig zu viele dieser nachwuchsakademiker haben zwar ahnung aber keine meinung
7071831 zweitens wirken viele von ihnen berdressiert in puncto sozialkompetenz keiner redet dazwischen noch der gr te schwachsinn wird mit interessierter miene hingenommen aus angst einen fehler zu machen h lt man sich lieber zur ck frei nach dem motto tu mir nichts ich tu dir auch nichts
7071832 die kriterien ehrgeiz beziehungsweise gute netzwerke erhielten jeweils eine gesamtnote von 1 58 als erfolgsfaktor nummer drei folgt ber ein klares werteger st zu verf gen 1 79
7071833 am hinteren ende der skala befinden sich die kriterien soziale herkunft 2 33 stabile ehe partnerschaft 2 35 sowie herausragende intelligenz 2 5
7071834 ein guter europ ischer manager folgt eher langfristigeren zielen ist unternehmerischer weniger finanzorientiert er ist st rker in seinem sozialen umfeld verankert und diskutiert ver nderungen im unternehmen intensiver mit den angestellten der umgang mit anderen kulturen f llt ihm oft leichter
7071835 aber auch deutsche unternehmenslenker m ssen ihren stil berdenken je unsicherer die zeiten sind desto mehr wird f hren eine pers nliche angelegenheit menschen brauchen ein gewisses ma an sicherheit um erfolgreich zu arbeiten und diese sicherheit l sst sich nur durch pers nliche werte wie verl sslichkeit integrit t und wenn man sich um die menschen sorgt vermitteln
7071836 according to miki tsusaka a senior partner and global leader for the marketing and sales practice of the boston consulting group
7071837 continuous changes in the global marketplace require that companies have a strong and ongoing developmental focus on improving their go to market capabilities to succeed companies need all marketing and sales functions working together holistically moreover these functions must be closely aligned with an enterprises corporate growth plan and strike the right balance of getting internal and external i e consumer customer competitor inputs
7071838 to the extent that they are striving to enhance their go to market skills many companies seem to be focusing largely on small and near term problems instead of tackling larger strategic operational and organizational issues
7071839 this shortsightedness can have broad and negative ramifications for enhanced efficiencies revenue generation and profitability
7071840 it is relation based persuasion a strategic process for getting peoples attention pitching your ideas and obtaining approval for your plans and projects it is in short one of the most important skills in the repertoire of any entrepreneur employee or professional manager whose work requires them to rely on influence and persuasion rather than coercion and force
7071841 classical geniuses from aristotle to cicero considered idea selling they called it rhetoric to be one of the most critical subjects an educated person could learn yet two thousand years later most schools have stopped teaching it

7071865 ein emotional intelligenter manager nutzt emotionale daten und die weisheit der gef hle
7071866 an dieser stelle m chten wir noch einmal die wichtigste botschaft dieses buches betonen emotionen liefern daten die ihnen helfen rationale entscheidungen zu treffen und angemessen zu reagieren wer diese datenquelle ignoriert vernachl ssigt einen wichtigen aspekt der verf gbaren informationen die arbeit einer f hrungskraft oder eines managers die entwicklung effektiver teams effektive planung und entscheidungsfindung mitarbeitermotivation die kommunikation einer vision change management und die schaffung effektiver zwischenmenschlicher beziehungen erfordert den r ckgriff auf emotionen als quelle der inspiration und des feedbacks das emotionale system ist ein intelligentes system deshalb hat es sich in der evolution durchgesetzt nicht zuletzt beim menschen unsere emotionen weisen uns den weg sie motivieren uns dazu das notwendige zu tun
7071867 1 emotionen sind informationen 2 es ist nicht m glich emotionen zu unterdr cken 3 emotionen zu verbergen funktioniert lange nicht so gut wie wir annehmen 4 nur entscheidungen die emotionen ber cksichtigen sind effektiv 5 emotionen folgen einem logischen muster 6 emotionen k nnen universell sein aber auch sehr spezifisch

7071870 the organizational and strategic challenges facing players who serve as game leaders are familiar ones recruiting assessing motivating rewarding and retaining talented and culturally diverse team members identifying and capitalizing on the organizations competitive advantage analyzing multiple streams of constantly changing and often incomplete data in order to make quick decisions that have wide ranging and sometimes long lasting effects but these management challenges are heightened in online games because an organization must be built and sustained with a volunteer workforce in a fluid and digitally mediated environment
7071871 tomorrows business landscape could well be alien territory for todays business leaders at many companies important decision making will be distributed throughout the organization to enable people to respond rapidly to change a lot of work will be done by global teams partly composed of people from outside the institution over whom a leader has no formal authority that are assembled for a single project and then disbanded collaboration within these geographically diverse groups will by necessity occur mainly through digital rather than face to face interaction

7071914 powerwalk is een sport die is overgewaaid uit amerika het wordt ook wel fitwalk genoemd of in het nederlands fitlopen of sportief wandelen powerwalk houdt het midden tussen gewoon wandelen en een hardlooptraining bij powerwalk wandel je in een stevig tempo zon 6 tot 7 kilometer per uur waarbij je een krachtige armbeweging maakt en extra actief afzet met je voeten daardoor gaat je hartslag net zover omhoog dat het genoeg is om je conditie te laten verbeteren de training begint met een goede warming up en eindigt met een cooling down zo voorkom je dat je spierpijn of blessures krijgt ook doe je tussendoor rek en strekoefeningen om het effect te vergroten bij powerwalk ben je actiever dan bij gewoon wandelen je doet dus echt aan sport een groot voordeel vergeleken met sporten zoals hardlopen is dat je bij powerwalk veel minder je gewrichten belast bij hardlopen kom je elke keer met een schok neer wat relatief zwaar is voor je onder meer je knie n omdat je bij powerwalk geen schoksgewijze belasting hebt heb je veel minder kans op blessures

7072053 peter burgoyne was someone people have been doubting for a fair time i thought he showed what he can do hes playing on ball against some pretty good players and he ripped them apart
7072054 he started on the bench he showed his willingness to run hard to tackle to win clearances hard ball gets kicked goals displayed all the want that he wants to be here next year
7072055 i think thats what our supporters our football staff and even our players were looking forward to him displaying
7072056 it was really poor really poor not competitive enough for long enough that would be in our top three or four really poor efforts for the whole year
7072057 they probably shouldve kicked more goals if their accuracy was better im sure the game wouldve blown out a lot further than it did
7072058 it hasnt sunk in yet theres probably been too much focus on the importance of the game this week
7072059 the two points is far more important than it being jason and myselfs last game at win stadium
7072060 i think when i have a little quiet moment to myself there will be thoughts i think good memories rather than sadness
7072061 were one of the better defensive sides in the comp and where we have struggled a little bit has been our attack
7072062 ben rogers is a points player and last week he showed he can definitely add something to our team
7072063 we still have to work in that area were maybe defending a bit too much maybe coughing up too much ball
7072064 were having to really be desperate on defence when we can ease the pressure a bit by holding on to the ball and getting down their end
7072065 i wasnt 100 per cent sure about how my ribs were going to go and to get through the 80 minutes and play solid i was very happy
7072066 i thought the second half was a lot more composed and when we got ourselves in the game properly we got it nutted out
7072067 i thought we were a little bit flat from a short turnaround from monday night obviously the tigers before us were probably a bit off the pace too
7072068 we had a lot of defence and a lot of turnovers probably added to a lacklustre first half but halftime probably saved us it gave us a breather and we started again
7072069 we have not got the money we have to adapt or address it or perish itv wants to go on it sees a business in making the kind of programmes we have been making for the last 50 years there is a proper business there
7072070 all we can do is very strong work but we have to be able to have discretion to move around more than we were in the past
7072071 over the last 25 years itv has been the whipping boy we have a lot of clutter which we need to push out we have to fight our corner instead of taking it and being the whipping boy as we have been for so long
7072072 my plea is that we dont spend another five years debating this
7072073 we want a psb system we want plurality and we need to find a solution to set itv free and underpin channel 4
7072074 if we squabble amongst ourselves we will all end up with government let off the hook
7072075 lets get this sorted out and join together as an industry and argue or this issue is in danger of being ignored
7072076 width of the nose and the length of the face
7072077 in the standing sessions we have to stand still and smile for half an hour or more we also run about a 1 000 metres every day for physical conditioning
7072078 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games
7072079 the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the wtf and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7072080 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7072081 theyre a good defensive team theres no doubt about it but i dont think they play defensive football
7072082 theyll come up here maybe in mind to play counter attack but i just think theyre a solid defensive unit
7072083 to win games youve got to get forward you try and score goals so hopefully if they do try and come up here and win itll open things up for us
7072084 pace is always important but you dont have to be lightning quick in terms of playing at the back
7072085 some people say players lack pace but ill use tony popovic as an example
7072086 tonys never been quick but hes quick upstairs in terms of his thought process and his intelligence
7072087 i just like that in our side we do have a lot of pace and pace can sometimes get you out of trouble and then win you games
7072088 things are going well at the moment and weve done a lot of work with the bike making one or two changes and weve more to come
7072089 i enjoyed a winning double at oulton park last month and want the same again here to try and close down the championship and want to be in second place leaving here im only eight points down on that and am feeling confident ahead of these races
7072090 i know that i gave them a lot of work to do after knockhill so i want to repay them with some results to really celebrate about
7072091 we didnt think we played well we had a lot of senior players down but in the last quarter our boys found a way to win which was the most important thing
7072092 i know they got close to us at the end but we came from seven points down at three quarter time and got ourselves three goals ahead that was a pretty fair turnaround
7072093 gehen sie mal davon aus sie werden zum thema kanzlerkandidatur noch vor weihnachten etwas erfahren
7072094 die spd ist leider kein verl sslicher partner mehr sie ist zu sehr mit sich selbst besch ftigt
7072095 ich glaube keinem in der spd der mir sagt es gibt nach der bundestagswahl keine zusammenarbeit mit der linkspartei
7072096 waarom gaan ze nou niet weg dan blijven ze vast ook hier boven slapen neeee
7072097 for a candidate running on a change message its very hypocritical for barack obama to pick the consummate washington insider to serve as his running mate
7072098 obamas decision to name joe biden as his running mate proves once again how out of touch he is with hardworking pennsylvanians
7072099 probably the last quarter is a reflection of the year the inconsistency i suppose and losing another one when youre in front
7072100 tonight we were a fair way in front at three quarter time so its heartbreaking and the double blow that youre out of september
7072101 after tonight after 21 weeks we tend to know that our season will end next week so thats always a very hollow feeling when you get to that point
7072102 and when you are five goals in front at three quarter time and that happens i guess the feeling is a little bit more hollow
7072103 i think weve had a lot of games where weve come from behind
7072104 if we could get some score on the board we were maybe a chance to hit back quickly and we did that and with that we grew confidence and belief and we got a sniff
7072105 hes a high quality player hes great at keeping possession hes got great vision and hes training really well
7072106 we learned a lot about them and they no doubt learned a lot about us
7072107 youd think wed come ready to play but obviously at the moment the effort is just not there
7072108 eight goals to two in the first quarter is disappointing because its a big game youre playing for high stakes
7072109 but at the moment the guys are just incapable of coming with the required intensity to compete at afl level the way that its played now
7072110 theres guys there who have given everything over the last five and a half years but at the moment other teams are lifting and the group as we know it thats been so good is just not capable of producing the performances that they once were
7072111 youd have to say its over based on tonight and based on our last couple of months
7072112 the first half of the season was really good we had young blokes play really well and had some middle guys really improving but theres some guys who have really tailed off and you cant blame the younger guys
7072113 its unlikely were going to do much damage over the next few weeks
7072114 by and large i could never complain about the endeavour or the pressure put on the sydney players
7072115 theres no doubt were finishing the season very poorly this is three years in a row this has happened in the last month and were finishing about the same 10 or 11 wins we cant get past that
7072116 were going to have to move some players on simple as that
7072117 i said at the start of the season this is a watershed year for the club we cant finish this year waiting for potential to happen and waiting for players even our own juniors who we thought might go another level who havent its time to bite the bullet and go look for some players to improve the club
7072118 weve had three years to improve on 05 and to win a comp and not make the semis i think changes have to be made
7072119 i dont know what sort of changes but we cant keep going on doing the same things coming up with the same results
7072120 it was probably the response that we needed it was all about righting the ship a little bit
7072121 were just still a little loose in our defence that we need to correct
7072122 we played a lot of good football and i dont think anybody can take that away from us
7072123 to be honest we could have been three up at halftime comfortably and we could have even gone on with it in the second
7072124 but central coast to their credit the longer you take to finish them off the more chances they have to come back into a game and they did it again to us
7072125 this time it was a little bit of magic from shannon cole which won the game
7072126 the new rules are always going to take a bit of time for people to accommodate for stuey and im not defending him but he probably isnt aware with how serious the ffa and the referees are about verbal challenges to their decisions because he hasnt been here but he knows now well and truly how its going to be in the future
7072127 its still a free kick whether theres 10 players on the field or 11 it doesnt make a difference
7072128 he doesnt get it the mere fact that you would have someone compare the circumstances now in the past or in the future of iraq to the ending of world war ii and the ending of the korean war absolutely demonstrates a total fundamental lack of understanding of what the problems america faces
7072129 angry hateful spiteful and uncapable at all of being civil or caring about life
7072130 for obama whose only obvious weakness in the race is his light foreign policy resume
7072131 to neutralize the connecticut senators well earned reputation as a skilled attacker
7072132 ultimately biden fell well short a finish that had more to do with his inability unwillingness to raise the money necessary to compete with the big three of obama clinton and former senator john edwards n c than his own campaign skills
7072133 everyone wants a limo but you can only supply so many
7072134 and the notoriously loquacious biden and his campaign team has been preternaturally quiet over the past few weeks a silence that is fueling rumors that he is the pick
7072135 there is no case for biden while he is on the money with the issues and the realities of the issues he has no problem towing the party line and partisonship wich makes him arrogant and a loser
7072136 obama has reopened the rcp gap to 4 6 with only rasmussen showing less than a 3 lead and seeing as how rasmussen has been about as accurate as a magic 8 ball during this election cycle im not so sure that its worth using
7072137 stealing lines from the then labor party leader when baroness thatcher was p m in britain for the record he cited kinnock every time except the once it was caught on video if anyone wants a fair bio of biden i post the link to wikipedia below
7072138 not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
7072139 um last time i checked the vice president has some major tasks too like say governing
7072140 there arent all that many tasks for the vice president advocate for the presidential nominee stump in off the beaten track places and most importantly attack the other partys candidate
7072141 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7072142 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7072143 you know there will be three days in the campaign where someone in chicago will get a call and respond what did you say he said
7072144 i think i have a much higher iq than you do
7072145 found that a third of those polled in minnesota say theyre less likely to vote for mccain if gov pawlenty is on the ticket picking minnesotas republican governor tim pawlenty as his running mate might cost mccain more votes in the state than he will gain thirty four percent 34 of minnesota voters say they are less likely to vote for the gop candidate if pawlenty is the vice presidential nominee while 28 say it makes them more likely to vote for mccain thirty five percent 35 say it will have no impact on how they vote nearly a third of unaffiliated voters 32 however say putting pawlenty on the gop ticket makes them less likely to vote for it while 22 say it makes them more likely to vote for mccain only 11 say mccain is very likely to pick pawlenty
7072146 21 years ago in a speech i hadnt properly prepared for because i had been busy preparing for judge borks supreme court confirmation hearings i accidentally forgot to attribute a story to neil kinnock i had given the speech a dozen times prior where i properly attributed kinnock
7072147 the problem for obama is the charge of inexperience does he have sufficient gravitas to handle the weight of the office he is running for
7072148 that reality means that in every story about biden done in the aftermath of his selection kinnocks name and the allegations of plagiarism would come up
7072149 look at how much experience i have after 30 years in the senate
7072150 the file also included mr bidens transcript from his days as an undergraduate at the university of delaware in his first three semesters his grades were cs or ds with three exceptions two as in physical education courses a b in a course on great english writers and an f in r o t c the grades improved somewhat later but were never exceptional
7072151 hes an old white man hes not strongly associated with any ethnic or religious subgroup basically he doesnt bring any demographic or geographic area over to obamas side and his campaign last year was unimpressive
7072152 joe biden has been a senator for 36 years this country is his lifes work but he has never wanted to the corrupting influence of washington so for this reason he went home every night to delaware never living in the capital city that is probably why he has one of the lowest net worths in the senate
7072153 a detailed examination of bidens public statements that turned up several more examples of potential plagiarism and resume inflation the feeding frenzy eventually chased the delaware senator from the race
7072154 why cant we attack edwards is it only republicans who are taken down for extra marrital affairs
7072155 while any political junkie worth his or her name knows all about the kinnock incident its a mistake to assume the average voter knows about it
7072156 getting rich has never been regarded as being in any way sinful degrading or morally dubious within the jewish religion so long as such wealth is acquired legally and used responsibly

7072159 i think the doctors pretty much know how to estimate the damage there off the bat when its as bad as it apparently is
7072160 i guess everything there is subject to the scanning and all that but it certainly isnt good
7072161 it would depend on how bad it is but if it requires surgery its a six month injury
7072162 not many people get to go out on their own terms in this sport and that would be very sad for him if he missed a big farewell
7072163 im sure the club would still give him a magnificent farewell but its not the way he would like to have gone out hed like to go out with his boots on im sure
7072164 next week is such a big occasion for the newcastle club with all the ex players coming back into town

7072171 im pretty down im on some painkillers i wanted to finish the season with the boys but i wont be able to do that now
7072172 i just copped a whack and all of a sudden my jaw locked up and i couldnt move
7072173 i saw the doctor at halftime and he didnt want me to go back on but i didnt give him a choice
7072174 i was out there before he could stop me i was hoping i wouldnt get another knock around the head in the second half and i didnt so im thankful it wasnt worse

7072186 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7072187 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7072188 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7072189 this change in the convention program will allow thousands of first time participants a chance to take part i cant think of a better convention finale for our nominee who has made reaching out to voters a hallmark of his campaign

7072194 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7072195 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing

7072205 ils sont partis ce matin et on ne sait pas o ils se trouvent
7072206 these men who died of the spanish flu at our camp in de souge france beside whose graves we stand have made just as complete sacrifice of their lives to the cause for which their country stands in this world war and hence to their country as any who have fallen or shall fall in the front line of battle
7072207 they faced conditions to them as deadly as charging through bursting shells or the patter of machine gun or rifle bullets
7072208 the miasma of the dread disease they breathed proved for them as deadly as the poisonous german gas waves or from gas shells and their restless suffering from fever tortured bodies and congested lungs was as pitiful as any death from bayonet thrusts or shrapnel rents
7072209 the heroism in the soldier consists in the fact he offers his life to his country with full intent to meet whatever fate may befall him
7072210 he does his part when in response to his countrys call for service he says here am i send me or when with equal cheerfulness he responds to the law of his country providing for that countrys service in her defense or in her necessary aggression to maintain her rights and establish justice
7072211 here he has some control of his actions and especially of the spirit in which he answers the call to duty
7072212 those who died of disease in our stricken camp were among those who cheerfully and voluntarily placed their all upon their countrys altar in sacrifice and that sacrifice in full measure was taken by powers they could not control and in the sum of things in this world war upheaval their sacrifice and their heroism will count for just as much as the sacrifice and heroism of those who may fall in immediate action against the enemy
7072213 to you our comrades who sleep in this peaceful vale of france among her pine clad hills we say farewell
7072214 farewell a word that must be and hath been a sound which makes us linger yet farewell
7072215 have you ever watched love actually and wished that more people had died in it
7072216 this isnt about the self tanner its about lying to us
7072217 the morning air breathes a new and laughing energy into the veins and marrow every dawn is a new contract with existence
7072218 wreaking havoc in our household among our children in our workplace in our community even in our church
7072219 this week let us be aware of the workings of the evil one
7072220 it is like having somebody from south jersey running for vice president
7072221 perspective also seems to recognize that latin america has come of age and validates in principle the reform experiments in the region that the bush administration has vilified
7072222 governments that cared more about their own power than their peoples progress and prosperity
7072223 its time to press haitis leaders to bridge the divides between them
7072224 if the obama campaign continues to build a grassroots base we have the raw material for making change
7072225 you know i shouldnt have this cookie later because my friend bob just died and i shouldnt be having good thoughts like how good the cookie is i think ill give it to ron i bet he wouldnt mind since he didnt know bob as well as i did and it wont be as disrespectful if he eats it and enjoys it later

7072231 baseball in the united states is a huge business and unless they find a way to have a couple weeks break i dont see them letting their best players leave
7072232 you might take two or three players from a club and they may not win the pennant they may lose the pennant because of it id love to see big league players in the olympics but i dont see that happening in the near future
7072233 its up to manager joe girardi and pitching coach dave eiland how they want to do it they know what theyre doing and the doctors obviously know
7072234 i would not try to stop a gibbon it would just be too crazy thats nuts why would someone stop a monkey

7072252 we live in sacramento and are looking for something that we can just run through town in and not have to pay 5 a gallon to pay gas on

7072254 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
7072255 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
7072256 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
7072257 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
7072258 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
7072259 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
7072260 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
7072261 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
7072262 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
7072263 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
7072264 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
7072265 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
7072266 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again

7072457 es ist das erste rennen mit dem getriebe und wir haben damit eindeutig einen fortschritt gemacht
7072458 was wir hier gesehen haben ist dass einige teams auf einer neuen strecke in die richtige richtung gearbeitet haben und andere nicht das team hat einen guten job gemacht und mir ein auto gegeben das heute eines der besten war
7072459 so completely out of line with what i have experienced and expect from apple
7072460 es ist klar dass ich nach diesem qualifying entt uscht bin denn ich hatte ganz andere vorstellungen
7072461 jetzt steht uns ein schwierigeres rennen bevor aber auf einem stra enkurs kann alles passieren
7072462 wir m ssen weiter hart arbeiten und uns eine strategie berlegen mit der wir morgen auf alle eventualit ten vorbereitet sind
7072463 es war nichts schlimmes aber auf dieser strecke ist ein kleiner fehler sehr teuer ich denke ich kann immer noch um den sieg mitk mpfen vor allem wenn ich einen guten start schaffe wir haben ein gutes auto das im rennen stark sein sollte
7072464 das ist aber nichts neues die qualifyings waren dieses jahr nicht leicht f r mich ich bin also nicht berrascht dass es nicht so gelaufen ist wir haben die situation verbessert aber es ist noch nicht so wie wir das wollen wir werden versuchen es n chstes mal besser zu machen

7072469 ich war mit der balance meines auto zufrieden und ich wurde im verlauf des qualifyings immer schneller
7072470 ich machte keine fehler und fuhr absolut am limit deshalb bin ich ber den f nften platz etwas entt uscht
7072471 auf der saubereren seite der strecke will ich gut starten und so viele punkte wie m glich sammeln mit unserer strategie sollte ich im rennen ein paar pl tze gutmachen k nnen

7072641 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7072642 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7072643 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7072644 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7072645 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral
7072646 global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
7072647 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7072648 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice
7072649 our expectation is that growth will slip back to a considerably below trend rate and there is even the possibility of a mild contraction in the second half of the year
7072650 i have reached a conclusion that we should not even have these hearings that we should just go right to the floor like they used to do in the old days
7072651 theres nothing international about this until we get nato in there and we get islamic forces in there
7072652 control freaks who are allowing their ideology to get in the way of common sense
7072653 our goal should be to take the american face off the occupation so that we are not blamed for everything that doesnt go right in iraq
7072654 weve tried the military surge option before and it failed if we try it again it will fail again
7072655 it is not in the national interest of the united states to deepen its military involvement in iraq

7072660 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope
7072661 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7072662 the possibility of the defeated militia or any other troops challenging the islamic militia who are now in control of kismayo is not simple or realistic
7072663 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7072664 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7072665 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7072666 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7072667 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7072668 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7072669 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7072670 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for that we have competition for places
7072671 hes been a very well respected officer in our department and in the community
7072672 el pr ximo 23 de septiembre dos meses exactos antes
7072673 el 23 de noviembre no solo est n en juego las alcald as y las gobernaciones sino que est en juego el proceso revolucionario y la juventud tiene que estar en la vanguardia asegurando la continuidad del proceso revolucionario
7072674 toda vez que la competencia disciplinaria de la comisi n de funcionamiento y reestructuraci n del sistema judicial se origina en una norma que emana de la asamblea constituyente y por tanto de rango superior al legal establecida en 1999 es decir con anterioridad a la causa iniciada contra los ex jueces ya que se le otorg competencia de forma general para conocer de todos los procesos disciplinarios contra los jueces de venezuela bajo un procedimiento com n y no existe una norma a nivel interno que expresamente haya asignado la competencia para conocer del caso en cuesti n a un rgano distinto a la comisi n por todo ello la corte decidi que no se configur una violaci n del derecho a ser juzgado por un tribunal competente consagrado en el art culo 8
7072675 en definitiva se trata de dos procesos diferenciados por ello la corte estima que no se viol la cl usula general de no discriminaci n contenida en el art culo 1 1 de la convenci n americana en relaci n con el derecho sustantivo a ser o do dentro de un plazo razonable consagrado en el art culo 8 1 de dicho tratado
7072676 como resultado de la implementaci n de un nuevo modelo de desarrollo educativo mucho m s inclusivo
7072677 este a o 76 12 provendr n de los liceos p blicos mientras que 23 5 ser n de instituciones privadas lo cual se corresponde con la distribuci n de la educaci n media y diversificada de las instituciones del pa s
7072678 la campa a se va a sostener exclusivamente con el dinero recaudado por la venta de los bonos y la donaci n de los partidarios
7072679 es importante decirle a todos aquellos que sean inscritos en el psuv que acudan y donen su d a de salario para el partido que es en pro de la revoluci n
7072680 cuidado con todos aquellos que manipulan de d nde vienen los fondos los fondos vienen de la militancia venta de bonos y eventos especiales y ya tenemos los libros contables que se lo vamos a entregar al cne
7072681 hay candidatos que son gobernadores alcaldes si est n cumpliendo funci n del estado pueden tomar los servicios p blicos en funci n de su cargo no de candidato
7072682 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7072683 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7072684 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7072685 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7072686 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7072687 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7072688 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7072689 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7072690 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7072691 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7072692 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7072693 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7072694 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7072695 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7072696 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7072697 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7072752 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7072753 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7072754 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7072758 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

7072762 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7072765 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7072766 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7072767 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7072768 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7072769 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7072772 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7072773 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7072774 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7072775 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

7072777 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

7072781 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7072783 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7072784 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7072785 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7072786 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

7072788 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7072789 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7072792 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7072793 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7072794 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7072795 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7072796 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7072797 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7072798 they dont have many hockey players but still they are the no 2 in the olympics

7072801 dutch players are excellent but our players are not inferior since they did their best
7072802 it is amazing that we can finally get the gold medal you can see almost the whole stadium is orange china were really tough but in the last 25 minutes we managed to score
7072803 hockey is important and popular in argentina i hope the medal will encourage more boys and girls to play hockey
7072804 we had many strong teams as our opponents this is our first olympic games and we lack lots of things
7072805 some players are too young to follow the pace and they need more experience
7072806 a great country like spain with lots of good players did not score but we did it

7072817 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7072818 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7072819 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7072847 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7072848 its very likely that the obama campaign looked at the polls and said even with evan bayh and the millions weve already spent we cant win indiana obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change

7072857 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
7072858 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
7072859 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
7072860 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
7072861 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible

7072882 we all ran our hardest and ended up getting an olympic record a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting we use that to build on this was a great way to finish the olympics it could have been a world record with a close race but we all ran comfortable out there
7072883 we have the best 400 runners in the world in the u s

7072911 once they had him on the ground and the cuffs on him there was no reason to beat that man they way they did no reason whatsoever
7072912 the safety and security of our passengers is our highest priority
7072913 not a priority our highest priority this is not a metro issue or a city issue or a county issue it is a communitywide issue
7072914 and then they want to see if they can do it faster than somebody else theres always a level of competition you cant beat
7072915 personally i kind of like it when theres a lot going on
7072916 its always a good thing when we have close to 100 000 people in downtown st louis
7072917 all our major venues are in use and thats an exciting thing to be able to say
7072918 so its nice to save money on the ac whenever i can
7072919 and this has been the nicest month of the summer
7072920 so im expecting to get an even lower bill next month
7072921 weve got a couple of fans that we run at night and thats all we need
7072922 but this year the inside has been empty during happy hour and there have been one hour waits for a seat on the patio
7072923 laptops video game systems bigger houses many with two refrigerators security systems elaborate lighting in gardens cell phones plasma tvs that use as much power in three hours as a full size refrigerator uses in a whole day all these have contributed to demand for electricity that has risen 30 percent in missouri alone since 1990
7072924 so they know whats on the table what the consequences are
7072925 economic development for missouri depends on either retaining or importing great talent
7072926 the secret is to help these young entrepreneurs decide to stay in missouri from the beginning and that means that we have to have affordable high quality education right here at home
7072927 i dont know what i want to be when i grow up
7072928 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7072929 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7072930 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7072931 now i know you come pretty highly recommended on this paper but you want to be trail boss of this whole drive and you have no experience why didnt you say that up front
7072932 well you didnt ask besides i feel very confident i can do it between me and my chicago posse here
7072933 always has been ever since the day i was born
7072934 oh ok well what kind of experience do you have with herds
7072935 hurting no no injuries whatsoever of any kind i am not hurt at all
7072936 ha ha i misspoke uh because my gang or my posse told me the uh wrong thing what i meant to say is and what ive consistently said is ive herded doggies
7072937 you know if they tried to steal some of the cattle how would you handle it
7072938 well i wrecking id have to sit down and have a talk with them
7072939 id say maybe they shouldnt be stealing cattle thats what id say
7072940 do you mean youd set some conditions say how the sheriff is backing you up threaten to get a warrant set guards or
7072941 oh yeah all of that stuff ive always said that and id attack the pakistan ranch
7072942 i heard some of your cowmen say some cow stealers are there
7072943 listen i have one last question please describe to me your philosophy of keeping track of the different breeds on the drive and how would you approach branding
7072944 listen buddy i dont want anything to do with breeding and cows im sure they know how to do that themselves thats way above my pay grade as trail boss but you should hire me because ive heard of all the great ways to move doughgees together without hurting any of them and i hope you know i change my clothes often so i will not be stinky to my fellow cowhands and i know how to work well with all of them and to bring all the different kinds of cows together branding is prejudice and i would treat all the cows equally thank you
7072945 i came by bull by the way wouldnt you want to know who my assistant trail boss would be
7072946 hey mac i know i said you might be too old to lead this drive this time i bought what some of the libby cowboys were telling me about this guy and i admit now i was wrong at least you know what youre doing and you got plenty energy enough
7072947 and you you got no paperwork showing what in tarnation you did in chicago and i dont care get out of here
7072948 humph you dont know what youre missing youre all so bitter around here with all your guns i didnt want to stay here anyway the price of arugula is too high if youre not smart enough to know who i am destined to be its your loss humph
7072949 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the
7072950 barack obamas choice of joe biden as his running mate is unlikely to shake up the presidential horse race
7072951 the choice would make them voters less likely to vote democratic on election day
7072952 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7072953 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7072954 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7072955 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy obama who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7072956 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7072957 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7072958 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7072959 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7072960 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7072961 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7072962 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7072963 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the

7072965 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7072966 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7072967 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7072968 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7072969 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7072970 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7072971 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7072972 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7072973 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7072974 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7072975 imagine our circumstance in the world were there no israel how many battleships would there be how many troops would be stationed
7072976 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq
7072977 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7072978 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7072979 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7072980 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7072981 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7072982 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7072983 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7072984 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7072985 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7072986 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7072987 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7072988 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7072989 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7072990 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7072991 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7072992 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7072993 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7072994 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7072995 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7072996 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7072997 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7072998 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7072999 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7073000 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7073001 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7073002 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7073003 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7073004 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7073005 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7073006 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7073007 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7073008 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7073009 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7073010 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7073011 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7073012 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7073013 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7073014 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7073015 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7073016 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7073017 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7073018 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7073019 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7073020 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7073021 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7073022 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7073023 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7073024 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7073025 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7073026 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7073027 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7073028 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7073029 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7073030 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7073031 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7073032 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7073033 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7073034 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7073035 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7073036 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7073037 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7073038 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7073039 god has given and god has taken away blessed be the name of the lord
7073040 i had the awesome privilege to look in to linux certification this past week you know like how when novell says suse runs well tech broiler episode 61 the smelly laptop
7073041 and who aaaaaare these mac and linux people anyway they have to be so different from everyone else whats with this whole editors note foss is more valuable than 60 billion
7073042 a vulnerability was reported in openssh on red hat enterprise linux
7073043 uk law firm exaggerates its 30 000 win over pinball game sharer
7073044 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7073045 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7073046 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7073047 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7073048 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7073049 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7073050 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7073051 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7073052 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7073053 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7073054 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7073055 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7073056 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7073057 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7073058 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7073059 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7073060 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7073061 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7073062 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7073063 senator if youre in there just tell us how many homes how many bedrooms and baths i know youre pressed for time but if you can
7073064 the whole house thing is a slippery slope do people really care about this stuff

7073071 ich will bei delikten wo die missbrauchten kinder schwere k rperverletzungen erleiden einen h heren strafrahmen jetzt liegt dieser beim sexuellen missbrauch von unm ndigen bei ein bis zehn jahren da kann ich mir f nf bis 15 jahre vorstellen auch dort wo der kindesmissbrauch den tod des opfers zur folge hat verlange ich von der justizministerin eine strafrahmen erh hung auf bis zu 20 jahre
7073072 die opfer von kindersch ndern finden einfach zu wenig beachtung man muss klar sagen dass die strafen zu gering sind und die richter das strafausma oft nicht voll ausn tzen
7073073 durch strafanhebungen w rde die politik ein klares signal setzen dass bei sexualstraft tern toleranz fehl am platz ist derzeit ist die judikatur bei sexualdelikten nicht so streng wie etwa bei verm gensdelikten oder einbruchsdiebst hlen
7073074 sexualdelikte passieren nicht nur im beruflichen umfeld und im vereinsleben sondern auch im famili ren und nachbarschaftlichen bereich auch hier muss es daher t tigkeitsverbote geben es kann und darf keinen unterschied machen ob jemand im rahmen seiner beruflichen t tigkeit ein sexualdelikt aus bt oder in seiner freizeit sexualstraft ter haben in der n he von kindern nichts zu suchen

7073081 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7073082 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7073083 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7073084 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7073085 the white house isnt a place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power
7073086 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7073087 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who

7073090 se os democratas acham que podemos indicar um candidato com condi es de ganhar as elei es para presidente sem que ningu m esteja blindado no que se refere seguran a nacional e pol tica estrangeira acho que est o cometendo um erro tr gico
7073091 acho que ele pode estar pronto para ser presidente mas n o acho que ele v ser presidente agora a presid ncia n o algo que se aprende de uma hora para outra
7073092 john mccain o candidato republicano um amigo pessoal um grande amigo e ficarei honrado de me apresentar contra ele ou com ele para a presid ncia o pa s s teria a ganhar com isso estas duas declara es foram exploradas novamente numa propaganda publicit ria do partido republicano por ocasi o da indica o para vice
7073093 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7073094 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7073095 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7073096 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7073097 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favor of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers
7073098 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7073099 i would be happy to make you the head of the civil rights division of my administration
7073100 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7073101 i think he can be ready but right now i dont think he is
7073102 i would be honored to run with john mccain i think the country would be better off
7073103 i know ricky will be as good a papi as he is a dancer
7073104 ricky is a very giving person and will make a wonderful parent he has wanted his own children for quite a while

7073106 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome
7073107 she took one bite of prasadam and said she had never tasted anything so good before

7073111 i t is no use to save any of these buildings you might as well leave your hose alone because you cant do any good
7073112 you must become sensitive to the essence of the subject matter then you decide which themes are expressed through the situation or event and select the details that best express the theme you choose to illustrate
7073113 photo editing is the entire process of selecting photos from the photographers take cropping them determining or at least influencing their use on the printed page photo editing begins when you press the shutter you should be thinking about the needs of the story and the photos you can make that will tell the story best
7073114 it is not unusual for a photographer to become subjectively involved with the photos and think an image says more than it really does
7073115 a judgement is a what that demands a why judgements like interpretations depend on reasons judgements without reasons are not particularly beneficial to declare something good or bad original or remarkable without giving reasons as to why it is thought to be so is merely to offer a conclusion and however well founded or thought out that conclusion might be it is not very revealing or helpful if the reasons behind it are not offered in its support
7073116 like interpretations judgements are neither definitively nor absolutely right or wrong rather judgements like interpretations are more or less convincing persuasive and compelling depending on how well or poorly they are argued
7073117 an appreciation of natural design and a knowledge of the principles of visual design will play a major part in your selection of subject matter and the success and impact of the final image

7073121 aps john fournier strikes again writes hit piece on obamas vp pick
7073122 canada continues to be a major producer for both domestic and international markets exporting significant quantities primarily to the u s and to a lesser extent japan australia and new zealand
7073123 if karl rove had written mr fourniers article about barack obamas choice of joe biden as the vp pick it could not have been any more biased why not just come out and say that obama should just quit the race and send john mccain a box of donuts with sprinkles while hes at it the ap used to be a great independent news service but now it is just an echo chamber for bush cheney and the republican talking points is mr fournier hoping for a job as mccains press secretary if he is elected or is he just doing whatever his bff karl rove tells him to do
7073124 wait til you see what we have for your birthday just wait no i cant tell you just wait

7073126 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
7073127 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
7073128 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
7073129 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
7073130 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature

7073140 la pr sidence de la r publique revient notre parti et cest pourquoi les parlementaires de notre mouvement ont demand zardari d tre leur candidat
7073141 el equipo est motivado para un partido que puede dar un t tulo

7073149 in joe biden barack obama gets a uniquely qualified candidate for change as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee senator biden is one of americas foremost experts on the global challenges facing our nation having overcome the very worst of lifes adversities senator biden understands the pain that families are feeling and knows the way forward through tough times
7073150 obama biden will be a powerful force for change and an important partner in growing our democratic majority in congress with barack obama joe biden and a deep roster of democratic house candidates committed to forging a new direction america has a clear choice this november between continuing the bush mccain status quo or the democratic agenda for change
7073151 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election

7073154 barack ha escogido al senador joe biden como nuestro candidato a vicepresidente
7073155 no ha habido hasta ahora peor cr tico de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que el propio joe biden
7073156 biden ha denunciado el escaso juicio pol tico de obama en pol tica exterior y ha criticado personalmente lo que los estadounidenses est n empezando a constatar que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7073157 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across t
7073158 somos optimistas acerca de que el ep logo de este caso ser positivo

7073160 more than 55 3 billion cigarettes are produced every year in the country
7073161 english should be taught in japanese elementary schools because young children are more likely to learn languages easily than adults
7073162 learning a foreign language will not have a nagative effect on childrens first language skills language acquisition theories tell us that learning a foreign language can also enhance their learning of the first language
7073163 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased

7073166 we all agree that this station needs to service the township for another 15 years down the road that location is not going anywhere for some time so we need some improvements
7073167 we felt that as long as we continue to maintain it that buildings probably good for another 25 years without maintaining it it probably wont last that long
7073168 weve been talking about this for three or four months already
7073169 zardari est de acuerdo con ser el candidato a la presidencia
7073170 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
7073171 we have never been in a situation so severe never ever before
7073172 the current situation is unprecedented as nearly the whole country is in crisis
7073173 we do not for the sake of security have journalists reporting from somalia so you dont see the pictures you dont see the reality
7073174 you dont have the impact with the politicians with public opinion and therefore it is a forgotten crisis
7073175 our immediate goal is to launch the official beachcare web site www beachcare org to inform educate protect and celebrate the worlds beaches
7073176 i love the beach and am thrilled to work in the nonprofit and environmental fields
7073177 this effort will unite psds and western with a very influential group of global movers and shakers in the name of environmental education and responsible coastal management
7073178 the time for the department of homeland security dhs to scrap their current approach to airline security is well overdue now that the terrorist screening centers terrorist watch lists have passed one million entries
7073179 the american people would be comforted if our presidential candidates denounced these burdensome practices senators mccain and obama should declare a moratorium on the use of the lists unless drastic measures are taken to improve their accuracy and protect innocent americans hoping to travel without burden
7073180 watch list systems are worse than worthless they create security risks by diverting scarce homeland security resources away from actual terrorists by focusing attention on hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent travelers those innocent victims wrongly caught in the dragnet of suspicion are left without recourse to clear their good name upon completion of the investigation that uncovered all these deficiencies congress should publish all findings and recommend that dhs approach airline security in a manner that is both effective for our nations security and respects the freedom and liberty of innocent travelers
7073181 we know that the atlantic basin hurricane season peaks from august to october but long term prediction of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes is still a developing science
7073182 these events all point out the urgent need to better understand earths natural processes and how to live with them
7073183 iype recognizes that earth can be a dangerous place as our growing world population tends to settle along the coastal and mountainous areas of the continents our communities become more vulnerable to the risks of multiple hazards
7073184 we have made important strides in hazard science and reducing risk using scientific knowledge coupled with monitoring and warning systems there is however much still to learn
7073185 it is critical to partner with communities engineers government officials and emergency preparedness personnel to successfully prepare for disasters and build resilient communities
7073186 if we cant convince a nation like australia of the importance of protecting sharks from this destructive fishery we will have little hope of convincing poorer nations to refrain from slaughtering the worlds sharks for the chinese shark fin market
7073187 sharks have shaped evolution in our oceans for 450 million years
7073188 and their diminishment has already been the cause of severe damage to global oceanic eco systems shark species extinctions will cause irreparable damage if we cant save the sharks we will fail to save our oceans and if our oceans die civilization and humanity will die lush and sea shepherd recognize that we need to save the sharks if we are to save ourselves and we are working together to make this happen
7073189 lush is a campaigning company and we have already tackled issues such as animal testing and over packaging but with 100 million sharks being killed every year and time fast running out for the remaining 10 of the global shark population the campaign against shark finning and longlining is perhaps our biggest challenge yet
7073190 lush have over 550 stores in more than 50 countries and we will be campaigning on this issue in all of them but the nature of the global campaign very much depends on the decision made by the queensland department of primary industries and fisheries in australia next month if it goes against the sharks we will know who the target of our campaign will be
7073191 leaders and communities in these pivotal states and in other states at risk in the sahel horn of africa and southeast asia are already facing enormous political social demographic economic and security challenges climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
7073192 over the last few months we have witnessed harrowing images of people struck by natural hazards in the most disparate parts of the world including hurricane ivan in madagascar severe drought in parts of south and east asia and most recently cyclone nargis in myanmar
7073193 the likelihood of floods violent storms and droughts resulting in disasters is determined by a number of factors including timely access to proper equipment information and the capacity to exert political influence
7073194 the striking lack of these explains why poor people especially those in marginalized social groups like pastoralists in africa women and children constitute the vast majority of disaster victims
7073195 however these hazards will not necessarily cause a corresponding rise in disasters if world leaders act now
7073196 climate change is a wake up call for all of us
7073197 we must avoid relying exclusively on quick fixes like food aid that are necessary but do not address the underlying causes of the emergency and most importantly we ought to help people get back on their feet as soon as possible after the disaster has been tackled
7073198 an alle die unseren kindern das antun fahrt zur h lle
7073199 o noua cultura urbana a aparut pe zidurile marilor orase stencilul firmele il folosesc ca pe o forma de promovare foarte ieftina
7073200 while no one has complained yet my first response would not be to take it down
7073201 the cold war ended nearly 20 years ago but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to launch within a matter of minutes
7073202 it is scary we need a public debate about u s nuclear weapons policy and thats why we developed these ads
7073203 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like denver
7073204 senator obama its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
7073205 we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles globally
7073206 it is essential that all children regardless of where they are born have the opportunity to be vaccinated against measles so that they can grow up healthier and without fear of this highly contagious but entirely preventable disease
7073207 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7073208 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7073209 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7073210 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7073211 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7073212 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7073213 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7073214 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7073215 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7073216 colleges and universities are key places for demonstrating to society how to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the major culprit of global warming
7073217 chill out recognizes and celebrates the schools which are leading the way to a more sustainable future
7073218 the illegal new goshawk guidelines allow logging big trees at the peril of mature forests and wildlife across two states
7073219 were relieved that the forest services analysis demonstrated that their own new guidelines are illegal
7073220 if the new rule cant be used legally here it cant be used in any arizona or new mexico national forest
7073221 todays decision confirms what weve been saying for a year now the new rule is illegal it would harm public forests and wildlife and it should be formally withdrawn
7073222 i still worry that some environmental groups can still challenge us on whether we are correctly interpreting forest plan guidelines as they were originally intended
7073223 i know there is going to be some worry about the interpretation lets just make sure we do quality nepa and other analysis on the first ones
7073224 in a region perilously unable to restore millions of acres of degraded forests this comes as an astounding distraction that threatens fragile agreements upon which restoration ultimately depends
7073225 the irony here is that major restoration industry players and environmentalists agree on the need to protect large trees and in other parts of the southwest that agreement is yielding good restoration
7073226 but as if a century of mismanaging forests werent enough the coconino national forest now stands in the way of those forests restoration by insisting on logging big trees
7073227 a do you want to die god is going to throw you into the ocean and drown you for doing that
7073228 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7073229 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7073230 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7073231 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7073232 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7073233 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7073234 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7073235 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7073236 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7073237 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7073238 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7073239 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7073240 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7073241 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7073242 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7073243 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7073244 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7073245 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7073246 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7073247 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7073248 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7073249 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7073250 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7073251 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7073252 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7073253 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7073254 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7073255 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7073256 as more prices fall there are more homes with no equity said the director of real estate research council at cal poly pomona
7073257 if you have no equity in your property and prices are falling you have no incentive but to walk away
7073258 the sharp and sudden drop of the southland median price reflects a combination of factors mainly depreciation especially in areas hammered by foreclosures and a big shift in the types of homes selling
7073259 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7073260 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7073261 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7073262 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7073263 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7073264 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7073265 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7073266 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7073267 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7073268 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7073269 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7073270 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7073271 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7073272 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7073273 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7073274 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7073275 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7073276 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7073277 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7073278 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7073279 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7073280 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7073281 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7073282 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7073283 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7073284 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7073285 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7073286 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7073287 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7073288 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7073289 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7073290 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7073291 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7073292 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7073293 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7073294 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7073295 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7073296 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7073297 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7073298 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7073299 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7073300 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7073301 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7073302 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7073303 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7073304 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7073305 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7073306 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7073307 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7073308 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7073309 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7073310 this is a planning took where all things are going
7073311 she cant be vp because she said bad things about obama
7073312 independent somebody who is able to say to me you know what mr
7073313 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
7073314 it is unconscionable for the democratic leadership to allow the head of a group that is connected to terrorism and that spreads hate against others to participate in a political convention we demand that mattson be disinvited from speaking at the democratic convention immediately isna and mattson should be condemned for their actions
7073315 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7073316 when you see business flowing in regularly you tend to get a little lazy
7073317 the catholic church exists to make jesus known the bring the will of men and women into alignment with gods will through a relationship with jesus christ the son of god the church has a vital role in building peace and reconciliation promoting justice and defending creation but she does that first by proclaiming the whole council of god
7073318 people who take god seriously will not remain silent about their faith they will often disagree about doctrine or policy but they wont be quiet for catholics the common good can never mean muting themselves in public debate on foundational issues of faith or human dignity christian faith is always personal but never private
7073319 petitioner chevron is ordered to pay the amount of p893 781 768 21 plus six percent legal interest per annum accruing from the date of promulgation of this decision until its finality
7073320 there was a calculated and preconceived course of action adopted by petitioner purposely to evade the payment of the correct customs duties then prevailing
7073321 this was done in collusion with the former district collector who allowed the acceptance of the late ieirds and the collection of duties using the three percent declared rate
7073322 a clear indication of petitioners deliberate intention to defraud the government was its non disclosure of discrepancies on the duties in the import entry declaration ieds which is 10 percent and ieirds which is three percent covering the shipments
7073323 it was not by sheer coincidence that by the time petitioner filed its ieirds way beyond the mandated period the rate of duty had already been reduced
7073324 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7073325 the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
7073326 as a governor i know the value of having reliable partners who are willing to tackle tough challenges in washington the failed economic policies of the last 8 years have left states across the country struggling with budget shortfalls even here in virginia we are facing tough economic times an obama biden administration will give me and governors across the country the kind of partnership we need to deliver results for americas working families
7073327 while families across america are looking for results and solutions oriented leaders senator john mccain offers more of the same failed policies of the last eight years the obama biden ticket offers americans a clear choice and a real opportunity for change

7073343 theres not a lot of time to build up so we might have to be creative how we build him up were not exactly sure how were going to do it
7073344 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7073345 it looks like the shell has been eroded away by acid
7073346 we dont have enough of a handle on the mechanism causing the disease
7073347 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7073348 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7073349 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7073350 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the
7073351 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7073352 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7073353 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and
7073354 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7073355 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7073356 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7073357 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7073358 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7073359 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7073360 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7073361 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7073362 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7073363 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7073364 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7073365 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7073366 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7073367 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7073368 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7073369 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7073370 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7073371 theres nothing like being in a big league clubhouse and earning your way back
7073372 i cant say enough about the opportunity ive been given
7073373 today is a big start for me and the team
7073374 ive lived the frustration and disappointments of letting myself down and my team down yeah its disheartening but ive been through other adversity in my career youve just go to keep moving on ive got enough time in the major leagues and in baseball to know that youve got to have a short memory youve got to move on quick or this game will take you down
7073375 theres always an urgency to win especially this time of year and we definitely have goals ahead of us that we need to attain and thats wins i want to be a big part of that
7073376 i expect to go out and compete definitely be aggressive my command i feel has been really good and go out there and throw strikes thats what ive done in the past
7073377 im not looking for other things to go wrong and i dont expect them
7073378 its just another charm offensive to get the shamans off their backs
7073379 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
7073380 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

7073407 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7073408 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7073409 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7073410 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7073411 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
7073412 so if they should have the need to evacuate city for a weather related or terrorist or any other situation they needed to have a program or a plan in place for sheltering the folks during part of the evacuation and obviously along with sheltering comes feeding
7073413 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7073414 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7073415 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7073416 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7073417 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7073418 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7073419 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7073420 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
7073421 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7073422 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7073423 i think obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7073424 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7073425 it should be passed on wednesday and judges should be restored
7073426 without him the restoration of the judiciary will be a joke
7073427 the biggest problem we face is militancy in the north west frontier province
7073428 there is great resentment in the southwestern baluchistan province against the federation the economy is a shambles
7073429 there are far more important issues than the restoration of judiciary
7073430 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis
7073431 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
7073432 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
7073433 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
7073434 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource
7073435 when peoples access to clean drinking water is reliant on the profit interests of a handful of transnationals all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty
7073436 if the bank is truly interested in alleviating poverty its conditions should take a longer view

7073528 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7073529 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7073530 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7073531 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7073532 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7073533 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge he seems like he was having an easy day today
7073534 good intentions dont always produce good movies and outrage however justified can cloud argument
7073535 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7073536 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7073537 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7073538 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7073539 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7073540 in our sport we dont have photo finishes like in athletics in our sport its who touches first water is a different element
7073541 if it makes you feel better you can rationalize obamas missing 10 point lead on the basis of clintonite sulkiness his slowness in responding to attacks or the concern that obama may be too handsome brilliant and cool to be elected but lets be honest if you break the numbers down the reason obama isnt ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group older white voters he does so for a simple reason the color of his skin much evidence points to racial prejudice as a factor that could be large enough to cost obama the election

7073544 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7073545 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7073546 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7073547 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act

7073570 the best way to oust politicians from office is to vote them out on election day not to remove them through term limits like those imposed in new york city
7073571 the mayor rudy giuliani should make clear to council members that he will reject any bill that would end term limits in such a shabby backdoor manner instead he should support council speaker peter vallones view that the only honorable way to get rid of term limits is through the same route they appeared in the first place a citywide referendum

7073722 un da o ambiental efectuado al patrimonio fiscal y a todos los chilenos y lo que corresponde es que haga valer el estado de derecho por parte de la empresa y su mandante y se apliquen las medidas punitivas que correspondan
7073723 y tambi n es necesario que se explique claramente a la ciudadan a c mo fue la expropiaci n de la franja fiscal por parte de bienes nacionales para un camino privado que a su t rmino s lo servir a a energ a austral y su proyecto adem s como fue que los organismos del estado se prestan para ayudar a evadir seia con funcionarios p blicos y recursos fiscales
7073724 tenemos el desierto de atacama que es uno de los lugares que tiene la mayor radiaci n de todo el mundo y resulta que no estamos haciendo nada
7073725 en los ltimos dos a os la energ a solar es la que ha tenido el mayor y m s vertiginoso desarrollo tecnol gico donde se han invertido billones de d lares en innovaci n investigaci n y desarrollo y es la energ a que ha tenido la curva m s r pida de disminuci n de costos y mejoramiento tecnol gico
7073726 como tendencia la energ a solar va a ser probablemente de las renovables la que compita m s seriamente con los combustibles f siles en el muy corto plazo estamos hablando de aqu a unos cinco a os
7073727 en un lapso de dos o tres a os se producir el cambio tecnol gico que permitir una fuerte baja en los costos de producci n
7073728 queremos que en diez a os estemos absolutamente posicionados como uno de los polos de desarrollo importante y para llegar a eso tenemos que comenzar desde ya a hacer cosas
7073729 que nos permita hacer cosas un poquito m s sofisticadas pretendemos tener un grupo de gente instalada en la regi n con infraestructura tecnol gica montada empezar a hacer pruebas prototipos alternativas tecnol gicas m s avanzadas probadas y eficientes
7073730 no vamos a forzar la cosas porque no hay subsidios por lo menos hoy no y tampoco incentivos m s all de los que est n en la ley de energ as renovables que parte de las energ as que compran las distribuidoras provenga de fuentes renovables pero creemos que hay posibilidades de que se vayan formando plantas peque itas tambi n a escalas demostrativas en aquellos casos en que sea competitiva no queremos hacer algo que despu s vaya a quedar botado porque nadie lo quiere operar
7073731 no es s lo producir energ a sino equipamiento paneles solares partes y piezas que se puedan usar en chile y tambi n empresas que puedan exportar desde aqu hacia el mundo aprovechando la red de tratados de libre comercio la idea es que al final de los diez a os tengamos lo que se llama un cluster de energ as renovables donde est n empresas de toda la cadena de valor instaladas en la zona produciendo dando servicios instalando exportando tecnolog as form ndose capital humano especializado con programas de formaci n etc tera
7073732 si uno tomara el 1 de la superficie de la regi n de atacama que son 7 500 hect reas podr a generarse electricidad del orden de los 3 000 mw o sea m s que hidroays n
7073733 instrumentar mediante un mecanismo gil y transparente licitaciones p blicas de adquisici n de t tulos
7073734 aporte potencial de las energ as renovables no convencionales ernc y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica del sic 2008 2025
7073735 comenzamos en 1996 instalando unos cientos de paneles solares al a o
7073736 ahora colocamos 8 000 al mes nos hab amos propuesto llegar a un mill n en 2015 pero lo superaremos en 2010
7073737 su costo es de unos 400 d lares al a o pero no pedimos una entrega inicial aceptamos una peque a cantidad por adelantado y nuestros ingenieros cobran el resto en un plazo de dos o m s a os
7073738 el queroseno de las l mparas es caro y da a el ambiente este sistema nos permite dar luz a las viviendas por las noches para que los ni os puedan estudiar y a los comerciantes mantener su negocio
7073739 esto va m s all de una linda idea o del concepto de nicho de mercado
7073740 estamos llegando a un punto de inflexi n despu s del cual esta tecnolog a beneficiar a millones de personas
7073741 es llamativo que todos los programas se hayan desarrollado en un plazo significativo en siete casos fue de 10 a os o m s eso permiti crear experiencia en el mbito local cadenas de suministros y la permanente incorporaci n de nuevos enfoques e ideas
7073742 estuvieron a cargo de personas que estuvieron desde el principio y la continuidad del liderazgo y su perspectiva pueden haber desempe ado un papel significativo
7073743 esto es importante para la salud la educaci n y la disminuci n de la pobreza el alza del petr leo y la demanda creciente hacen dif cil que los sistemas energ ticos centralizados llenen el vac o
7073744 las tecnolog as tienen beneficios ambientales significativos como reducir las emisiones de di xido de carbono y la deforestaci n pero tambi n consecuencias sociales y econ micas transforman la vida de sus beneficiarios mediante mejores ingresos salud seguridad alimentaria aire m s puro y m s oportunidades para estudiar
7073745 eso es porque los costos iniciales de las nuevas tecnolog as como los paneles solares pueden ser una barrera aun si el alto precio del queroseno y de otros alternativas signifique que el plazo de reembolso sea sorprendentemente corto
7073746 esta cuesti n no se nos ha planteado jam s y si se nos preguntara en el futuro lo rechazaremos
7073747 oh no thats not what im looking for at all
7073748 estados unidos estaba muy rezagado pero la naci n no se rindi
7073749 alemania tiene m s de 240 000 puestos de trabajo en ese sector
7073750 es el nico camino para resolver los dos mayores problemas que enfrenta el mundo la energ a y el cambio clim tico
7073751 sin energ a nada funciona por lo que la humanidad se encamina inevitablemente a una era de conflictos sangrientos
7073752 es completamente posible que un pa s como alemania obtenga la totalidad de su energ a de fuentes renovables hemos hecho estudios que lo demuestran
7073753 como canad emplea intensamente la energ a hidroel ctrica podr a ser el primer pa s que s lo se abastezca de fuentes renovables
7073754 el p blico y el sector de la energ a renovable tendr n que presionar duramente a los gobiernos para que las cosas cambien
7073755 cuando en un estado de derecho se aplica una ley injusta la l gica indica que la ley debe inclinarse ante la justicia y no ante el derecho
7073756 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more
7073757 fight all you want you cant get out of those
7073758 you might be a little dizzy still it takes some adjustment to come back from that particular spell
7073759 ah but you are infinitely more than that to the king you are well favored
7073760 who are you why do you hide yourself and where are my men and my clothes
7073761 i know not the whereabouts of your men currently or whether they live to tell of their failure to protect you if they did survive no doubt your father will see to their execution they are no longer a concern to you your highness as for your clothes you do not need them for what i have in mind you are my prisoner and are mine to do with as i please
7073762 as for who i am your highness we met once though i think you do not recall me it was a year ago at your fathers court
7073763 n s tivemos uma dificuldade no s bado passado que foi a parte da interven o que ficou para o lado da via do lado do bairro e a mudan a do eixo do canteiro central n o possibilitou a n s fazermos uma via de m o dupla na parte que n o foi interditada que foi a parte da praia porque o eixo do canteiro central mudou cerca de 1 80m para o lado da praia e isso afunilou e por isso n o tivemos espa o para trabalhar em duplo sentido
7073764 eu acho que todo as pessoas de vit ria j t m na cabe a as melhores rotas para desviar desse tr nsito n o a primeira vez que a gente passa por transforma es na dante michelini essa situa o n o nada incomum
7073765 uno ve los resultados y son alarmantes para el sector del turismo muchas empresas no sobrevivir an por lo menos durante el per odo de construcci n si se aprueban los proyectos de hidroays n y transelec
7073766 impacto de los proyectos de represas en ays n en el desarrollo del turismo de la regi n
7073767 encontramos que hay una percepci n muy favorable respecto del atractivo tur stico de ays n que se traduce en que m s de un 95 por ciento de quienes vienen dice que volver a a la regi n y casi un 99 por ciento se ala que la recomendar a a otras personas siendo lo que m s valoran la baja intervenci n humana la belleza de los paisajes la diversidad de los paisajes existentes y por lo mismo el ser un lugar nico que hace muy atractivo venir para ac
7073768 uno ve los resultados y son alarmantes para el sector del turismo porque habla de una baja en visitas de casi un 40 a 50 por ciento y muchas empresas no van a sobrevivir por lo menos durante el per odo de construcci n si se aprueban los proyectos de hidroays n y transelec
7073769 para buscar estrategias para manejar el cambio lo cual ser a muy dif cil y complejo por lo cual el estudio es muy positivo y objetivo
7073770 no existe una legislaci n ambiental especial que proteja los glaciares o que norme su manejo
7073771 de que la cordillera de chile central cubre varios miles de kil metros cuadrados
7073772 la potencial contaminaci n del hielo subterr neo por aguas contaminadas
7073773 seg n mis investigaciones y los propios estudios de impacto ambiental de proyectos de expansi n mineros hasta 1997 se removieron 0 5 km de glaciares rocosos en divisi n andina y 0 2 km en los bronces
7073774 la parte central superior de este tremendo glaciar de 2 5 km de largo fue cubierta de 14 millones de toneladas de roca est ril a partir de agosto de 1990
7073775 no destacan la importancia de estos glaciares como su rol hidrol gico
7073776 las autoridades ambientales sab an de la destrucci n de glaciares rocosos por lo menos desde 2001
7073777 el desarrollo minero en la cuenca alta del r o blanco ha implicado la remoci n principalmente de glaciares de roca desde el a o 1982 aproximadamente un 38 de los glaciares de roca del rea de influencia del proyecto han sido cubiertos por dep sitos de roca est ril indicando que la contribuci n h drica de glaciares rocosos es nula mi interpretaci n es que no se han considerado las contribuciones de agua subterr nea
7073778 falta de conocimiento sobre el medio ambiente de alta monta a
7073779 los derechos de agua del r o manso tienen un valor de mercado de 46 millones de d lares cu nto valen los que hidroays n tiene en el baker y el pascua
7073780 se hagan cargo no s lo del valor real de los derechos de agua que obtuvieron ileg timamente gratis y a perpetuidad sino tambi n que asuman los perjuicios econ micos que tanto las represas como el tendido el ctrico asociado generar an en la regi n de ays n las comunidades y el turismo entre otras actividades productivas
7073781 el resultado del remate de las aguas del r o manso para fines hidroel ctricos al cual se opuso tenazmente endesa espa a socia de colb n en el proyecto hidroays n demuestra que el negocio que tienen entre manos en los r os baker y pascua no se condice con las migajas que ofrecen a los habitantes de ays n
7073782 fue el peor negocio que la regi n y el pa s pod a hacer y el cual no se condice con la m nima oferta de empleo capacitaci n e incluso rebajas de energ a que ofrece la compa a a los ayseninos como compensaci n
7073783 asuman el valor real y de mercado de los derechos de agua que obtuvieron gratis y a perpetuidad sino tambi n que asuman los perjuicios econ micos que tanto las represas como el tendido el ctrico asociado generar an en la regi n de ays n y chile las comunidades y el turismo entre otras actividades productivas
7073784 el precio de este remate pone de manifiesto la necesidad de que el pa s analice con mayor detenci n la institucionalidad del agua puesto que tenemos una prueba manifiesta de que el mecanismo v a remate ha permitido asignarle un precio de mercado a un bien que en la mayor a de los casos es asignado por el estado de manera gratuita a los solicitantes
7073785 el estudio de impacto ambiental eia la idea es presentarlo dentro de los primeros 15 d as del mes de agosto y eso est de acuerdo al programa y no ha cambiado nada la idea original es presentarlo el 14 de agosto no creo que cambie eso salvo que hidroays n determine lo contrario
7073786 los montos de inversi n no est n definidos los montos se van a conocer en definitiva cuando se abran las licitaciones todo lo que hay hoy d a son estimaciones y las estimaciones esencialmente las mismas debidamente alteradas evidentemente por lo que pueda haber ocurrido con el precio de las materias primas y todo lo dem s hoy d a siguen lo que vale la tendencia natural de lo que valen los proyectos hidr ulicos en el mundo
7073787 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7073788 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7073789 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7073790 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7073791 nos pusimos a trabajar hace dos a os cuando se impuls el tema de las energ as renovables nos dedicamos a acumular informaci n para demostrar que la opci n era factible
7073792 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7073793 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7073794 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7073795 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7073796 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

7073801 10 000 money making websites that will rock your world
7073802 damn son i wish i had the stuff you have now when i was your age we didnt have fancy stuff like this back then
7073803 7 websites my 65 years old grandma wish knew 40 years ago
7073804 w e havent been able to break their intellectual appeal that they seem to still have
7073805 large numbers of the intellectual elite and civil liberties bodies provide a backup to the movement in terms of agitprop and other activities
7073806 are still able to get support of intellectual classes is disturbing unless we can divorce the two defeating the maoists is not that easy
7073807 we have not seen any kind of infusion of arms or ammunition
7073808 educated elite that gives them a connection to the outside world
7073809 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7073810 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7073811 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7073812 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7073813 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7073814 challenge yourself about everything in 30 days with these five amazing sites
7073815 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment

7073817 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
7073818 for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle
7073819 laos parang on ma bahenon muna tu hula hula muan
7073820 for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle
7073821 first a deductive research can be quicker to complete second data collection is often based on one take and third this approach can be a lower risk strategy
7073822 do you believe that the quality of service in most hotel restaurants in sheffield is good
7073823 i always talk about the triple t tradition talent and training
7073824 we have an extremely good school system in our primary schools physical education is mandatory and we actually start competing from early childhood we have our prep school championships primary school championships our secondary school championships
7073825 there are a lot of fast twitch fibres in jamaica
7073826 if the talent pool is of high standard then you dont necessarily need huge numbers of people involved
7073827 if you then have a competitive environment in which to develop that talent and you can keep the most promising kids running track and not lose them to other sports like football cricket or basketball then youre in a good position
7073828 contrast that with the situation in britain where we struggle to keep kids with pace strength and power involved in athletics
7073829 like the usa is noted for basketball we are noted with track and field
7073830 for this olympics weve put up big screens in the towns and heavily populated areas so everyone can watch everybody has just stopped working to watch the races its a great moment in time for us
7073831 jamaica is a small island and well always see emigration as a major activity but these days the majority of our top athletes are home grown and home trained and home developed
7073832 were also getting better prepared both in terms of individual coaches and how we put the team together and create our olympic camp
7073833 this year we moulded them together as a team the team management have been excellent helping everyone to bond success
7073834 theres a comparison to be drawn with kenya and its distance runners
7073835 great athletes tend to develop around other great athletes its very rare to find someone develop into a world class performer on their own
7073836 we have had an anti doping programme for a very long time we were one of the earliest signatures to the wada convention weve had a little delay in terms of our national anti doping programme but that has in no way affected the programme we have in place for our elite athletes
7073837 there has always been a strong programme for high performance athletes and that will continue
7073838 without naming names some of our athletes here have been tested three times in four days to my mind thats ridiculous thats not an anti doping programme thats harassment
7073839 obviously what the competition does has an impact on our success but you have to remember that weve had three world records in all of this
7073840 let them come it will excite the crowd a little more
7073841 a lot of yam banana and dumplings produce top three
7073842 does this represent an overall shift in strategy do they have to find a new path to 270 electoral votes does this represent a sign of things to come in other states is the obama campaign planning to close down offices in states they have initially targeted
7073843 in naming my colleague and friend senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7073844 will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the
7073845 its sad and its a sure way to guarantee the republicans will win
7073846 shell go in shell wow them and shell get out of the way
7073847 delegates may vote for the candidate of their choice whether or not the name of such candidate was placed in nomination
7073848 the great things about ning is that even though we dont offer this functionality there are 3rd party developers out there meeting those needs or with a little php and css you can customize it all you want
7073849 more things grow in the garden than the gardener sows
7073850 we find the best blowjobs and provide you with vids and pics daily for your enjoyment
7073851 the first time i saw tracks that did it for me
7073852 myself and another guy found tracks that were 15 inches long and seven inches wide at the toes not overwhelmingly big
7073853 we dont tell people where were going and you find footprints where people arent going to go walking
7073854 i found these footprints in a patch of poison ivy someone is not going to run through the woods barefoot in a patch of poison ivy
7073855 one of the theories is they and humans have evolved on a parallel line if theyre as smart as us it would be pretty easy for them to hide
7073856 i think more people are seeing these creatures than what theyre saying
7073857 one of the things id like people to know is to not be afraid to come out if theyve seen something
7073858 i went and followed the creek for about a mile each way and found nothing i think it was a hoax

7073861 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7073862 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7073863 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan

7073865 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7073866 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7073867 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7073868 you can do it without money but obviously it helps it gives you space
7073869 well not you but it always seems to be professors or doctors that drive these cars
7073870 the u s demonstrated its leadership in 1997 when congress passed and president clinton signed into law the no electronic theft and the digital millennium copyright acts
7073871 like many other members of congress on the relatively infrequent occasions when he does talk about intellectual property his focus is on piracy
7073872 the group didnt recommend any specific sanctions against the countries but biden repeated an often heard line on the hill at the time
7073873 our ideas our music our books our movies our innovations are just as precious as any tangible property he said
7073874 dependo demasiado de la suerte para conseguir un buen resultado
7073875 a lo largo del fin de semana no ha habido accidentes pero varios pilotos han estado cerca de rozar el muro y si eso pasa en carrera implicar necesariamente la aparici n en pista del coche de seguridad
7073876 a lo largo del fin de semana no ha habido ning n accidente fuerte y esperemos que siga todo igual pero varios pilotos han estado cerca de rozar el muro y si eso pasa en carrera implicar necesariamente la aparici n en pista del coche de seguridad
7073877 hoy no hemos sido suficientemente r pidos tenemos que mejorar empezando por la carrera de ma ana otras veces hemos logrado entrar en la q3 por d cimas pero en esta ocasi n nos ha tocado a nosotros quedarnos fuera no se ha podido hacer m s
7073878 la de ma ana ser una carrera en la que estamos en manos del coche de seguridad y de que aparezca cuando ya hayamos repostado de lo contrario s lo podremos finalizar en octava o novena posici n algo que no da demasiadas satisfacciones
7073879 hoy hice tres intentos al l mite el mejor y el peor estuvieron separados por dos d cimas as que es evidente que ah est mi limite no puedo esperar un milagro para ganar un segundo de repente es una pena porque estamos corriendo en casa
7073880 tenemos m s flexibilidad creo que los neum ticos pueden aguantar a una sola parada
7073881 quiz vayamos a elegir una estrategia a una sola parada y cruzando los dedos para que el coche de seguridad aparezca en el momento adecuado
7073882 la segunda plaza es una buena base para ma ana
7073883 el equipo hizo un gran trabajo y conf o en que seremos fuertes en la carrera
7073884 gran coche y que no habr a problemas en la calificaci n
7073885 la primera vuelta no fue perfecta porque al menos perd un segundo comparado con la siguiente pero en la ltima todo fue mejor
7073886 despu s de algunas carreras desafortunadas ltimamente el comportamiento del coche aqu en valencia no es malo
7073887 sin embargo todav a hay una peque a desventaja con ferrari y mclaren
7073888 el compuesto duro para la primera calificaci n y el blando para las otras dos
7073889 ten a dudas sobre mi futuro pero guardiola me dijo que confiaba en m
7073890 el entrenador tiene muy claro como quiere que juegue el equipo conoce el club y al entorno
7073891 ten a dudas sobre mi futuro pero tras hablar con guardiola me dijo que confiaba en m y que cre a que pod a ayudar mucho al equipo
7073892 yo solo quer a seguir si el entrenador confiaba en m y si pod a aportar algo al equipo
7073893 hay muchos centrocampistas en el equipo pero todos con diferentes cualidades
7073894 el equipo necesita a todos los jugadores en plena forma
7073895 hemos visto cambios durante la pretemporada el entrenador tiene muy claro como quiere que juegue el equipo conoce el club y al entorno
7073896 busquets v ctor v zquez y jeffren han demostrado que pueden ayudarnos en cualquier momento lo importante es que todos los jugadores estemos a nuestro mejor nivel
7073897 are the license plates personalized whats the best car to have here why do the sheep look like they had food coloring dumped on them
7073898 dos fuentes allegadas a clinton se alaron que obama jam s le pidi a clinton la documentaci n financiera y otros registros que son necesarios en el proceso de selecci n el examen detallado del pasado de un potencial compa ero de f rmula que procura evitar sorpresas desagradables despu s del anuncio
7073899 a clinton nunca la examinaron no se le pidi un solo documento y ella y el senador obama jam s tuvieron una sola conversaci n acerca de la posibilidad de que ella fuese vicepresidenta
7073900 encendi las cr ticas de simpatizantes de la senadora en el sentido de que esto fue un gesto de desprecio hacia la ex primera dama cuyos seguidores amenazan con una ruidosa manifestaci n de descontento en la convenci n
7073901 sin duda ser vista por algunos como que no se le trata con el respeto debido
7073902 el martirio de m s de 70 inocentes en su mayor a ni os y mujeres

7073904 las fuerzas de la coalici n ponen todo su empe o en prevenir la p rdida de vidas inocentes se ha abierto una investigaci n
7073905 estados unidos y la otan han tomado medidas para evitar la muerte de civiles yo ser a prudente con las primeras informaciones procedentes de afganist n
7073906 los talibanes y los grupos extremistas a menudo son muy r pidos para llegar a los lugares de bombardeo ndlr despu s acusan a estados unidos y a sus aliados de los atentados que ellos mismos han cometido

7073909 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7073910 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7073911 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7073912 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7073913 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7073914 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7073915 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind

7073958 oh worthless why do i do this to my god
7073959 si uno escribe sin garra sin entusiasmo sin amor sin divertirse nicamente es un escritor a medias pues el primer deber de un escritor es la efusi n ser una criatura de fiebres y arrebatos sin ese vigor lo mismo dar a que cosechase melocotones o cavara zanjas dios sabe que vivir a m s sano
7073960 no escribir para muchos de nosotros es morir si uno no escribiese todos los d as uno acumular a veneno y empezar a a morir o desquiciarse o las dos cosas uno tiene que mantenerse borracho de escritura para que la realidad no lo destruya porque escribir facilita las recetas adecuadas de verdad vida y realidad que permiten comer beber y digerir sin hiperventilarse y caer en la cama como un pez muerto
7073961 la historia entera de la humanidad consiste en solucionar problemas la ciencia ficci n devora ideas las dirige y nos dice c mo sobrevivir una cosa acompa a a la otra sin la fantas a no hay realidad sin estudios sobre p rdidas no hay ganancias sin imaginaci n no hay voluntad sin sue os imposibles no hay posibles soluciones toda ciencia ficci n es un intento de resolver problemas mientras se finge mirar para otro lado en otro lugar he descrito este proceso literario como el enfrentamiento de perseo con la medusa con los ojos en la imagen de medusa reflejada en su escudo de bronce mientras finge desviar la mirada perseo lanza el brazo por sobre el hombro y decapita al monstruo as la ciencia ficci n simula futuros a fin de curar perros enfermos en los caminos de hoy el tropo lo es todo la met fora es el remedio al parecer pues somos todos ni os de ciencia ficci n que so amos nuevas formas de supervivencia de nuevo esa verdad la historia de las ideas no otra cosa ha sido siempre la ciencia ficci n ideas alumbr ndose a s mismas en hechos muriendo s lo para reinventar nuevos sue os e ideas y renacer en formas y figuras a n m s fascinantes algunas permanentes todas con una promesa de supervivencia
7073962 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7073963 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7073964 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7073965 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7073966 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7073967 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7073968 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail

7073972 the biggest surprise for me in this film was that the iranian women didnt seem that oppressed
7073973 we figured out that people with disabilities enjoy beading and having a job
7073974 we knew we could create meaningful employment that would give them a sense of pride and when people are doing something they like you dont have the behavioral issues
7073975 if you have one applicant who has a degree and one who has a disability who are you going to hire
7073976 we find what works best for each person but we also teach them valuable job skills
7073977 most special needs people are very sensory oriented so tactile work fits their strengths the act of sanding and feeling the texture of the wood is calming and gives an immediate sense of accomplishment
7073978 you want to set them up for success not failure
7073979 part of the process is addressing issues they may have in the work environment
7073980 people ask us all the time if they really do all the work and they really do
7073981 they know how to stay on task follow instructions and do all the hammering nailing sanding and staining
7073982 there are many employers that dont know the value of a special needs adult and how they can help them in their business
7073983 our students dont just learn about furniture and jewelry they learn how to be a good team player and develop social skills while gaining self confidence and life skills
7073984 its not just a job making jewelry and candles is really satisfying and quality work improves your quality of life
7073985 after interrogating them we have come to know that the training camps were conducted in kerala and this conspiracy was planned there in which safdar nagori and his associates were involved on the basis of which we are bringing him and his associates we will bring nagori by sunday and four of his associates namely karimuddin nagori ameel pervez shibly and mohammad hafiz are being produced today

7073990 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7073991 that is why i felt it was right for me to submit the resignation to the governor
7073992 if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum
7073993 people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves
7073994 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
7073995 secession of a part of the territory of india from the union includes the assertion of any claim to determine whether such part will remain a part of the territory of india
7073996 which is intended or supports any claim to bring about on any ground whatsoever the cession of a part of the territory of india or the secession of a part of the territory of india from the union or which incites any individual or group of individuals to bring about such cession or secession

7074118 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7074119 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation

7074142 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7074143 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7074144 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7074145 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7074146 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area

7074148 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7074149 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7074150 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7074151 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7074152 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7074153 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7074154 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7074155 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7074192 ich habe eine menge zeit in diese firma gesteckt sie bedeutet mir viel
7074193 wir sind nicht da wo wir stehen sollten das gilt f r alle von uns ob das nun chip juan pablo mich oder die crewchiefs betrifft
7074194 keiner will au erhalb der top 35 liegend nach daytona fahren
7074195 ich war auch noch niemals in solch einer position und ich glaube auch nicht dass ich in so einer position sein will
7074196 dies ist eine strecke die etwas besser zu unserem auto passt wir verstehen das auto besser und besser was uns hilft wir werden dieses jahr keine gro en schritte mehr machen aber es ist auch f r das kommende jahr wichtig dass aktuelle auto zu verstehen
7074197 wenn du nicht wei t warum du langsam bist dann ist es ein problem wenn man die probleme kennt und wei dass man diese mit einem berschaubaren aufwand beheben kann dann ist das positiv es werden noch ein paar neue dinge kommen vor allem f r spa aber das wichtigste ist meiner meinung nach dass wir f r das kommende jahr lernen
7074198 ich glaube auch an meine st rke dass ich technisch mittlerweile auf einem guten stand bin ich dem team weiterhelfen kann so wie jetzt mit den aerodynamischen sachen ich sitze im auto und sp re wo es hapert da habe ich sehr intensiv druck gemacht es ist schon positiv zu sehen dass sie es respektieren und dann auch in diese richtung gehen
7074199 es ist nat rlich immer so dass man denkt dass man gerne einmal dieses schnelle auto da vorne fahren w rde wenn man hinterher gurkt
7074200 ich habe nicht mclaren gesagt sondern dieses schnelle auto das k nnte also auch ferrari oder bmw sein
7074201 in bezug auf die technik ist es f r ihn fast unm glich weiterzuhelfen da er nicht ber die erfahrung verf gt aber ich muss sagen dass er das auto sehr gut versteht er hat einen klaren kopf auf der strecke wei was das auto tut das ist schon einmal der erste schritt der sehr wichtig ist
7074202 der asphalt ist sehr eben von der abstimmung her fast wie eine normale rennstrecke mit dem staub auf der strecke ist es nicht allzu schlimm ich musste im freien training heute morgen einmal au en herum fahren weil die beiden renault da so langsam fuhren ich fuhr au en in einer schnellen kurve vorbei das war eigentlich kein problem
7074203 es ist immer noch anders wenn du in die echte situation mit der echten strecke kommst zum beispiel ist jeder randstein wichtig ich wei es nicht ich bin mir nicht sicher ein bisschen hat es schon geholfen wie viel ist jedoch schwierig zu sagen
7074204 die letzte passage k nnte ein thema sein sie ist sehr schnell und dort ist es um die auslaufzonen nicht besonders gut bestellt das k nnte etwas gef hrlich sein denn die kurven sind alle blind im qualifying mussten dort vor der letzten kurve alle warten wenn dort einer steht und man kommt mit hoher geschwindigkeit dort an dann ist das nicht ohne
7074205 es gibt sehr viele blinde kurven kurve 17 ist komplett blind und sehr sehr schnell man wei ja nicht was dahinter ist dort k nnte einer mit einem motorschaden stehen das kann man ja nicht sehen schwierig wie man das verhindern soll in monaco ist es ja auch so
7074206 ich finde es wirklich sensationell f r die atmosph re ist es nat rlich toll wenn man einen stadt kurs hat und die menschen sehr nah an die strecke rankommen aber man muss nat rlich schauen dass sie die strecke so hinbekommen wie hier so dass es nicht zu gef hrlich wird hier handelt es sich um eine normale strecke mitten in der stadt da haben sie tolle arbeit geleistet
7074207 beide reifen sind f r diese strecke etwas zu weich wir haben auch mit dem harten probleme bekommen aber sie waren beide auch irgendwie sehr hnlich wir m ssen mal schauen
7074208 ich bin im qualifying mit dem harten reifen gefahren also sogar im qualifying die tendenz geht also zu hart aber wie gesagt gibt es nur einen sehr geringen unterschied der weiche reifen ist nicht viel zu weich es wird also damit im rennen keine probleme geben es geht nur darum den besten reifen zu finden
7074209 ich habe eine ordentliche menge benzin an bord das sollte also passen

7074232 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7074233 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7074234 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7074235 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7074236 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7074237 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7074238 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations

7074355 de homo was er met zijn twee n zelfs arabisch ogend
7074356 ik voel me tweederangsburger in eigen land omdat ik achterhaalde discussies moet voeren met een in mijn ogen agressieve minderheid die weigert ook maar enig begrip op te brengen voor idealen welke in het gastland gemeengoed zijn wij dienen ons aan u aan te passen u die geen notie heeft van scheiding van kerk amp staat
7074357 ik zou willen wijzen op het onmenselijke van het experiment om mensen uit een totaal ander werelddeel te halen uit een gebied met totaal andere culturele structuren een hele andere levenssfeer en die mensen hier neer te poten en te hopen dat alles goed gaat terwijl die mensen niet aan de slag komen en aan sociale ontreddering ten prooi zijn maar dat de nederlandse overheid in een eivolle stad waar geen werk en geen woonruimte zijn tienduizenden immigranten binnenhaalt dat is misdadig dat noem ik racisme amsterdam kende vrijwel geen racisme maar de regering den uyl heeft het weten te planten
7074358 we zijn pas de laatste 10 jaar begonnen met hun integratie
7074359 als iemand hen bekend dat ie gay is is dat net zoals iemand die hen zou vertellen dat ie een moordenaar is
7074360 ik keur homoseksualiteit af het is niet aangeboren biseksualiteit is helemaal raar voor mij hoeven moslims niet gelukkig te worden als homos gevoelens kunnen er zijn maar het is de kunst de jihad daar niet aan toe te geven je moet het onderdrukken en bestrijden je praktiseert ofwel homoseksualiteit ofwel de zuivere islam allah straft mensen laten voor hun zondige geilheid en slechts een sterk geloof helpt tegen zonden
7074361 ik ben tegen coming out van homos in hun gezin maar deze vuige dames zeggen tegelijk dat zij veel willen spreken seks
7074362 jullie moeten de homoseksuelen in jullie omgeving helpen bij hun strijd tegen hun verboden verlangens bezin je daarop tijdens de komende ramadan want jullie hebben nog een hoop te doen
7074363 het marxistische dogma dat de geschiedenis een opwaartse ontwikkeling kent
7074364 ik ben het volkomen met je eens dat door deze vooronderstelling we onszelf nederlandse democratische cultuur kwetsbaar maken
7074365 t zou me veel geld waard zijn indien je je tot feyenoord zou beperken dat is immers al pijnlijk genoeg

7074368 cheney has essentially been called a co president or by some critics a secret president
7074369 the president of vice president has become much more powerful and certainly anyone who would be looking at taking the number two position on the ticket would certainly think i might have a broader portfolio i might have the opportunity to have a real impact on the administration policies
7074370 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
7074371 geen seks veel drugs en al helemaal geen rock amp roll
7074372 het is zo gek je vergeet echt dat er overal cameras zijn
7074373 het gerucht gaat dat u sbs 6 wilt kapot maken en dan goedkoop wilt overnemen is dat zo
7074374 omdat je kunt presenteren acteren n een blaadje publiceren het calvinisme had nergens anders uitgevonden k nnen worden
7074375 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7074376 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7074377 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7074378 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7074379 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7074380 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7074381 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7074382 ach so we hebben een man van adel in ons midden von der veer
7074383 nee annelies zoiets zullen nederlanders nooit doen dat zit niet in ons dat kunnen alleen de duitsers doen
7074384 en dan laat ik aan tafel mijn besneden snikkel zien
7074385 dat ik t bij mijn oude dag moet opnemen voor de vrije meningsuiting van iemand die in het verleden op alle mogelijke manieren geprobeerd heeft de uitoefening van dat recht voor mijn persoontje onmogelijk te maken doet eens temeer beseffen hoe belangrijk juist het n en ondeelbare van de vrije meningsuiting is alsook het recht op belediging
7074386 ik geef toe t is een beklemmende ervaring maar ik betrap me er de laatste tijd vaker op meneers meningen te delen zoals bijvoorbeeld in het grote satan debat dat zich in nrc handelsblad afspeelde en zijn taxaties terzake het islamitische gevaar misschien word ik oud misschien is t de gesel de mildheid alsook het besef dat de winters pogingen mij te demoniseren als eeuwige anti semiet en ander fraais nooit gelukt zijn juist de rechten van zijn bitterste vijand dient men met overgave te verdedigen
7074387 wat mij wederom mateloos irriteert is dat geloof in casu de islam wordt aangesproken als bron voor domheid agressief gedrag en polarisatie en dat door een joodse heer van stand aldus de godsdienstidiotie erkennend maar vooral bekrachtigend
7074388 gaat over de veranderingen in nederland met betrekking to neo nazis moslims etc
7074389 leon de winter mag geen lectures geven over de situatie in nl want joods
7074390 cohen mag niet bij de herdenking zijn van van gogh want joods
7074391 het echt ongelooflijk dat het stigmatiserend denken in nederland over joden nog niets is veranderd
7074392 ik heb een vermoeden maar dat durf ik niet uit te spreken
7074393 neen dank je geen behoefte aan een laf commentaar achteraf hamid ik zit hier zo mijn tekst lekker te typen terwijl zeker 10 grote zwarte homofiele negers van minstens 100kg over mijn schouders meegenieten ze roepen allen in koor

7074395 van gogh die kon worden wie hij was doordat hij opgroeide in een nederland waarin de jaren zestig meer dan in welk land ook een stempel op de omgangsvormen nalieten
7074396 mohammed b heeft gemoord om te offeren zijn ze dat inamsterdam vergeten er is een bijbelse uitspraak wie een mensredt redt de hele mensheid mohammed b keerde het om ik doodeen mens en daarmee dood ik een hele mensheid dat wil zeggen de ongelovige de mensheid die zegt wat ze wil denkt wat ze wil gelooft wat ze wil dat wil zeggen alle mensen die anders denkendan hijzelf niet alleen de amsterdamse dus als je bij deherdenking van zon moord niet hirsi ali uitnodigt wier film vangogh durfde te maken een film waarvoor hij zijn leven op hetspel zette verraad je niet alleen waarvoor van gogh gestorvenis maar ook alles waarvoor hirsi ali staat dus isniet uitnodigen een politieke daad
7074397 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7074398 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7074399 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7074400 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7074401 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7074402 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7074403 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7074404 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7074405 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7074406 i work as the first point of contact for all the delegates all the vips
7074407 a lot of the preparation was working for the democratic party and working in different capacities in different campaigns
7074408 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7074409 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7074410 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7074411 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7074412 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7074413 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7074414 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7074415 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7074416 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7074417 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7074418 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7074419 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7074420 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7074421 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7074422 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7074423 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7074424 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7074425 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7074426 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7074427 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7074428 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7074429 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7074430 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7074431 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7074432 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7074433 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7074434 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7074435 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7074436 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7074437 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7074438 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7074439 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7074440 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7074441 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7074442 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7074443 you know there will be three days in the campaign where someone in chicago will get a call and respond what did you say he said
7074444 i think i have a much higher iq than you do
7074445 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7074446 its pretty secluded and can be secured more easily than some of the other parks in the area
7074447 im still going to vote for him but i thought he was about inclusion and thats not what this event is
7074448 when the president came we had motorcades come to the front and back entrances
7074449 we just do whatever they ask its an honor having them stay here
7074450 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7074451 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7074452 it was over for me before it ever really got started
7074453 the bottom line is that iowa is a grassroots state and its in the rural areas where the roots are deepest
7074454 its the question of what did you do in the war daddy
7074455 now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle
7074456 surprised the hell out my staff it surprised the hell out of me
7074457 how did we ever allow the republican right to take the high ground on values
7074458 we democrats arent fighting back we dont fight back on the values front i cant wait to debate rudy giuliani i mean come on man
7074459 i like what he has to say about values its about time we start fighting back
7074460 joe we have a problem down here theyre saying youre a catholic
7074461 kids keep a thought in their heads for 12 hours
7074462 its a beautiful life that takes work as a dad he rebuilt this family
7074463 i was a 42 year old guy who never really when i started off intended to really run quite frankly i thought more about how to win than how to govern i wasnt nearly as sure as what i wanted to do if i were able to govern today it is almost the opposite unfortunately
7074464 this time rightly or wrongly i am given a fair amount of credit by serious press guys for being ready to be president but theres grave doubt whether i can get the nomination to run for president so its kind of a flip do you know what i mean
7074465 its sort of been liberating i dont feel constrained in this campaign i dont parse my words i dont look at the polls im going to win or lose on my own terms one of the things that last time taught me was the worst way to lose was on somebody elses terms
7074466 they literally had to take the top of my head off twice
7074467 every time i hear i am more and more convinced hes the guy i want in the white house
7074468 theyve convinced themselves that you dont even know whats best for your own members theyve drugged the kool aid
7074469 there would be no middle class in american without the union movement
7074470 i dont expect government to solve my problems but i expect it to understand my problems
7074471 plagiarism give me a break i was chair of clinton gore in 92 and we were dealing with gennifer flowers
7074472 they stuck with me when i was being called a lying no good so and so how could i not and i really did not want to go back to sioux city
7074473 when you give up that principle youre just yielding to selfishness the people who got me through are the people who stayed loyal to me
7074474 is how do i survive this i think you are blinded by your despair its kind of like youre getting sucked inside yourself into a black hole except what you really need sometimes you just need to know someone else made it
7074475 i didnt know them i had never met them in my life
7074476 but you know when you have sort of a gift the gift is you survived you know if you give that to somebody it makes you feel worthwhile because people did it for me
7074477 ja het is waar d is dood het is bijna niet te bevatten
7074478 meneer blokker kunt u mij helpen helpt u mij dan toch
7074479 wat staat ons dus te doen allereerst kan ik alleen maar zeggen mijd die zaken en die plaatsen waar dit wordt aangeboden weerstaat de satan en hij zal van u vluchten leert de bijbel ons
7074480 de verbazing over de schepping en gods werken de boventoon voert
7074481 o lief oud moedertje wat heb je daar in je mandje
7074482 voor altijd zullen jullie in het gevaarlijke enge pangea land ver van de magische sprookjestuin zwerven voor eeuwig zullen jullie lijden en boeten
7074483 degenen die niet geloven in onze ayaat bewijzen ayaat lessen tekenen openbaringen enz zullen wij laten branden in het vuur zo vaak als hun huiden helemaal geroosterd zijn zullen wij hen door andere huiden vervangen zodat zij de straf zullen proeven zeker allah is al machtig al wijs
7074484 geselt iedere echtbreekster en echtbreker met honderd slagen en laat medelijden met hen u van de gehoorzaamheid aan allah niet afhouden indien gij in allah en de laatste dag gelooft en laat een groep gelovigen getuige zijn van hun bestraffing
7074485 als ik later groot ben wordt ik president van afghanistan
7074486 een islamitische man in itali protesteerde tegen een kruisbeeld in de klas van zijn kinderen hij won de rechtszaak het kruisbeeld moest uit het lokaal van de openbare school verwijderd worden
7074487 pas na drie keer lezen zie je dat dat niet zo is en dat het alleen maar veel feller lijkt dan wat er daadwerkelijk staat
7074488 mevrouw we waarderen ten zeerste het feit dat u de moeite heeft genomen om ons met uw inzichten betreffende islam en de moslims in het westen te delen er moet ons echter van het hart dat naar onze bescheiden mening uw opvattingen hieromtrent blijk geven van een eenzijdig benadering en onjuiste voorkennis 1 u vergeet negeert bijvoorbeeld de kruistochten 2 u verwijt de moslims in europe de oorlogen tussen de islamitische staat en de europese theologien 3 waarom is islam voor u blasfemie omdat het spreekt over profeten en karakters die ook in het nieuwe testament voor komen maar is het nieuwe testament voor u geen blasfemie terwijl hierin ook karakters voor komen uit het oude testament joden in de koran zegt allah tegen de mensen in mekkah die niet islam wilden adopteren de vertaling waarvan zoveel betekent als voor u uw geloof voor mij het mijne dat lijkt ons een mooie wijsheid om mee af te sluiten redactie expliciet
7074489 geliefden laten wij elkander liefhebben want de liefde is uit god en
7074490 moslimas denken vaak als ik geen hoofddoek draag haal ik mij het wantrouwen en de woede van mijn vader broers en andere familieleden op de hals doe ik wel een hoofddoek om dan laten ze me zonder al te veel controle studeren en werken maar deze redenering is slechts kortzichtig moslimas zijn na het afronden van hun studie immers nog lang niet van hun familie af integendeel en zo komen we op het dieperliggende probleem de vrouw als een ondergeschikt wezen dat slechts met listen wat vrije momenten steelt maar die nooit vrij zal zijn
7074491 het blijft dus evengoed een statement van die dames naar de westerse samenleving
7074492 er moet vind ik meer gescholden worden op de islam en meer gelachen om de islam we moeten die hoofddoekjes belachelijk maken ik ben het gegrom van die baarden zo ontzettend zat er moet meer worden gelachen
7074493 zakdoek mee und setzen wir uns wieder in tr nen niehiehieder
7074494 beste ayaan ik bewonder u ontzettend en ik ben trots op een vrouw zoals u ik ben zelf een marokkaanse vrouw en ik herken heel veel van wat u zegt
7074495 nog even een klein berichtje ik ben marokkaanse om precies te zijn berbers maar in amsterdam geboren ik ben zo een geval om het maar plat uit te drukken waar ayaan het over heeft ayaan zegt ook nadrukkerlijk ik heb het niet over alle moslims maar over gezinnen zoals bij mij thuis ik ben haar dankbaar dat ze durft iedereen is gelijk en zei durft dat te zeggen ook marokkaanse vrouwen mochen genieten en gaan en staan waar ze willen vriendelijke groet saida
7074496 de keus om de hoofddoek af te doen moet van moslims zelf komen anders is het een betekenisloos gebaar
7074497 ik ken massas moslimas die hun doek dragen simpelweg omdat ze vinden dat dat bij ze hoort zonder daar ooit over na te denken
7074498 de meeste moslimas leven gewoon hun leven zoals de meeste westerlingen dat doen
7074499 wellicht koesteren de meeste moslimas bij hun hoofddoek eerder een gevoel van nostalgisch verlangen naar hun jeugd dan naar de genade van allah
7074500 de moslimas zullen u dan toch nog steeds zien als vieze westerse hoeren omdat zij een hoofddoek willen dragen en u niet
7074501 nou ja we vragen wel of we even bij anja mogen schuilen
7074502 op welke verkiesbare plaats sta jij bij de pvda lagonda of toch liever psp anja zal je met open armen ontvangen
7074503 wat is het jammer dat theo er niet meer is
7074504 domme meiden die hersenloos met hun religie op het hoofd rondlopen
7074505 koran 5 51 o gij die geloofd neemt de joden en de christenen niet tot vrienden zij zijn elkanders vrienden en wie uwer hen tot vrienden neemt is inderdaad een hunner voorwaar allah leidt het overtredende volk niet
7074506 sorry manlief paplief broerlief neeflief het mag nou eenmaal niet in nederland basta en nu ga ik naar de kapper fietsen heerlijk de wind door mijn haar
7074507 die opmerking over theos begrip voor hoofddoeken vind ik buiten alle proporties en eigenlijk een beetje blasfemisch
7074508 op at5 zie ik de zegeningen van de multi culturele samenleving verbeeld bij monde van het nieuwbakken pvda raadslid fatima een juffrouw uit marokko die gehuld gaat in een hoofddoek ik heb wel ns gehoord dat hoofddoeken de onderworpenheid van de arabische vrouw symboliseren dat hoofddoeken een teken zijn van de duisterste middeleeuwen die ons wachten als de islam zou heersen op aard ik hou niet van hoofddoeken maar de eerlijkheid gebiedt me te zeggen dat toen ik vroeger van school werd gestuurd om bij de kapper mn haar te millimeteren alleen dan mocht ik blijven ik me danig in de zak gescheten voelde zoals ik vocht voor mn krullen heeft zij nu evenveel recht op haar hoofddoek t is niet anders
7074509 er zitten boefjes tussen maar de overgrote meerderheid van de lonsdalegabbertjes zijn hardwerkende betrokken burgers ze zijn alleen over 1 kam geschoren dat is alles
7074510 jullie zullen wel genieten van mijn volgende column bittertje heb ik straks in elk geval weer terug
7074511 beim ersten aufstieg des islams war der untergang der christlichen v lker nicht endg ltig aber sein wiederaufstieg in unserer zeit wird die vollst ndige verdr ngung der lehrs tze des heutigen christentums herbeif hren
7074512 de schrijfster zocht extreem orthodoxe moslimvrouwen verlichte islamfeministen brugfiguren tussen 2 culturen n op de vrouwen in dit boek hebben niets met elkaar gemeen behalve de controversi le hoofddoek sommigen vochten ertegen anderen ervoor
7074513 o jabir seek to have offspring seek to have offspring
7074514 this is the treasure that ye buried for yourselves taste ye then the treasures that ye buried
7074515 wat is het jammer dat theo er niet meer is
7074516 ik hou niet van hoofddoeken maar de eerlijkheid gebiedt me te zeggen dat toen ik vroeger van school werd gestuurd om bij de kapper mn haar te millimeteren alleen dan mocht ik blijven ik me danig in de zak gescheten voelde zoals ik vocht voor mn krullen heeft zij nu evenveel recht op haar hoofddoek t is niet anders
7074517 het hoofddoekje dragen is natuurlijk ieders vrije keus en in zekere zin dient t te worden toegejuicht dat de middeleeuwers die nederland zo haten van hun hart geen moordkuil maken en voor iedereen zichtbaar hun afkeer uitdragen van westerse aberraties als de gelijkwaardigheid van man en vrouw maar t heeft ook iets heel treurigs dat gebuig voor de geitenneukers die namens hun dochter willen uitmaken met wie ze trouwt wat ze denken mag en hoe ze er uit moet zien mag je mensen verbieden zich te onderwerpen nee dus ga uw gang zusters van horigheid
7074518 in frankrijk wordt gevochten over de kwestie of een hoofddoekje op een openbare school geaccepteerd mag worden ik heb geen antwoord op die nijpende kwestie hoewel de argumenten van de voorstanders van een verbod mij sympathiek voorkomen maar er is ook nog zoiets als persoonlijke vrijheid en wie ben ik om een dame te ontzeggen dat zij zich zou mogen tooien met de versierselen van haar onderdrukking
7074519 dat de islam de grootste vijand van het christendom is
7074520 geen enkele want ze zullen thuis nooit iets zeggen over hun ongeloof
7074521 o nee ik zou gedood kunnen worden misschien al hier en veel waarschijnlijker als ik terug ga naar waar ik vandaan kom
7074522 het gaat om simpele vragen waar kom ik vandaan waar ga ik naartoe en waarom ben ik hier
7074523 we zijn niet op aarde om te geloven maar om te leren
7074524 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

7074529 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7074530 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7074531 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7074532 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7074533 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7074534 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7074535 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7074536 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them

7074538 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7074539 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7074540 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7074541 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7074542 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7074543 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7074544 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7074545 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7074546 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7074547 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7074548 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7074549 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7074550 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7074551 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7074552 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7074553 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7074554 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7074555 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7074556 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
7074557 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
7074558 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
7074559 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
7074560 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
7074561 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7074562 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7074563 vroeger vertrok hier de trein naar auschwitz wanneer wordt de wereld wijzer
7074564 haha we gaan er een troep van maken stick it to the man
7074565 de jonge fortuynisten de zoveelste malloten die het gedachtegoed van wijlen pim f claimen zijn niet zo gecharmeerd van thomas en of zijn fotos en dus besloten drie jonge fortuynisten op een nacht in april waarschijnlijk niet eens aangetast door drank en andere verkwikkende middelen gewapend met een vlindermes verhaal te halen bij schlijper ze trokken eerst een sjaal voor hun hoofd en besloten toen thomas en al zijn buren wakker te bellen en zo kon het gebeuren dat er drie opgewonden mannetjes thomas beneden buurvrouw uit bed belden riepen dat ze voor thomas kwamen want hij moest ook maar ns op de foto de buurvrouw verzocht ze vriendelijk op een christelijk tijdstip terug te komen de heren taaiden af en namen maar een foto van de buurvrouw rare vogels de fortuynisten
7074566 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7074567 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7074568 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7074569 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7074570 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7074571 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7074572 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7074573 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7074574 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7074575 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7074576 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7074577 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7074578 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7074579 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7074580 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7074581 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7074582 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7074583 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7074584 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7074585 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7074586 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7074587 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7074588 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7074589 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7074590 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7074591 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7074592 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7074593 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7074594 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7074595 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7074596 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7074597 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7074598 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7074599 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7074600 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7074601 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7074602 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7074603 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7074604 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7074605 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7074606 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7074607 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7074608 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7074609 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7074610 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7074611 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7074612 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7074613 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7074614 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
7074615 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
7074616 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
7074617 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
7074618 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7074619 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7074620 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7074621 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7074622 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7074623 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7074624 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7074625 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7074626 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7074627 zij vertelden mij dat het super irritant is dat er altijd een politieke draai aan wordt gegeven als het om marokkanen gaat en dat mohammed b er altijd nodeloos bij wordt gehaald met dat in mijn achterhoofd ben ik eerst met spinvis gaan praten en heb hem vervolgens de opdracht gegeven
7074628 ga maar lekker buiten spelen wij verschaffen de speeltjes maar binnen doe je je hoofddoek af
7074629 uw gemotiveerde reactie intrigeert heer breedveld heb even op uw website geneusd maar u neemt het ook niet zo nauw met andersdenkenden u bent net zo laf als nassenstein als een kangeroe die bang is voor zakkenrollers
7074630 ik ben radicaal bang voor niemand bereid te vechten etc
7074631 met dezelfde taktieken als tijdens de koude oorlog proberen de overheid en allerlei geheime clubs ons ervan te doordringen dat we belaagd worden door alom tegenwoordige vijanden die van plan zijn onze samenleving voorgoed te ontwrichten
7074632 in zekere zin zou je opgelucht moeten zijn dat je het niet hebt gelezen
7074633 laat ik het zo zeggen welk boek raadt jij me aan te lezen om denemarken het beste te kunnen begrijpen de bijbel of hans christian andersen
7074634 de voormalige arabisch amerikaanse schrijver academicus edward said was tot voor kort n van de intellectuele zwaargewichten in de problematiek van het midden oosten en islam
7074635 god is voor ons een verzamelnaam voor het geloof in een opperwezen echter voorzichtigheid is geboden dat is de realiteit van ons huidige vaderland het is duidelijk dat god bestaat niet de denkbeeldige grens aangeeft van wat momenteel mogelijk is in ons land god neuken in de gedaante van een ezel zoals reve deed zou nu niet meer kunnen wij blijven ver binnen die denkbeeldige grens van toen wat aangeeft dat we op de weg terug zijn
7074636 juist in tijden van grote crisis moet een samenleving de grootst mogelijke openheid betrachten alles moet op tafel komen alles moet besproken worden dat is de enige weg naar een oplossing
7074637 als god zich opnieuw in de levende stof gevangen geeft zal hij als ezel terugkeren hoogstens in staat een paar lettergrepen te formuleren miskend en verguisd en geranseld maar ik zal hem begrijpen en meteen met hem naar bed gaan maar ik doe zwachtels om zijn hoefjes dat ik niet te veel schrammen krijg als hij spartelt bij het klaarkomen
7074638 en god zelf zou bij mij langs komen in de gedaante van een njarige muisgrijze ezel en voor de deur staan en aanbellen en zeggen
7074639 mijn heer en mijn god geloofd weze uw naam tot in alle eeuwigheid ik houd zo verschrikkelijk veel van u
7074640 u kent ze stellig wel die nimmer aflaten te berichten hoe groots en verlossend toch wel hun buitengewoon juiste geloof is hoe uitzonderlijk goed hun god die hen dagelijks in alles gratis van advies dient het nu juist met h n meent die precies weten wie gered wordt en wie niet en die mij opbellen om mij te melden dat ik mits ik mijn beestachtige zondigheid zou kunnen loslaten de heerlijkheid deelachtig kan worden die de hunne is omdat zij de zoon hebben het laatste woord is tekenend en die mij bij voorbeeld een evangelisatieblaadje toesturen met een pijl naar de naar buiten gevouwen kop van een artikel dat getiteld is gangster werd getuige van christus
7074641 ik bezit geen statisch godsbeeld maar als ik van god een definitie zou moeten geven dan zou die thans luiden god is het diepst verborgene meest weerloze allerwezenlijkste en onvergankelijkste in onszelf
7074642 in de eerste plaats het recht om er een godsdienst op na te houden en die openlijk en ongehinderd te belijden ten tweede het recht er g n godsdienst op na te houden een recht waaraan in ons land nog wel het een en ander mankeert ik noem alleen maar de nog maar zeer ten dele ge indigde achterstelling van bij voorbeeld de humanisten bij de subsidi ring van zielszorg en andere sociale arbeid en ten derde het recht om het geloof in het algemeen of enige godsdienstige idee in het bijzonder welke dan ook te bestrijden en te bespotten het is niet de taak van een moderne pluralistische democratische rechtsstaat de aanhangers ener godsdienstige overtuiging een speciale bescherming te verstrekken die hij de aanhangers van bij voorbeeld een politieke overtuiging onthoudt om het kort en krachtig te zeggen deze wet verleent de godsdienstige burger een volstrekt ongrondwettelijke bevoorrechting
7074643 die in strijd is met de beginselen ener moderne rechtsstaat en die koren op de molen is van de vijanden der vrijheid hoort maar op een plek thuis in de prullenmand
7074644 ten eerste weiger ik en zal ik altijd blijven weigeren mijn teksten aan te passen aan het begripsvermogen van de slechte verstaanders dat is geen kwestie van beginsel maar van vakmanschap ik stel mij ten doel voldragen literair werk te leveren en geen produkt van het
7074645 zonder vrijheid van meningsuiting zijn er geen andere vrijheden meer
7074646 dat mensen goden en profeten willen aanbidden al dan niet met gebruik van afgodsbeelden is hun zaak maar anderen moeten de volle vrijheid hebben om daar smalende en lasterlijke opmerkingen over te maken natuurlijk is het onaardig om voortdurend gelovigen te pesten en het is redelijk om iemands lichtgeraaktheid te ontzien of het nu zijn gedichten zijn moeder zijn god zijn inkomen of zijn oorlogsverleden betreft maar je mening moet je kunnen zeggen ook op smalende toon lichtgeraaktheid of niet het zou een goede zaak zijn als d66 in samenwerking met vvd en partij van de arbeid een wetsvoorstel zou indienen waarbij de artikelen 147 en 147a van ons wetboek van strafrecht zouden komen te vervallen dan zou ons vaderland minder op iran lijken
7074647 ongelofelijk dat was w r een rondje van 35 3
7074648 ik geloof in een genadige god maar stel je voor dat ik me vergis en dat ik na mijn dood zon keiharde urker ontdek een oog om oog tand om tand gelovige of een allah mijn hemel wat krijgen we dan
7074649 als ik een premier zou moeten kiezen uit het cda zou het donner zijn een echte gereformeerde aan wie je het tobben en knarsen afziet
7074650 processen wegens godslastering wat belachelijk en ouderwets kort geleden gebeurde dat ook nog hier
7074651 fanatieke gelovigen zijn niet in staat hun eigen geloof te relativeren zij kunnen zich gewoon niet voorstellen dat hetgeen zij van de kansel verkondigen voor sommigen net zo godslasterlijk kan zijn
7074652 zonder vrijheid van denken zijn er geen andere vrijheden meer
7074653 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
7074654 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7074655 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7074656 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7074657 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7074658 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7074659 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7074660 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7074661 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7074662 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7074663 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7074664 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7074665 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7074666 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7074667 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7074668 sicili was wel bloedheet en ondanks de autotrein naar bologna nog een flink eind rijden het is een clich maar we zijn ook bestolen een brommertje rukte de tas met portemonnee uit mijn handen en het viel niet mee dat aan de plaatselijke politie uit te leggen aangezien wij geen italiaans spreken en zij geen engels een hele bijzondere ervaring was dat en die hadden we niet willen missen kostte ons een halve dag de campings waren propvol en onze oordopjes hielpen niet tegen al dat discogeweld elke avond maar ik zal deze vakantie niet snel vergeten

7074670 een middenweg nu je het zegt de middenweg die ligt in de watergraafsmeer tussen amsterdam en diemen zou karel van het reve zeggen
7074671 en die middenweg grenst geloof ik weer aan de plek waar theo van gogh uit naam van ons nieuwe geloof is afgeslacht dus die moeten ze toch kennen die middenweg zal mij benieuwen of daar nog een passend herdenkingsteken komt eens zien tot welk inzicht de gemeente amsterdam komt tot nu toe lijkt het er meer op dat ze het in hun pvda broekjes doen voor de mogelijke gevolgen voor het krenken van de eer van andere culturen ze laten zich gemakkelijk intimideren door echt mannelijk gedrag dat kennen ze zelf niet zo maar die intimidatie tolereren ze want eigenlijk kijken ze neer op die anderen het toch te tolereren geeft ze een goed gevoel h het is pure zelfbevrediging
7074672 kijk nou eens sandra moet je die daar nou zien lopen we zitten hier in een gooise volksbuurt wel veilig op zandgrond hoog en droog maar een woestijn en kamelen zie ik hier niet jij
7074673 houd op over die lappen ik ben er net een beetje van af sinds de vakantie dat die vrouwen daar in trappen is een ontkenning van de emancipatie van de vrouw die baardmannen zwetsen wat over de eer van de vrouw maar het is natuurlijk gewoon vrouwenonderdrukking een kind kan het zien als mijn dochtertje er straks ook maar niet n wil godnogantoe toch moet je je ervoor afsluiten want de waanzin zal de komende jaren niet stoppen er zullen steeds meer contracten met die fundamentalisten worden afgesloten let maar op weet je waar ik eigenlijk op zit te wachten dat die smerige hondenpoep op straat eindelijk eens verleden tijd gaat worden dat moeten die extreme baardmannen toch wel voor elkaar kunnen krijgen niemand is het gelukt maar als iemand de hondenuitlaters op hun gedrag kan wijzen dan zijn het de moslims wel
7074674 nu je het toch over problemen hebt sandra wist je al dat die vogelgriep hier binnenkort ook wordt verwacht en dat die kan overslaan op mensen dodelijk net zo dodelijk als een terroristische aanslag en het duurt drie maanden voordat ze een anti virus hebben ontwikkeld je moet me niet uitlachen hoor maar ik heb gisteren eens flink voedsel ingeslagen voedsel dat ik anders nooit zou kopen blikken bruine bonen spaghetti groenteblikjes die ik in mijn studententijd wel at en water heel veel water maar de houdbaarheidsdatum h de houdbaarheidsdatum dat is het probleem

7074677 de staat moet namelijk geloofwaardig zijn als arbiter die boven de partijen staat de neutrale staat is daarom een noodzakelijk complement op de multiculturele samenleving
7074678 ik sta zelf niet voor de keuze of ik al dan niet zon ding zou moeten dragen en ik ken ook niet iemand in mijn omgeving die met het probleem worstelt ik zie dus niet helemaal in waarom ik er een mening over zou moeten vormen ik heb ook niet zulke uitgesproken meningen ovr tatoeages of het verven van haar of het dragen van sandalen of wat dan ook kortom het is geen vraagstuk dat mij aangaat
7074679 effe vragen annelies heb het nog niet gelezen stond dit nu in nrchandelsblad van gisteren waarvan ik me niet kan voorstellen da het gehonoreer is of is dit naar jouw weblog gestuurd

7074681 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7074682 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7074683 the disgusting manner on which the anti smoke mafia provably consists of about 5 percent of the population actually firmer than ever tries to kick in someones bas books the sixty percent principally satisfied smokers minority oppresses majority isnt that called terrorism
7074684 i suspect that ms gans gets wet dreams about being fucked by dr mengele
7074685 because then ms gans will have to explain in court that she claims that she does not get wet dreams about dr mengele
7074686 anja meulenbelt quotes theo van gogh as saying that feminists should stop campaigning against husbands violence in marriages gentlemen who give a tough hiding are quite attractive to some ladies really that remark was on women in general not especially on muslim women the theme of alis and van goghss film was islamic wives beaten by their husbands which was said to be inspired by the koran muslim women who had suffered domestic violence reacted very angrily to the film when it was shown on dutch tv i was beaten by that no good husband not by the koran one objected making this a koran issue will just give them an excuse the film was sort of soft porn david hamilton emmanuelle style featuring a naked woman with a christian moluccan actress playing an islamic woman in see through clothes with verses from the koran written on them the women who objected to the film said this cheapened and sensationalised their extremely real issues with their husbands
7074687 dutch poet remco campert wrote de mortuis nil sini bene speak only good of the dead that is a maxim which van gogh violated consistently i think i would insult him if now i would say nice sugary things about him
7074688 one could even say that these are really words of a true bastard

7074690 in muntz en van de wint het grote complot de wereld verklaard gaan de moraalridders muntz en van de wint op zoek naar de alomvattende verklaring van de wereld waarin we leven
7074691 dat ik het in nederland niet meer kon uithouden na de verzetstijd en de bevrijding met de vertrapping van het voormalige verzet en diens inpalming door oranjefascisten met prins bernhard als beschermheer en na mijn dienst als oorlogsvrijwilliger in prins bernhards elitekorps stoottroepen waarmee ik mijn leven waagde voor wat ik dacht de goede zaak te zijn de uitzending heb ik niet gezien maar vrienden houden mij op de hoogte geen enkele van de nederlandse media in kranten com schreef er iets over ik wacht even het eind van die serie af uiteraard kan er niets werkelijk ernstigs uit de bus komen want de hele mediatroep ligt in handen van en wordt gecontroleerd door de oranjefascistische maffia en dat maakt deel uit van het grote complot dus
7074692 z k h prins bernhard contacted our south east division and asked us casually about our plans he was one of us so we told him however when the operation was underway i shouted they knew we were coming at once a smelt a mickey
7074693 waarom haal jij in je bolle hoofd om theos naam te bezoedelen zonder inhoud zonder argumentatie
7074694 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7074695 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7074696 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7074697 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
7074698 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
7074699 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
7074700 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
7074701 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7074702 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7074703 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7074704 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7074705 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7074706 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7074707 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7074708 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7074709 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7074710 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7074711 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7074712 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7074713 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7074714 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7074715 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7074716 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7074722 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7074723 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7074724 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us

7074731 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7074732 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7074733 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7074734 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7074735 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7074736 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7074737 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7074738 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
7074739 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
7074740 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
7074741 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
7074742 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured

7074748 ik ben er echter volledig van overtuigd dat het verwrongen beeld van vrouwen mede oorzaak is van al het geweld in of vanuit islamitische hoek de hierarchie bepalen je positie bevechten etc en dat het daarmee ten diepste een seksuele basis heeft dit te zeggen is nog steeds een groot taboe

7074751 tijdens de uitreiking van de hariet frezer ring of hoe dat ding ook heet presenteerde zich een moslima die maandenlang bij hirsi ali heeft ondergedoken gezeten iedereen vraagt zich altijd af waar dan die moslimas zijn voor wie hirsi ali het zegt op te nemen zei ze welnu ik ben er n van veel ruchtbaarheid is hier verder natuurlijk niet aan gegeven door de pers
7074752 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7074753 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me
7074754 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7074755 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7074756 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7074757 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7074758 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7074759 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7074760 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7074761 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7074762 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7074763 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7074764 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7074765 the iraq war was driven by oil and testosterone the other fossil fuel its time america learned that acting like a man means acting like an adult
7074766 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
7074767 its to say to the whole country we are here
7074768 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
7074769 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
7074770 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
7074771 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
7074772 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
7074773 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
7074774 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
7074775 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
7074776 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
7074777 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
7074778 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
7074779 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
7074780 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
7074781 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
7074782 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
7074783 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
7074784 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
7074785 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
7074786 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
7074787 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
7074788 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
7074789 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
7074790 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
7074791 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
7074792 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
7074793 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
7074794 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
7074795 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
7074796 our board of trustees understands the economic challenges people face and concluded that offering a free admission option for children would stimulate additional attendance and might enable a broader audience to experience the treasures currently housed at the museum it serves as a gift to the community not unlike the u s navy band sea chanters concert and the community day and ice cream social events which the museum delivered free to the community in the spring
7074797 usually when young people are exposed to issues especially through the eyes of their peers they sense injustice and they want to know what they can do to fix it
7074798 i thought it was going to be something cool to go to that they were not going to send me some place bad
7074799 were never going to eat all of that in two hours we might as well just face it
7074800 an elephant wouldnt be able to eat that in two hours

7074830 in april brennan underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip an injury he played with in the senior bowl and at the nfl draft combine where he was the only quarterback to complete all 22 of his attempts to receivers running different routes
7074831 they said i was too small a gunslinger a street ball quarterback who only knew how to play in certain systems i was beat up so much in that draft i was belittled berated they said it was the system that i played in the wac this isnt a dis on joe flacco baltimores first round quarterback choice but he went to a d ii school played weaker competition didnt have as successful a year as i did yet he still went in the first round because hes 6 5 and can throw the ball 70 yards you always used to hear bill walsh say accuracy and toughness are what makes a quarterback great and thats like what i am accurate and tough to see me fall to see so many people say hell never make it in the nfl hes a worthless pick i couldnt believe it
7074832 thats all right if you think it was hard to come back from being falsely accused of sexual assault going through a trial and all that its real easy to come back from being criticized for not being a good football player
7074833 december 14 probation was up i look back and know what i did and what i didnt do and i realize i cant ever put myself in a situation like that again but i also do the reverse on it too i dont look at it like thats always going to be brought up i look at it as im a convicted felon thats how dangerous our society can be and how far i had to go to get here i need to grow from that the sensitivity of the issue to make sure that doesnt happen to another kid in a similar situation
7074834 ever since that happened in colorado every dream ive ever had as a little kid is starting to come true i was fourth string walk on qb two years later i was a heisman trophy candidate and now im on an nfl field i got a lot of faith a lot of faith
7074835 i just had a child with one woman and im already looking for someone else to get pregnant but not marry

7074841 i was at the dinner i called and told you
7074842 well at least they didnt rape her for a minute it looked like they might rape her and i was afraid i wouldnt be able to watch it
7074843 if they have to beat her up its okay just dont rape her
7074844 its the ultimate form of humiliation and loss of power
7074845 taken at will used bought sold and controlled its simultaneously something to be ashamed of and something to be flaunted
7074846 with his selection of joe biden senator obama has made crystal clear his commitment to raising taxes the obama biden ticket has a long history of voting for and advocating tax increases on those making as little as 42 000 a year new jerseyans already pay more in state and local taxes than anyone else in the nation senators obama and biden want to make sure that we also pay more in federal taxes too that idea will be about as popular as corzines toll hike plan and makes john mccains no tax increase platform all that more attractive this sets up a major contrast that we will drive home from now until election day if voters want a president who will raise their taxes vote for obama if you want a president who wont support mccain barack obama has chosen a 35 year washington insider as a running mate biden completely undermines obamas central themes biden made it clear time and time again that he doesnt think senator obama has the skills experience or judgement to be president these guys are going to be answering questions about bidens criticism of obamas plan to legislate failure and cut off funding and support for our troops in iraq and afghanistan from now until election day

7074854 indiana thinks that in person verification with photo id helps to reduce cheating on legal rules for both buying wine and voting and perhaps other subjects
7074855 it would be awfully hard to take judicial notice that in person verification with photo id has no effect on wine fraud and therefore flunks the interstate commerce clause

7074864 you know what you need to shut your brain off for a few and just go with the flow
7074865 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7074866 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7074867 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7074868 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7074869 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7074870 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7074871 idealization and myth making about a polygamist alcoholic and absentee marxist father
7074872 youve always been the cute quiet shy serious one you came out of my stomach that way you never caused trouble and never liked having all the attention on you i think thats just how god intended you to be

7074880 its a living highway for those who live and those who have died everyone who has served with the 173rd airborne brigade this is for the guys and gals yesterday today and tomorrow
7074881 it was neat that our state legislators in a time when theres been a little bit of divisiveness were able to work together and pass this joint resolution unanimously
7074882 when bob getz brought this to me and told me the history of the 173rd airborne brigade i thought this was a great way to honor those who had served on our behalf and i was happy to support the initiative
7074883 i think we owe them a great debt of gratitude and this is a small honor we can give them
7074884 i dont know how many members of the 173rd airborne brigade will be in the area but we said if you are anywhere between chicago and rockford madison and milwaukee come and join us

7074895 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7074896 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7074897 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7074898 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7074899 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7074900 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7074901 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7074902 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7074903 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7074904 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7074905 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7074906 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7074907 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7074908 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7074909 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7074910 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7074911 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7074912 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7074913 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7074914 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7074915 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7074916 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7074917 if there is something that i cannot do dont blame it on age

7074925 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7074926 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7074927 the selection of senator joe biden as running mate to senator barack obama was a prudent and praise worthy decision mr bidens experience candor and ability to reach out to people even those with whom he may disagree is well established there will be those that will raise his remarks early in the campaign season about senator obama being the first african american with certain qualities to seek the nomination as the last african american democratic candidate for president i can assure you this will be a non issue senator biden upon making those comments called me to give clarity and went that day on my syndicated radio show to explain his remarks to voters all over the country and took calls we should not allow this to waste one minute of consideration as we move toward november senator bidens record in civil rights is exemplary

7074962 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7074963 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7074964 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7074965 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7074966 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7074967 while barack obama and the democrats continue to shift economic positions and pass the largest tax increases in american history john mccain has consistently fought against washingtons pork barrel spending and proposed a real plan to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses
7074968 with fan and fred on the brink of a treasury bailout crucial support to the mortgage market will be sorely tested
7074969 the ensnared banks in turn are asking larger players in the market to redeem their long term borrowings which could trigger further sales of asset backed securities this means credit is about to get even costlier and tighter
7074970 healing in the housing market might still be a few quarters away time that fannie and freddie and possibly several others in the financial industry probably dont have
7074971 happy to announce that zardari had accepted his partys nomination
7074972 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7074973 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7074974 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7074975 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7074976 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7074977 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7074978 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7074979 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7074980 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7074981 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7074982 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7074983 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7074984 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7074985 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7074986 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7074987 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7074988 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7074989 happy to announce that zardari had accepted his partys nomination

7075000 it shows aromas of raspberries wood strawberry blueberry red currant the structure of the wine is elegant with lovely complexity of red fruit and earthy elements great balance in the finish with beautiful essence of terroir from priorat

7075004 how can you be a leader of anything if you cant be a leader of your home
7075005 i walk the streets and people say please run as a write in
7075006 ive never known anything like this to happen before in my 50 years as a warden
7075007 obviously it must have been distressing for the family and friends to have to go through it all again the next day always assuming they managed to take another day off work
7075008 following the loss of a loved one an emotionally difficult time my family turned to the co op to provide the funeral services
7075009 on the day of the funeral the family arrived at the church early on what we knew would be an emotionally difficult day
7075010 only the immediate members of the family were able to attend the interment on the following day this has caused anxiety emotional distress disappointment and embarrassment to the family
7075011 after difficult discussions with the branch manager and regional manager last week a conclusion has been reached it is not a satisfactory conclusion but we needed closure so the family can finally grieve
7075012 we are currently reviewing the circumstances of what happened and will ensure necessary lessons are learnt to prevent such an unfortunate situation occurring in the future
7075013 we recognise that mrs howells funeral did not meet our usual high standards
7075014 do i have to change my name will it get me far
7075015 we zijn gisteren al gegaan en logeren bij familie om de drukte op de weg van de zaterdag een beetje te ontlopen we waren vandaag rond een uur of elf op de haven en zitten ongeveer vanaf 13 00 op de dijk ik had eigenlijk wel verwacht dat het drukker zou zijn we konden de auto gewoon achter de dijk parkeren
7075016 we hebben hier met tweedehands autos gestaan en er toch vier verkocht het liefst had ik al mn autos hier neergezet maar dat kon niet
7075017 william dembski of the southern baptist theological seminary another well known intelligent design proponent has stated
7075018 lets present their students with both sides of this fascinating scientific debate
7075019 proponents of intelligent design are not trying to teach religion via science but are trying to establish the validity of their theory as a scientific alternative to darwinism
7075020 both sides ought to be properly taught so people can understand what the debate is about
7075021 the claim that specified complexity cannot arise through random mutation and selection is a specious argument
7075022 look at that thing it is just too cool not to have been actively designed
7075023 is the evidence for design in biological systems so obvious
7075024 features that strike us as odd in a design might have been placed there by the designer for reason for artistic reasons for variety to show off for some as yet undetectable practical purpose or for some unguessable reason or they might not
7075025 are these historians telling students what happened in the past or are they just using their interpretation of history to argue for a philosophical position they hold in the present
7075026 during the second century ad greco roman civilization lost its creative energies and the values of classical humanism were challenged by mythic religious movements no longer regarding reason as a satisfying guide to life the educated elite subordinated the intellect to feelings and an unregulated imagination the application of reason to nature and society as we have seen was the great achievement of the greek mind but despite its many triumphs greek rationalism never entirely subdued the mythic religious mentality which draws its strength from human emotion the masses of peasants and slaves remained attracted to religious forms ritual mystery magic and ecstasy never lost their hold on the ancient world nor indeed have they in our own technological and scientific society during the hellenistic age the tide of rationalism gradually receded and the non rational an ever present undercurrent showed renewed vigor seeing themselves as isolated souls wandering aimlessly in a social desert people sought refuge in religion reason had been found wanting the time for faith and salvation was at hand a spiritual malaise had descended upon the greco roman world among the upper classes the philosophic and scientific spirit withered rational and secular values were in retreat stressing the intellect and self reliance greco roman thought did not provide for the emotional needs of people christianity addressed itself to this defect in the greco roman outlook the triumph of christianity was related to a corresponding decline in the vitality of hellenism and a shift in cultural emphasis a movement from reason to emotion and revelation offering comfortable solutions to the existential problems of life and death religion demonstrated a greater capability to stir human hearts than reason did hellenism had invented the tools of rational thought but the power of mythical thought was never entirely subdued by the late roman empire science and philosophy were unable to compete with mysticism and myth christian truth ultimately rested on faith not reason
7075027 created equally and are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
7075028 in a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ an demand the function we make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise we laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst we castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful
7075029 i have seen otley change tremendously over the years yet the one thing that has remained constant is that the college has always provided the local community with an array of different learning opportunities
7075030 i think that as a teacher you have to have enthusiasm for the subject you teach and be willing to pick up new skills along the way
7075031 i am delighted to have reached the landmark of being one of otleys longest serving part time lecturers and hope to be associated with the college for many more years to come
7075032 we are grateful to adam for all his hard work his experience and wisdom have been a valuable asset to the college and his knowledge of the subjects he teaches is second to none
7075033 my brother and i we quit our jobs a couple weeks ago
7075034 now were training full time im anxious to get in there its tough going into it the first couple fights before you have a little padding in the wallet
7075035 i wasnt too happy with what was going on with the ifl at the moment
7075036 i really didnt get treated that well personally so i was pretty happy when we got out of the ifl contract
7075037 we were actually supposed to be out of it when i got called for the marcus aurelio fight in the ufc then the ifl kind of hosed me
7075038 to win the title and not get to defend it thats what makes a champion being able to defend the title that is frustrating not being able to defend my belt
7075039 he was asking them what was going on when we were getting out all that stuff then it all happened so quickly it was like one day it was like oh youre released from the ifl a day later the ufcs calling up it was pretty crazy
7075040 we push each other really hard if its rolling or just doing striking and conditioning
7075041 we really push each other no one can push you like family you can get under each others skin but it never gets into anything bigger
7075042 i think training with a brother is a huge advantage
7075043 dan and i are really competitive but weve never gotten into fights or anything like that we joke around with each other were competitive with each other we push each other he likes to tap me out i like to tap him out but its more just like rubbing it in the other guys face
7075044 on nights when weve fought on the same card it can get a little hairy
7075045 weve been lucky that most of the time nothings really happened the last two fights that we fought on the same card were a little tough
7075046 the one we fought in november at ring of combat it was the third round and dan was fighting before me
7075047 so then the doctors are like oh you broke a bone youve got to go to the hospital then ive got to sit there and see my older brother put on a gurney so hes going to the emergency room 45 minutes before im supposed to step in the ring hes been there every day with me training hes been in my corner for every other fight and then to have to wish him luck as he goes to the hospital was tough it was really difficult to keep my head in the game
7075048 i go hard for all three rounds when you see me fight the fight is going to end up on the ground and its going to be a war on the ground
7075049 im not the best jiu jitsu guy im not the best striker but my style is just to keep advancing get my opponent into a scramble and take something
7075050 and im really not going to leave anything for the after party there are guys out there that like to pace it out so they feel the same in the third round as they did the first round that just doesnt sit well with me im going to go out and im going to push as hard as i can
7075051 if it comes down to me now being able to stand up after the third round then ive got three cornermen in my corner to carry me out
7075052 hes been a very well respected officer in our department and in the community

7075096 the highlands has engaged in proceeding through this process weve done all thats been asked of us yet were right back to something that was first proposed to this board and was defeated many months ago
7075097 i think its a far far better process than having some sort of arbitrator dictate some outcome which may be less satisfactory to this board or some of its members or less satisfactory to the highlands
7075098 i just cant imagine that when this board first looked at the notion of a regional growth strategy we ever expected to be in a position where this board could sit around and veto the decisions of one of the members here

7075109 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7075110 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7075111 the childrens centre for mentally or physically challenged children has been refurbished and now has a rain water catchment system and solar panels
7075112 everything doesnt go as planned all the time if it did it would be a perfect world
7075113 its the preseason and thats what its for to get better and get ready for the season we all have confidence in each other that well get it done a team like green bay with the three step drops theyre getting rid of the ball quick its hard to get pressure when its three steps and out
7075114 its not the pepsi center anymore it looks presidential with all the stars and colors
7075115 william engdahl missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war global research august 15 2008
7075116 caucasus frontier 2008 involved units of the 58th army and the 4th air force army stationed in the north caucasus military district
7075117 an escalation in tension in the georgian abkhaz and georgian ossetian conflict zones and that russias north caucasian military district was ready to provide assistance to russian peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia if needed
7075118 the development of strong political economic and security ties among countries of the south caucasus and central asia and the west which will foster stability in this region which is vulnerable to political and economic pressures from the south north and east
7075119 the region of the south caucasus and central asia could produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the dependence of the united states on energy from the volatile persian gulf region
7075120 in the caspian black sea region the european union and the united states have concentrated on setting up a reliable logistics chain to connect central asia with the european union via the central caucasus and turkey ukraine
7075121 the new transit route is part of a larger project to build two parallel pipelines connecting china with central asias vast natural gas reserves
7075122 has signed deals with state oil and gas firms of turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan giving them 50 percent stakes in their respective parts of the pipeline
7075123 illuminating the sea the marine paintings of james e buttersworth 1844 1894
7075124 it was pretty involved and a lot more than just a cameras in cameras out sort of thing
7075125 thats hitting the nail on the head because one of the things that most impresses me about this job is that im never bored i mean im constantly seeing one of a kind pieces of art the fragile nature of these items never gets old whether were seeing a painting or sculpture or a piece of furniture
7075126 its a pleasure to see such a variety of excellence in one show theres a lot of breadth here and you can see from the earlier to later works or the storm or sailing pieces the variety of technique and imagination he had
7075127 i have a nice library but a painting like this one where historical context is so important means i have to do a fair amount of work and the seaport people to that end were a great help
7075128 and this place has all that in abundance the only thing wrong is that i cant put a line in the water and do some fishing but the seaport is very impressive
7075129 a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama win the presidency and govern
7075130 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7075131 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7075132 particularly on national security and foreign policy issues this stuff is second nature to joe
7075133 theres no research necessary hell have an informed opinion on everything that comes up i think hed be a good mentor and collaborator for barack
7075134 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
7075135 he fought back beyond respectability and the fact that hes here today in this position is testament to his mettle
7075136 his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7075137 the real price of a gold medal would be three four or five times higher up to 100 million dr connor from the australian defence force academy said

7075145 i told her that maybe she can get excited in the backyard but she cant go to hannaford and sing i know something you dont know
7075146 my first reaction was of total excitement but i knew i couldnt do anything about it
7075147 my opinion might i think obama made a great choice
7075148 some of these independent voters who like joe will look at the pick and say obama made an interesting choice
7075149 i think it will also help unite the party i think a lot of clinton supporters liked joe and this will help the ticket

7075151 ich habe alles gegeben und das maximum aus dem auto herausgeholt
7075152 das zeigt wie eng alles zusammen liegt mehr w re aber wohl nicht drin gewesen
7075153 wir liegen nur 1 3 sekunden hinter der bestzeit und konnten sogar ein werksauto hinter uns lassen
7075154 es ist das erste rennen mit dem getriebe und wir haben damit eindeutig einen fortschritt gemacht
7075155 wir haben die meiste zeit das wochenende den speed nicht gefunden es ist hier eine neue strecke was die positionen etwas durcheinander wirbelt aber wir scheinen nicht die pace von vor ein paar rennen zu haben was recht frustrierend ist es gab ein paar runden mit denen ich zufrieden war aber wir haben es nicht in q3 geschafft
7075156 auf meinem letzten run bin ich in kurve f nf nach au en gekommen und habe rund vier zehntel verloren obwohl ich noch zwei zehntel zur ckgeholt habe bedeutete der verlust auf der ganzen runde dass ich es nicht schaffte so laufen diese qualifyings eben

7075159 the music is too loud and its running too late i want it shut down
7075160 maam our dance is scheduled until 5 00am and we are not disturbing any other events
7075161 well there are kids are in there and if this thing is for kids then there should not be a dance
7075162 yes this convention is an all ages event but the dance is one of our most popular events and we have no intention of shutting it down

7075164 i want you to shut the dance down there are kids here and they should not be in a dance at this time of night and this man is not helping make him shut the dance down
7075165 the dance is one of our biggest events closing it down would disappoint thousands of our attendees who look forward to it each year
7075166 this is not fair i want the d dance shut down and i want it shut down now
7075167 maam raising your voice will not help your case please calm down
7075168 my daughter sneaked out of our hotel room and i know shes in the dance i went in there and i couldnt find her
7075169 is that all so you wanted us to shut the entire dance down just to get your daughter out
7075170 go to the search engines and type in cad services

7075180 his economic plan is four more years of george bush s economic plan
7075181 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a
7075182 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7075183 everything from gas to groceries health care to has gone up
7075184 while barack obama and the democrats continue to shift economic positions and pass the largest tax increases in american history
7075185 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7075186 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7075187 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7075188 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7075189 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7075190 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7075191 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7075192 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7075193 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7075194 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7075195 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7075196 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7075197 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7075198 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7075199 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7075200 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7075201 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7075204 i was making the point that up until now in my state weve had a strong indian community made up of leading scientists and researchers and engineers
7075205 were having middle class people move to delaware take over dunkin donuts take over businesses just like other immigrant groups have and i was saying that theyre growing its moving
7075206 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy

7075209 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth

7075213 everybody s watching what s going on in beijing right now with the olympics
7075214 ignores how those structures were assembled the source and conditions of the labor the lack of pollution controls in beijing and throughout china the many complaints that chinese infrastructure outside the olympics zone remains shoddy the recent record of chinese manufacturing scandals including the heparin fiasco which killed many americans and of course the catastrophe brought about by chinese building standards in the region rocked by the recent earthquake

7075220 i wonder why there was such a small audience for these two excellent artists could it be the weak
7075221 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink
7075222 if this upsets you remember it is pure fiction if it doesnt then its not

7075225 i barack obama have sewn this campaign up since it is already won i do not need a vp candidate who can supplement the ticket but merely one who wont screw things up
7075226 there is a difference between the two parties however the democrats can usually depend on the mainstream media accepting their narratives uncritically while the republicans can expect them to punch holes in their storylines
7075227 an interesting question is whether mainstream media have any appetite for undermining this undeniably attractive narrative
7075228 obama backers dismiss attempts to undermine his narrative as distractions or as racism beyond the bounds of reasonable discourse most of the mainstream media tend to agree

7075231 a lot of people have now started investing in art and subsequently evading tax by under valuing their purchase
7075232 a lot of imported art work was even not listed in the brought in items by some art galleries a few years ago
7075233 respective art galleries and art houses are responsible for maintaining the record of their businesses and the finance of art work we dont directly indulge in any transactions whatsoever
7075234 in the case of transactions happening through a credit or debit card we get to know the details of the buyer through the pan card or other documents but cash transactions do not leave a trail
7075235 we send a team of experts and our officials at such places to keep ourselves acquainted

7075263 thats the first and most important step to setting up a budget
7075264 what i would suggest for parents to do is to give them a salary
7075265 most importantly in going along with a budget and this is where students blow it is that they should leave room for fun
7075266 there should be budget allotments for fun whether thats going out to more expensive places or vacation money or spending it going bowling
7075267 its sort of like social networking for managing your money

7075269 the pregnant body the social body and the burden of certain types of babies are all culturally loaded in ways that reflect the vast movement in the past century in the united states to popularize eugenics the quest to craft a more perfect union through fewer and better babies is alive and well many eugenic ideas have jumped the gap from yesterday to today bridging the chasm between overtly coercive eugenics and purportedly voluntary parental and social responsibility in the land of the free and among people supposedly freed for discipleship the era on which we will concentrate often called the progressive era saw the professonialization of marriage domesticity hygiene and charity as with the rising interest in infant feeding and child nutrition there were unquestionable gains in the care of children and family made by those newly charged and ready to organize the race for the future schools were built children were clothed and hungry mouths were fed but along with the efforts came a newly potent death dealing distinction between those whose lives were and those whose lives were not many of the participants in the progressive class of protestants drew a line between lineages of hope and lineages of risk peril and civic menace the distinction between auspicious and inauspicious lives was an integral part of the engine of mainline protestant eugenics

7075279 je kan echt geen goud verwachten in een wedstrijd met blanka vlasic erbij toen het zeker was dat we een medaille hadden ben ik rechtgesprongen en heb ik geroepen in de eretribune iedereen keek naar mij en ik heb me eigenlijk wat gegeneerd bij goud heb ik me dan maar wat ingehouden en heb ik mijn vuist in de lucht gestoken ik heb ook de kroatische tafeltennisser zoran primorac omhelsd die eigenlijk een halve belg is

7075285 maar als de nacht valt transformeert de oude markt in een oord waar gespuis opduikt en waar je tussen twee en acht s ochtends beter wegblijft
7075286 de cijfers van de politie liegen er niet om er zijn nog altijd opstootjes en vechtpartijen
7075287 ik kan begrijpen dat er mensen zijn die overdag wegblijven op de oude markt als ze geregeld in de kranten lezen over nachtelijke baldadigheden ik wil ook iedereen aanmanen om er weg te blijven vanaf twee uur s nachts
7075288 toen ik destijds sprak over een sluitingsuur was het groot alarm wel ik spreek er niet meer over maar de caf bazen moeten dan ook niet komen klagen dat ze met een imagoprobleem zitten en als ze denken dat wij een speciale compagnie agenten ter beschikking stellen om een oogje in het zeil te houden op de markt dan hebben ze het ook mis

7075298 the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial ayers has long taught at uic where the chicago annenberg challenge offices were housed rent free ayers likely arranged for the files of the chicago annenberg challenge to be housed in the uic library and may well have been consulted during my unsuccessful struggle to gain access to the documents

7075302 why did i even ask to go to this place
7075303 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7075304 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7075305 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7075306 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7075307 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7075308 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7075309 what a lovely shop with an even lovelier selection of goods

7075495 i have said all along i feel i have a lot to offer
7075496 with all the ankle operations and all the questions over me if i didnt think i could play this type of cricket i wouldnt have gone through it all again
7075497 it will only be through performances that ultimately i will be judged
7075498 i have not scored 50 for a while so it was nice to stick my bat up i didnt know what to do
7075499 kevin realises i have worked hard on my batting and i think he was just as pleased as i was
7075500 he wants me to play my natural game and the way in which he has seen me bat and knows i can do
7075501 you can play with no fear you can play with freedom but you cant be reckless
7075502 there is a balance for us all to find and hopefully the recklessness is behind me
7075503 i played to my strengths and was quite calculated in the way i played now i have to keep doing that
7075504 i got a few out of the middle early on and gave myself a chance by looking at a few
7075505 i have got a sound technique i feel and a method which has worked in the past
7075506 it is just building on that i have been working with phil on my balance making sure my head is not going over i have two eyes on the ball and i am playing it late
7075507 it was when kevin and i had been at the crease for a while when i decided to take it on a little bit more
7075508 it helped batting with him hes obviously a fine player and he can make things look easy at times
7075509 very single minded determined and that has rubbed off on the rest of the team
7075510 he is very up front with his views and the way he plays his cricket and as a team we are doing that well
7075511 for me as well i am back to a role which i feel comfortable in
7075512 i always enjoy playing with the big lad he is a class act

7075516 coming back was up to him it was his decision but if he carries on the way he is doing he is going to help the sides success
7075517 in some places the practice of eucharistic adoration has been almost completely abandoned
7075518 it is my hope that the present encyclical letter will effectively help to banish the dark clouds of unacceptable doctrine and practice so that the eucharist will continue to shine forth in all its radiant mystery
7075519 the eucharist as christs saving presence in the community of the faithful and its spiritual food is the most precious possession that the church can have in her journey through history
7075520 the eucharist is a sacrifice in the strict sense and not only in a general way as if it were simply a matter of christs offering himself to the faithful as their spiritual food the gift of his love and obedience to the point of giving his life is in the first place a gift to his father certainly it is a gift given for our sake and indeed that of all humanity yet it is first and foremost a gift to the father
7075521 in instituting it he did not merely say this is my body this is my blood but went on to add which is given for you which is poured out for you jesus did not simply state that what he was giving them to eat and drink was his body and his blood he also expressed its sacrificial meaning and made sacramentally present his sacrifice which would soon be offered on the cross for the salvation of all
7075522 there remains the boundary indicated by paul vi every theological explanation that seeks some understanding of this mystery in order to be in accord with catholic faith must firmly maintain that in objective reality independently of our mind the bread and wine have ceased to exist after the consecration so that the adorable body and blood of the lord jesus from that moment on are really before us under the sacramental species of bread and wine
7075523 the worship of the eucharist outside of the mass is of inestimable value for the life of the church
7075524 it is pleasant to spend time with him to lie close to his breast like the beloved disciple and to feel the infinite love present in his heart if in our time christians must be distinguished above all by the art of prayer how can we not feel a renewed need to spend time in spiritual converse in silent adoration in heartfelt love before christ present in the most holy sacrament how often dear brother and sisters have i experienced this and drawn from it strength consolation and support
7075525 this practice repeatedly praised and recommended by the magisterium is supported by the example of many saints
7075526 it is the responsibility of pastors to encourage also by their personal witness the practice of eucharistic adoration and exposition of the blessed sacrament in particular as well as prayer of adoration before christ present under the eucharistic species
7075527 is a gift that radically transcends the power of the assembly the assembly gathered together for the celebration of the eucharist if it is to be a truly eucharistic assembly absolutely requires the presence of an ordained priest as its president
7075528 it is the ordained priest who acting in the person of christ brings about the eucharistic sacrifice and offers it to god in the name of all the people for this reason the roman missal prescribes that only the priest should recite the eucharistic prayer while the people participate in faith and in silence
7075529 when a community lacks a priest attempts are rightly made somehow to remedy the situation so that it can continue its sunday celebrations but such solutions must be considered merely temporary while the community awaits a priest
7075530 the sacramental incompleteness of these celebrations should above all inspire the whole community to pray with greater fervor that the lord will send laborers into his harvest it should also be an incentive to mobilize all the resources needed for an adequate pastoral promotion of vocations without yielding to the temptation to seek solutions that lower the moral and formative standards demanded of candidates for the priesthood
7075531 have a responsibility therefore to keep alive in the community a genuine hunger for the eucharist so that no opportunity for the celebration of mass will ever be missed also taking advantage of the occasional presence of a priest who is not impeded by church law from celebrating mass
7075532 the catholic faithful therefore while respecting the religious convictions of these separated brethren must refrain from receiving the communion distributed in their celebrations so as not to condone an ambiguity about the nature of the eucharist and consequently to fail in their duty to bear clear witness to the truth this would result in slowing the progress being made toward full visible unity
7075533 catholics may not receive communion in those communities that lack a valid sacrament of orders
7075534 it is unthinkable to substitute for sunday mass ecumenical celebrations of the word or services of common prayer with christians from the aforementioned ecclesial communities or even participation in their own liturgical services such celebrations and services however praiseworthy in certain situations prepare for the goal of full communion including eucharistic communion but they cannot replace it
7075535 entails communion in the teaching of the apostles in the sacraments and in the churchs hierarchical order
7075536 in christ and through the working of the holy spirit unites us to the father and among ourselves
7075537 along these same lines the catechism of the catholic church rightly stipulates that anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of reconciliation before coming to communion
7075538 the judgment of ones state of grace obviously belongs only to the person involved since it is a question of examining ones conscience however in cases of outward conduct that is seriously clearly and steadfastly contrary to the moral norm the church in her pastoral concern for the good order of the community and out of respect for the sacrament cannot fail to feel directly involved the code of canon law refers to this situation of a manifest lack of proper moral disposition when it states that those who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to eucharistic communion
7075539 in this case in fact the intention is to meet a grave spiritual need for the eternal salvation of an individual believer not to bring about an intercommunion that remains impossible until the visible bonds of ecclesial communion are fully re established
7075540 if they ask on their own for the sacraments and are properly disposed
7075541 if the danger of death is present or other grave necessity in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or the conference of bishops catholic ministers may licitly administer these sacraments to other christians who do not have full communion with the catholic church who cannot approach a minister of their own community and on their own ask for it provided they manifest catholic faith in these sacraments and are properly disposed
7075542 these conditions from which no dispensation can be given must be carefully respected even though they deal with specific individual cases the faithful observance of the body of norms established in this area is a manifestation and at the same time a guarantee of our love for jesus christ in the blessed sacrament for our brothers and sisters of different christian confessions who have a right to our witness to the truth and for the cause itself of the promotion of unity
7075543 it must be lamented that especially in the years following the post conciliar liturgical reform as a result of a misguided sense of creativity and adaptation there have been a number of abuses that have been a source of suffering for many
7075544 i consider it my duty therefore to appeal urgently that the liturgical norms for the celebration of the eucharist be observed with great fidelity these norms are a concrete expression of the authentically ecclesial nature of the eucharist this is their deepest meaning liturgy is never anyones private property be it of the celebrant or of the community in which the mysteries are celebrated
7075545 priests who faithfully celebrate mass according to the liturgical norms and communities that conform to those norms quietly but eloquently demonstrate their love for the church
7075546 precisely to bring out more clearly this deeper meaning of liturgical norms i have asked the competent offices of the roman curia to prepare a more specific document including prescriptions of a juridical nature on this very important subject no one is permitted to undervalue the mystery entrusted to our hands it is too great for anyone to feel free to treat it lightly and with disregard for its sacredness and its universality
7075547 think that i that am a christian king under the
7075548 in these dark days we desperately need christian artists who will love god with all their hearts minds souls and strength and who will pour that love into unique creative expressions of truth that have the power to bridge into the souls of others
7075549 be bold in what you stand for and careful what you fall for

7075551 morne and albie are certainly in our first choice starting line up so to have both of them out was a big disappointment
7075552 we wanted to come out and play with our first choice side and what it does is that it also disrupts our balance hugely at number seven and number eight we didnt have a guy who can hit the ball out of the ground
7075553 when youre needing a big over albie is the guy who can hit it out of the ground for you we had johan botha and vernon philander who can work it around quite nicely but they needed to be batting with someone who was in and who could hit boundaries at will so that was a pity
7075554 to be honest im a little bit worried about him
7075555 were hoping to give him an injection and the physio is working with him all the time we thought he could have played in the twenty20 at durham last week and yesterday he bowled 12 balls and he felt it slightly
7075556 i could see that when he bowled even though it was indoors off a short run up that he was labouring and wasnt confident to pull through with his action because of that strain there was not point playing him and we hope another four days will make him 100 per cent right
7075557 we need to work on our death bowling because we went for 95 in the last 10 overs
7075558 i dont want to make any excuses but we havent been able to practice outdoors and the bowlers were unable to do it indoors
7075559 we saw all of the top order get in but nobody took it through so that was disappointing and being rusty or having a lack of preparation doesnt affect that when your batters get in they should take it through
7075560 every loss hurts a lot and the worrying thing is we didnt play very well and i thought england played very well
7075561 but if you look at england in terms of their spectrum they were probably about 5 per cent off the best game they could play and we were 20 per cent off ours and yet we got within 20 runs and thats been my message to the guys
7075562 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7075563 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7075564 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7075565 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7075566 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7075567 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7075568 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7075569 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for that we have competition for places
7075570 when i was first told how serious my cancer was my first thought was for my boys i sat there shaking thinking how on earth can i explain this to my babies then when i was told i needed an urgent hysterectomy i broke down at the thought of never having more children i have always longed for a baby girl then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win

7075574 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7075575 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7075576 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand

7075584 whats the matter charlie are you afraid your technology skills arent up to par shouldnt you understand the technology better if youre going to do a web startup
7075585 apparently at least if you listen to the pundits one of his obamas weaknesses is foreign policy and joe biden from what i have heard and seen on tv is very intelligent when it comes to those issues he is older and that complements barack obama being younger and thats a smart decision
7075586 it looks like a young man is trying to pick an old man and he is younger than i am but still balancing the ticket im not so sure about bidens stand on things i have to look into that
7075587 that could hurt him he needs to be really really really strong

7075626 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7075627 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7075628 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7075629 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7075630 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7075631 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7075632 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7075633 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7075634 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans
7075635 he has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of sen john mccain
7075636 joe brings experience to baracks message of change together democrats are offering the american people change experience and good judgment a winning combination if there ever was one
7075637 joe biden has always been my first choice and i am pleased to learn he is sen obamas first choice as well i am proud of joe and believe his experience in the u s senate and as a national leader in foreign policy makes him an excellent candidate for vice president
7075638 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7075639 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy

7075653 but even with obama theres still no contest against the republicans how do you argue for four more years the economys terrible americans are being killed in iraq and afghanistan its been a disaster
7075654 i think barack obama will turn all that around he will ease the energy crisis and the recession do away with corporate welfare and ease a lot of the suffering of the american public
7075655 im a recovering catholic i havent been to church in a long time it all stems from politics

7075678 ndr sorride abbiamo gi due trofei la franz beckenbauer cup e leusebio cup due grandi nomi nel calcio mondiale scherzi a parte la supercoppa sempre la prima competizione ufficiale della stagione e si affrontano sempre due squadre che hanno terminato la stagione precedente con gioia e fiducia infatti entrambe hanno vinto in questo momento la supercoppa la competione pi importante della stagione perch la partita che giochiamo domani ed io domani non penso ne alla champions ne al campionato mi interessa solo la gara con la roma con tutto quello che abbiamo qualit emozione fiducia empatia insomma giocheremo con tutte le nostre qualit i tifosi probabilmente avranno in mente campionato e coppa come le competizioni pi importanti ma domani giochiamo la supercoppa e credo che anche loro debbano considerare adesso questa gara come la pi importante in assoluto abbiamo la fortuna e il privilegio di giocare in casa nostra credo che i nostri tifosi possano fare un p la differenza in posistivo come i tifosi della roma lavranno fatta in casa loro nella finale di tim cup se domani la gente nerazzurra pu far sentire forza ed emozioni per noi sar importante
7075679 il giorno prima di giocare la supercoppa devo dire che i miei venti convocati sono i giocatori pi forti del mondo non voglio pensare in altro modo non considero in questo momento i giocatori indisponibili non ho bisogno di loro quei venti sono perfetti per giocare domani e ancora meno penso ai giocatori che non sono dellinter in questo momento il mercato aperto fino al primo settembre come una porta di un saloon che si pu aprire in entrambe le direzioni in questo momento sono pi che soddisfatto dei giocatori che ho a disposizione
7075680 questi tre sono i giocatori che posso schierare come difensori centrali materazzi quasi pronto ma abbiamo deciso insieme di proteggere la situazione in vista del campionato e della coppa in modo che lui possa essere al cento per cento in quelle occasioni cordoba samuel e chivu non sono ancora pronti abbiamo tre giocatori a disposizione e sono quelli che hanno occupato quel ruolo nel pre campionato perci non abbiamo probelemi burdisso ha fatto molto bene rivas ha disputato due belle gara a di amsterdam cambiasso un giocatore molto intelligente che pu adattarsi ho queste tre possibilit per noi una situazione perfetta non mi piace avere troppi difensori tra il campo e la panchina questi tre sono pi che sufficienti poi con maicon maxwell e zanetti ho tre opzioni per le posizioni di esterni difensivi
7075681 questa la vita nel calcio chiss se fra quattro o cinque anni trover una squadra da allenare la vita
7075682 posso parlare di stankovic dal primo giorno che lho conosciuto e abbiamo parlato nel mio ufficio gli ho detto che sono un allenatore onesto il primo giorno arrivato con tanti dubbi perch cerano delle voci su di lui gli ho risposto che per me non importa quello che succede nel periodo di vacanza se lui lavora bene e ha motivazione lui lo ha fatto e in questo momento un giocatore a disposizione per domani
7075683 vediamo come ho gi detto la porta aperta in entrambe le direzioni ancora per una settimana in pre campionato abbiamo lavorato per giocare in due modi diversi se ci sono figo e mancini possiamo giocare con due ali altrimenti possiamo cambiare modulo ho una squadra con una cultura tattica un gruppo che lavora bene e pu giocare in modi diversi abbiamo tante opzioni non vivo in questo momento con lapprensione di sapere che fra una settimana chiude il mercato e di sapere se arriva questo o quello sono assolutamente soddisfatto della nostra situazione
7075684 totti un giocatore fantastico e tutti siamo daccordo ma loro lavorano da tanti anni insieme e sicuramente non un dramma per loro sapere se lui gioca o meno lanno scorso sono stati mesi senza totti si sono adattati e si sono giocati fino allultimo il campionato linter ha avuto sempre la loro pressione dietro e stiamo parlando di una roma senza totti che ha fatto sempre molto bene non conosco la mentlit di spalletti non so se come faccio io dir che non ha bisogno dei giocatori che non possono giocare ma questa la mia filosofia prima delle gare pi importanti non so se totti giocher ma posso dire che mi piace come calciatore sono daccordo nel dire che loro hanno giocato molto bene lanno scorso ma la storia del calcio quella dei titoli e lo scudetto rimasto a milano perch linter ha vinto in coppa italia e supercoppa hanno vinto loro domani queste due squadre ora un p diverse si riaffrontano e ci sar una squadra che ha vinto due titoli contro una che ne ha vinto uno pi importante dobbiamo rispettare i nostri avversari non averne paura il giorno che avremo paura di qualcuno meglio iniziare a giocare nel giardino con i propri figli
7075685 la cosa non mi preoccupa perch ho giocato a carte scoperte come a poker quando le carte sono tutte in tavola ho detto ad alcuni miei giocatori che avrei piacere se qualcuno avesse la possibilit di scegliere il proprio futuro le carte sono in tavola tu e tu fuori dalla champions league tu e tu avete poche possibilit di giocare se restate una vostra decisione ma non bussate alla porta del mio ufficio per chiedermi il motivo per cui giocate poco io con una o due settimane di anticipo dalla chiusura del mercato ho spiegato a tutti quale era la situazione per me non un problema se tutti decidono di restare restano tutti giocatori dellinter tra laltro lavorano tutti molto bene non un problema per me averli in gruppo sono opzioni in pi e rispetto i contratti tra i giocatori e il mio club
7075686 ndr sorride prima di tutto credo che il chelsea debba fare un dvd di questa partita e venderlo nei negozi di londra cos come ci sono tanti dvd delle partite passate ad esempio chelsea barcelona 4 2 in champions league un dvd che ha venduto migliaia di copie forse meglio sostituire questa partita con il dvd di chelsea portsmouth laltra cosa positiva che ora posso andare a londra con tranquillit prima per me era impossibile vista la passione dei tifosi ora positivo perch sono pi tranquillo
7075687 this is a fight very much to the death for our very way of life to protect and preserve it from people whose qualities include intolerance bigotry hatred and downright bestiality the sooner this is realized by all pakistanis by the state and its various institutions and by the present government the better
7075688 the printing press is the greatest weapon in the armory of the modern commander
7075689 mi piace di pi giocare che allenare giocare grandi partite mi piace molto ed assolutamente il senso del nostro lavoro domani non giochiamo la finale di champions league ma la supercoppa una partita da giocare ho gi vinto in portogallo e in inghilterrra dove ne ho persa anche una ora spero di vincerne una anche in italia e domani avr questoccasione giusto che tanti tifosi non ci saranno domani perch parecchi saranno ancora in vacanza per mi aspetto lo stesso un bel pubblico ieri mi hanno detto che potrebbero essere quarantamila oggi mi hanno detto che potranno essere tra i quarantamila e i cinquantamila ovviamente san siro molto grande ma credo che latmosfera per giocare sar bella credo che arriveranno anche parecchi tifosi da roma e penso che sia una cosa interessante
7075690 la squadra sta molto bene in condizione per poter vincere
7075691 difficile paragonare squadre di periodi diversi il calcio cambia i giocatori cambiano non mi sembra positivo fare il pargone con una squadra che ha vinto tanti titoli importate quello che pensiamo io e la squadra lavoriamo insieme in un gruppo parliamo di idee e sensazioni e in questo momento le sensazioni di tutti sono molto positive i giocatori sono felici e vanno in campo con fiducia a tutti piacerebbe avere il gruppo al completo ma il giorno prima di una gara importante non voglio parlare dei giocartori squalificati o infortunati ho 20 giocatori da impiegare e conto molto su di loro avete la lista dei convocati per domani sono tutti in grado di giocare sono molto tranquillo nel calcio poi si pu vincere pareggiare o perdere ma dal mio punto di vista le sensazioni alla vigilia sono molto positive siamo pieni di fiducia
7075692 oggi possiamo fare questo discorso e sar sempre lo stesso quando d una lista di convocati che voi avrete in mano prima della conferenza stampa non ci sar mai in questo elenco un giocatore non in grado di scendere in campo

7075950 it is still unfortunate that in many places changes come from on high with little consultation with staff
7075951 the most important part of the process has been more effective communication which is how it should have been from the beginning

7075964 the newspaper has been redesigned saving memphis publishing co about 6 percent in paper
7075965 the key issue for us is to make sure that the core news coverage continues

7075972 this research highlights the need to apply a customer centric approach to online advertising and should be welcomed by agencies and brands alike
7075973 the newsroom staff producing the paper is also smaller younger more tech savvy and more oriented to serving the demands of both print and the web the staff also is under greater pressure has less institutional memory less knowledge of the community of how to gather news and the history of individual beats there are fewer editors to catch mistakes
7075974 almost every newspaper is trying to appeal to female readers in crude commercial terms females are the main shoppers in more than 50 of households and advertisers want to appeal to people who shop so they have the opportunity to buy their product
7075975 the problem lies in conflating female interest with celebrity story and although its been a successful formula i think its one thats coming to the end of its usefulness in terms of shifting copies
7075976 in the uk the daily mail has the highest percentage of female readers and unsurprisingly this increases its appeal for advertisers

7075983 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
7075984 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
7075985 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
7075986 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
7075987 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern
7075988 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
7075989 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics
7075990 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry
7075991 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects

7075996 i just focused on relaxing for the first half so i could have a big second half in hindsight maybe i didnt relax enough in the first half
7075997 but i was excited and honestly i just wanted to get it done and thats what i did
7075998 i didnt really sleep last night i felt like everything was getting turned upside down and i didnt know why i was searching but also trying to ignore it because it wasnt really the time to look for answers
7075999 im exhausted im tired i dont know what it is but this isnt my best regatta
7076000 but im really happy to pull through with a medal for canada its not the colour i expected but i didnt earn the gold today and this is what i deserve
7076001 quite frankly the way were going right now were going to have to reassess what our goals and objectives are for london 2012 because theres a good chance we could achieve our london objective here
7076002 our objective for london was top 12 but i think were sitting near that right now in overall medals
7076003 a lot of good things attitudinally are happening here too
7076004 i dont know if everybody feels this way but im watching events and im saying whoa we just missed the gold where we used to say darn it were fourth we missed getting a medal now were starting to think gold
7076005 i dont want to be like the toronto maple leafs where every time they have a bad year they just shuffle the deck a little bit and hope they get dealt some good cards the next year
7076006 were not doing that we have a vision of where we want to go and were going to continue to build on that
7076007 we didnt have a lot of extra money this time so alex baumann and the road to excellence program used it where they thought it would have the biggest impact

7076016 when did the relationship start and what was your client doing at the time
7076017 its my understanding my client met the assemblyman in the early to mid part of 2003 whe she was working as an intern for an assemblywoman
7076018 yes the relationship did continue for some period of time after my client had ceased working as an intern for the assembly
7076019 what has this past week been like for her with all of this publicity
7076020 well its a non event to my client she never wanted this to certainly come to the medias attention this relationship concluded more than three years ago
7076021 no truth to it whatsoever unfortunately assemblyman hoyt did what he did and i dont think anyone made him do what he did
7076022 who does plan for their x rated e mail messages to go public
7076023 i have campaigned with joe biden in northeastern pennsylvania numerous times and look forward to joining him on the campaign trail again this year
7076024 if biden gives that little extra boost to obama in places like the scranton wilkes barre area in a tight race like the 11th its a nice add on for kanjorski
7076025 generally the traditional democratic constituent groups in the state are going to look at this and say you know what i think we can count on obama
7076026 biden speaks to a constituency that is very important in the very democratic party
7076027 suppose rendell would have a heart attack god forbid then youd have the executive branch headless obviously the lieutenant governor would not be able to perform the duties of governor

7076058 no merece ni la pena son cantos al sol ya que para recibir cualquier subvenci n hay que estar al corriente hasta de una simple multa de tr fico al final los tr mites y la burocracia te hacen perder un par de d as y para esas cuant as es una verg enza no compensa
7076059 en ella se comprometieron a sacar m s ayudas y m s cuant as individuales y adem s el acuerdo se refer a tanto a la instalaci n de mamparas como de c maras de seguridad pero con esa cantidad los 300 euros el ayuntamiento de madrid demuestra su falta de sensibilidad hacia el sector

7076171 you try to gauge talent and its tough to go in that direction because talent doesnt always win
7076172 it comes down to cohesiveness of a unit how well guys work together how much they want it and how hard they work there are a lot more factors that go into creating a championship team than just talent

7076199 bullet injured aziz was brought to the hospital with protruding intestines on aug 11
7076200 he aziz was brought dead we couldnt conduct any post mortem because the body was soon taken by an angry mob for funeral
7076201 pierced through azizs body and even forensic experts cannot say what kind of bullet hit him
7076202 the bullet had entered the left side of his back and left from the right side
7076203 we have just lodged firs first information reports and detailed investigations would be launched soon
7076204 pakistan backed separatists have been using the tool of political killing to stoke anti india passions in the valley but i am not sure if azizs death falls in that category
7076205 nobody is going to believe this narayanans theory he was killed in police and paramilitary firing and i am an eyewitness to that
7076206 aziz fell to the forces bullets in front of senior administrative and police officials

7076224 much of the panic and hysteria surrounding children today is focussed on their safety many kids are
7076225 of course beyond the academic reasons for keeping homework on a tight rein lies the deeper question

7076228 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7076229 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7076230 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7076231 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7076232 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7076233 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7076234 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
7076235 regardless of who is behind those terrorists the abu bekr mosque bombing is easy to interpret as a russian or armenian provocation for the purpose of causing a conflict between azerbaijan and iran then finding a pretext for russian intervention in azerbaijan
7076236 i felt i kind of got out well but when i turned the bend i just felt like i had nothing thats my slowest time all season right now i feel wrecked
7076237 theres absolutely no doubt about it but irelands success in boxing at these olympics are as a direct result of the support and funding thats been given to the sport over the past number of years
7076238 the introduction of a high performance programme and an increase in funding has paid dividends
7076239 the medals are great but thats not the only story
7076240 boxing clubs have noticed an increase in membership as a result of the initiative this is a tangible example of sport doing good for the community and by the nature of boxings traditional support base this is helping some of the most disadvantaged people in society
7076241 either the talent just isnt there or the talent isnt being brought out that should be brought out
7076242 there are a lot of good people out there they are not getting the results that they should be getting
7076243 everything is measurable in some form or fashion and we must take a good solid measurement on this or otherwise well be doing this interview post london post 2016 post 2010 if something isnt done hard decisions have to be made no one wants disappointment no one wants to be coming in last no one wants to be straggling behind
7076244 i want to stress that the sports council is not afraid to set targets but our remit is not just about the elite end of sport but the wider grassroots picture
7076245 returns in the form of medals can be achieved when funding is increased thats clear but its not an exact science
7076246 if the raw materials arent there in an athlete he or she cant be turned into a world beater irrespective of the amount of money sent their way
7076247 it also takes time to see a return on investment thats happened with the british olympic team this year where support and facilities were put in place many years ago and its going to get even better for them because they will be hosting the 2012 games so every discipline will have state of the art amenities
7076248 you know there was a velodrome planned for the original
7076249 last year the council was criticised for its funding of boxing following the world championships but a knee jerk reaction to stop the money would have been a huge mistake now thanks to paddy barnes kenny egan and darren sutherland the country sees that this investment has paid off

7076392 the results of the survey demonstrate that women understand the importance of a healthy smile but worryingly they are not prepared to spend the time and money looking after their teeth fear of the dentist is an age old problem 24 are not willing to undergo corrective treatment based on fear but new treatments such as invisalign which is a non invasive procedure using a series of clear plastic aligners to straighten your teeth have been popular as they are discreet and because they are removable patients can brush and floss as normal invisalign gives me the chance to straighten teeth but without many of the treatment barriers that cause my patients to shy away from with traditional metal dental braces the cost for treatment is a lifetime investment so when you compare this to how much women spend on beauty treatments it is minimal
7076393 orissa is home to more than 50 percent of the worlds turtle population the state needs to protect the nesting beaches which are now threatened by beach erosion that may force the turtles to abandon the state for ever
7076394 there has been unprecedented erosion at puri we feel it could be correlated to the opening of a new mouth at chilika lake in 2000 which connects to the seawater
7076395 this could be an ecological disaster for villages and the wildlife found in the lake as the brackish water lake is turning into a saline ecosystem due to a huge influx of seawater
7076396 this is expected to lead to a serious loss of biodiversity and affect the habitat of the rare irrawady dolphins and migratory water fowl
7076397 however we are sure that as per studies undertaken recently erosion is going on and it is increasing year after year

7076411 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
7076412 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
7076413 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in terms of widespread impact
7076414 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future

7076422 es una prueba muy importante para el equipo con un resultado parecido al de champions del a o pasado ante el roma venimos con una derrota corta pero posible de remontar los peque os detalles ser n importantes hay que tener paciencia para no cometer errores
7076423 los mec nicos han hecho un gran trabajo pero felipe massa ha sido mejor espero mejorar ma ana porque nos hemos esforzado mucho en la preparaci n de este circuito
7076424 creo que ser decisivo mantener la posici n en la zona limpia del circuito desde la misma salida
7076425 ha sido una clasificaci n estupenda he de felicitar a todo mi equipo porque el coche ha estado fant stico y cada vez estamos m s cerca de ferrari y mclaren
7076426 las ruedas se comportan bien aunque no hay demasiada adherencia as que vamos a intentar no cometer los mismos errores que en hungria no es un secreto que fallamos estrepitosamente con la presi n de los neum ticos
7076427 hay varios sitios en los que se puede adelantar pero va a ser muy complicado porque pr cticamente todos estamos rodando en los mismos tiempos y es peligroso rodar fuera del carril limpio
7076428 la cuarta posici n no es lo que yo estaba buscando pero no es el fin del mundo he bloqueado las ruedas en varios puntos durante la q3 y he perdido un tiempo muy valioso en este circuito un peque o error es muy costoso

7076463 joe biden is an outstanding public servant with deep experience and a fighting spirit
7076464 these qualities will make him a great asset in the white house and on the campaign trail this fall indiana and america face challenging times we are a nation at war with an economy on the rocks in his most important decision to date barack obama demonstrated the judgment to choose a governing partner who is wise and strong and will help him deliver change to a country yearning for it

7076483 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without
7076484 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7076485 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7076486 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7076487 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7076488 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7076489 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7076490 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better

7076497 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7076498 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7076520 es el nico que tiene la capacidad de decidir sobre lo que ocurre a bordo del avi n tanto si se puede bajar como si no
7076521 con ello no quiero insinuar que la responsabilidad fue del comandante en alg n aspecto que pudo fallar sino que su facultad es la de evaluar la situaci n en cada vuelo

7076525 decidi que ese lector no estaba registrando la temperatura adecuada y pidi regresar al hangar para que le hicieran una revisi n como se ala el procedimiento porque ning n vuelo de spanair se opera sin que el comandante tenga la plena confianza y seguridad de que ese avi n est en par metros adecuados para volar
7076526 plenamente recogido por el fabricante la compa a y los t cnicos de mantenimiento por lo que se certific y se document siguiendo normas reguladas por aviaci n espa ola y ese avi n sali en condiciones de seguridad ptimas
7076527 no existe una normativa que impida que una persona voluntariamente pueda bajarse del avi n
7076528 el comandante tiene la facultad de darle salida a ese vuelo y eso es lo que ocurri lo que pas despu s desafortunadamente no podemos especular ni entrar a hablar de ello porque es una competencia exclusiva de la comisi n de investigaci n
7076529 es normal que en cualquier compa a con el volumen de operaci n de spanair con 300 vuelos al d a y 10 millones de pasajeros al a o tengamos incidencias t cnicas pero para eso tenemos un complejo de infraestructuras y personal que est n plenamente avalados por las autoridades a trav s de inspecciones continuas para dar soluci n a cualquier problema

7076534 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7076535 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7076536 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7076537 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7076538 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7076539 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7076540 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7076541 who are open to doing something on the production side
7076542 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7076543 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7076544 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7076545 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7076546 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7076547 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7076548 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7076549 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7076550 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7076551 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7076552 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7076553 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7076554 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7076555 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7076556 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7076557 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7076558 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7076559 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7076560 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7076561 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7076562 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7076563 country walking pulls out all the stops to offer you 100 guaranteed gobsmacker walks and you can get them all for free

7076565 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7076566 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7076567 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7076568 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7076569 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7076570 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7076571 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7076572 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7076573 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7076574 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7076575 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7076576 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7076577 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7076578 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7076579 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7076580 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7076581 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7076582 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7076583 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7076584 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7076585 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7076586 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7076587 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7076588 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7076589 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7076590 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7076591 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7076592 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7076593 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7076594 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7076595 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7076596 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7076597 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7076598 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7076599 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7076600 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7076601 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7076602 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7076603 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7076604 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7076605 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7076606 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7076607 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7076608 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7076609 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7076675 joe biden is an outstanding choice for vice president his foreign policy knowledge is unparalleled and his humble pennsylvania roots give him a deep understanding of the challenges facing ohio families
7076676 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else
7076677 apparently they think paid sick days are unworkable and economically harmful only if regular people are able to earn them

7076708 nato asks all the member states every year what efforts they can make in afghanistan but we were not specifically asked to send more troops

7076710 convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
7076711 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7076712 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7076713 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7076714 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7076715 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7076716 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7076717 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations
7076718 in the end people will vote for someone they know
7076719 hell be treated like a casey a scranton a rodham
7076720 i dont think this will totally satisfy some of senator clintons backers but once local boy joe biden comes home and gets them on board i think it will help a lot
7076721 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7076722 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7076723 how can you be a leader of anything if you cant be a leader of your home
7076724 i walk the streets and people say please run as a write in
7076725 if she cant take care of herself then how is she going to take care of other people while serving in congress

7076727 i dont vote for someone just because theyre the only one running for a particular position

7076733 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7076734 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7076735 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7076736 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7076737 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7076738 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices

7076740 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7076741 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7076742 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7076743 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7076744 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7076745 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7076746 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail
7076747 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7076748 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7076749 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7076750 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7076751 india appeals to pakistan not to encourage infiltration and the recent cross border firing in which we lost lives of a few armed personal is viewed with all seriousness and the indian armed forces are prepared to face any eventuality

7076753 the cpi m had made it clear to the dmk that it should decide whether to join hands with congress or with it cpi m
7076754 a party press release said the cpi m had categorically told the dmk that it cannot continue in an alliance which had congress in it despite dmks appeal to the left parties to stay put in the democratic progressive alliance in tamil nadu to fight against communal forces
7076755 historically cpi m has never sided with the communal bjp or the congress and would make all efforts to float a third front in tamil nadu that would not have either of the parties

7076924 michael leavitt secretary of health and human services representing the bush administration got it right when he said putting doctors or anyone who assists them in a position where they are forced to violate their consciences in order to meet a standard of competence violates more than federal law leavitt further summed up the issue at stake when he stated this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience

7076936 con algunos prejuicios sobre que se hacen monjas las chicas menos atractivas
7076937 fotos bonitas y expresivas que muestren la belleza tanto en el plano est tico como espiritual
7076938 una monja santa inteligente pero tambi n guapa puede dar mucho en la misi n de la evangelizaci n y de la pastoral juvenil
7076939 vivimos en tiempos en los que la visibilidad es muy importante y puede servir a las monjas para que se conozca su instituto o el carisma de una fundaci n religiosa
7076940 la imagen que se tiene de que las monjas son mujeres tristes desilusionadas de la vida y no realizadas

7076954 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7076955 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7076956 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7076957 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7076958 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7076959 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems

7076973 o benfica deve ser ambicioso por um lado e humilde por outro

7076985 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7076986 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7076987 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7076988 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7076989 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7076990 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7076991 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7076992 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy

7076997 although hes not from arizona originally but forgot where hes from someone enlighten me
7076998 wonder if the paul supporters will vote for mccain well have to wait and see
7076999 its also interesting to note that if he loses this nomination it will be the first and only time he has lost any election ever

7077136 somebody whos going to be able to give obama good advice and counsel
7077137 reflects concern even within obamas own campaign about whether hes ready to be president
7077138 barack obamas politics of change era is over now that hes chosen longtime washington insider joe biden as his running mate
7077139 rising food and fuel prices could spark social instability here they could even start strikes there is a real risk and the government has to understand that
7077140 it is the rice importers who had to put pressure on the government to do something about rice prices because they were shooting up so high that no one would buy their rice
7077141 we dont know if people here in bissau are particularly in need we have no figures
7077142 every year i propose to the ministry of finance to increase the agricultural budget but in vain
7077143 we are in a less dramatic situation in comparison to last year and at the moment there is no risk of famine in the country
7077144 they need to plant manioc peanuts potatoes vegetables there is a lot of potential here for agriculture and it has to start at a grassroots level

7077147 last year we produced a small crop because we had bad rains we saw neighbouring villages were improving their harvest by digging dikes to store rainwater but we didnt know how to do it
7077148 so we decided to organise ourselves and started by setting up a committee
7077149 we are preparing the land so we can transplant our rice seeds from nurseries around the village out to the rice fields in august
7077150 guiarroz also put us in touch with an ngo non governmental organisation that would provide us with rice seeds and now wfp is giving us rice to eat while we plant our harvest
7077151 people tell us we must become less reliant on rice and grow other crops like maize
7077152 we used the seeds to set up our own cereal stock to distribute seeds and food to each family in the village
7077153 now that were more organised when we have problems we go to guiarroz and they try to help us they helped us when rain from dikes overflowed into our rice fields
7077154 we are preparing our land but we do it mostly by hand so it takes weeks we have rented two bullocks from a man in the village to do it more quickly and with them we think it will take 20 days we have to pay us 23 50 per day for the bullocks and it is hard for us to afford
7077155 we are also starting to plant onions and other vegetables to try to raise additional money to pay for childrens school fees they cost about us 47 a year

7077276 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7077277 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7077278 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7077279 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7077280 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7077281 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area

7077289 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7077290 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7077347 wir waren eigentlich ganz zufrieden wie sich die dinge entwickelten bis zum qualifying gestern bekamen wir die autos mit schwerer spritladung gut abgestimmt und erzielten ermutigende ergebnisse mit dem bremsverschlei die strecke war ziemlich rutschig und ver nderte sich fast jede runde hnlich wie in monaco wir nahmen ein paar anpassungen am setup vor etwas mehr abtrieb eine ge nderte gewichtsverteilung andere federraten und optimiertes ansprechverhalten der stabilisatoren
7077348 nach dem letzten freien training waren wir noch zuversichtlich das blieben wir auch noch nach dem ersten qualifying abschnitt leider konnte fernando in q2 nicht das optimum aus seinem auto rausholen und da die zeitabst nde an diesem wochenende so klein sind reichte das schon um es nicht ins top 10 zeitfahren zu schaffen
7077349 ja vor allem nach den ganzen verbesserungen der letzten wochen allerdings ist dieses wochenende l ngst nicht gelaufen sicher stehen wir vor einer schwierigen ausgangslage doch bei diesem streckenlayout ist jederzeit eine safety car phase m glich wir m ssen unsere strategie so w hlen dass wir aus solchen situationen einen vorteil ziehen k nnen
7077350 sie ist zumindest nicht ausgeschlossen wir werden auch dar ber nachdenken besonders f r nelson der als 15 startet mal sehen
7077351 ihr werdet die felgenverkleidungen im rennen nicht einsetzen warum das

7077377 the opening of the limnitis checkpoint is not connected to any other matter
7077378 we condemn all kinds of provocative actions that take place in that sensitive village of pyla wherever these may come from
7077379 our position regarding the issue of opening the limnitis checkpoint is well known and is not connected to anything else
7077380 we are working for the opening of the particular checkpoint as soon as possible because it will serve both the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots in the area
7077381 the repetition of the well known stance of the greek cypriots and the extension of the claims of the greek cypriot side for suzerainty on the island
7077382 the incident in pyla demonstrates the need for the presence of turkish troops on the island

7077429 it was a great moment and the feeling is mostly relief
7077430 yesterday i just didnt feel like myself today i was climbing back up getting it back a little bit but that last 200 still didnt feel like me it was a struggle a well fought struggle and im really really happy
7077431 i just focused on relaxing for the first half so i could have a big second half in hindsight maybe i didnt relax enough in the first half
7077432 but i was excited and honestly i just wanted to get it done and thats what i did

7077442 i felt horrible and i thought it could have been over on that jump
7077443 i went over to the side and i had half a mind to pull out of the jump but you dont do that at the olympics
7077444 before most things in my life i sort of get a feeling and the last couple of weeks it has just been crystalised in me that i can do this i can win this and i have been thinking about nothing else really
7077445 so in my mind i had already done it and i guess it was just a matter of playing it out in real life
7077446 i took a moment before jumping at 5 90 and just sat back and realised that i was doing something that every kid dreams of i had my destiny in my own hands evgeny lukyanenko was out of the competition
7077447 if i clear that bar i am the olympic gold medallist i did think i was the kind of person who could stand up and take that sort of opportunity on and make the most of it to have done it is a dream come true
7077448 the whole competition was mentally and physically the hardest thing ive done in my life it was more like boxing than pole vault
7077449 the big thing with me and one of my big changes in me is i dont think about the consequences of missing
7077450 i was just in the moment i didnt think about the interviews i would have to do if i missed and came fifth at the olympics
7077451 that is something in the past i have worried about but i was just in the moment
7077452 i was out there enjoying it i was loving being out there and being in a bit of dogfight with evgeny and that i think that was the difference
7077453 i loved it i loved having third attempt clearances and i loved it all being on the line it was cool
7077454 he didnt tell me because he alex is very superstitious
7077455 actually before osaka the taxi had pulled up and i was about to leave the apartment and i heard this almighty crash and a mirror had fallen off the wall
7077456 i knew i couldnt tell alex because he would freak out so when he lost the chain he was in a state but then he remembered he used to not wear shoes when emma george jumped so he took his shoes off
7077457 it is kind of cool having an olympian for a mum
7077458 both of my coaches have been the biggest influences on my life
7077459 without mark stewart i probably would never have even discovered pole vault and never would have had the early part of my career and never would have learnt to just be a fierce competitor and go at things balls out
7077460 then moving to perth alex has taught me all sorts of things about technique about being professional about lifestyle about everything
7077461 its something i would like to do in the future and i something i am aiming for

7077470 joe biden traz uma grande experi ncia em pol tica externa um impressionante recorde de colabora o em todas as linhas do partido e uma atitude direta para fazer o trabalho
7077471 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
7077472 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
7077473 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas na ve understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk
7077474 it became abundantly clear to me that if the lee network was going to accomplish its goals setting new and higher standards for feature dancing that an office in l a with partners who share my vision was going to be absolutely necessary in l a direct models and lisa anns talent management i found exactly what i was looking for people dedicated to the business of making performers career dreams come true
7077475 la direct models has worked cooperatively and well with lee network for many years we are delighted to cement that relationship in an even stronger manner formerly partnering with the lee network and lisa ann talent management to create what we believe will be without question the industry leader in the provision of feature dancer talent
7077476 i have been represented by the lee network since 1994 with the experience i have gained i now am excited to share with the new team la direct models lisa anns talent management and the lee network this is going to be a great value to our feature dancers and the production companies we will be promoting along with our feature dance bookings

7077487 we are not in natural history but we may need to broaden the sorts of genres of factual we are in
7077488 we need to make sure that we cover a range of bases in factual we should look at the areas we dont cover at the moment
7077489 there is absolutely no decision on that we will look at it when we get to the end of the run

7077491 he now presents for radio 2 the one show us a magazine show that talks in light terms about issues that affect people its something chris can do very well
7077492 we are now at the end of the multichannel era what we will see is a culling of up to 200 channels
7077493 some channels down the end of the electronic programming guide were the linear answer to more choice
7077494 if that choice is provided by vod services then many then dont necessarily need them
7077495 i do question about secondary channels we may see a lot disappear and frankly a lot of channels at the top of the epg also do live on archive programming like uktv
7077496 this will extend across series from drama factual bbc1 bbc2 bbc3 and bbc4

7077515 estimates vary but foreclosure listing company realtytrac approximated 261 255 homes in foreclosure in may of this year almost double the number in may 2007 the brookings institution estimates that vacant and abandoned properties of all kinds whether from foreclosure or not occupy about 15 percent of a typical large city an average of 12 000 acres
7077516 the first wave of abandoned properties due to foreclosure has probably landed but if we use the tsunami metaphor its the second and third waves that are larger and more dangerous says joe schilling professor of urban affairs and planning at virginia techs alexandria center
7077517 the best way to fight the tide he says is for each community and neighborhood to develop its own strategy based on the local economy and housing market schilling recommends that the redevelopment of large numbers of abandoned buildings happen in three phases first cities must stabilize neighborhoods by either demolishing vacant properties or acquiring them for redevelopment next officials must establish a plan that focuses on how to reclaim vacant properties at the neighborhood level finally cities must offer incentives perks such as tax credits or expedited permitting in order to lure back private developers and investors who would otherwise be disinterested
7077518 developer identified five cities that are putting such forward thinking plans into action these governments are working with the real estate community to turn around abandoned sites and offering incentives to entice developers to enter these troubled and neglected neighborhoods

7077526 that might all be true but who cares the job of a search engine is to reflect the consensus judgment of the web as a whole on a matter if most of the web view tiananmen as simply a symbol of democratic protests against authoritarian china then the fact that the chinese themselves see tiananmen differently as a symbol of more than 400 years of chinese history is irrelevant
7077527 theres no such thing as an objective search result and its a good thing too

7077540 cest tr s sympa davoir la pole sur ce nouveau circuit le trac nest pas sp cialement facile la surface est surtout un peu glissante et r aliser un tour parfait est donc toujours difficile mon premier secteur a t fantastique puis jai commis de toutes petites erreurs dans le 2 la voiture y est toujours un peu sous vireuse ou survireuse selon les virages et jai accompli un bon secteur 3 en fait tout sest jou le secteur 1 jai fait un bon tour en q3 ce que je navais pu faire en q2 cause du trafic en q3 je suis parvenu bien faire monter les pneus de la bonne fa on en temp rature et je n tais derri re personne je m me pass fernando dans mon tour de pr paration pour tre s r que jaurais un tour propre ma premi re tentative avait d j t bonne et jai am lior un peu dans la seconde
7077541 a sest bien pass pour nous nous savions depuis les essais que nous avions une bonne voiture en q1 et q2 la voiture tait super je suis rest en pneus tr s tendre pour mes deux runs en q3 mon premier tour na pas t g nial mais jai t plus content de mon second il y a toujours du temps gagner quelque part mais cest une bonne position de d part comme felipe massa la dit le secteur 1 tait d terminant et cest l quil a d truit tout le monde
7077542 ce fut une tr s bonne s ance de qualifications pour l quipe et pour moi
7077543 ce nest pas la quatri me place que je recherchais mais ce nest certainement pas la fin du monde
7077544 l quilibre de la voiture tait bon et nous nous sommes am lior s constamment tout au long des sessions
7077545 cest mon meilleur r sultat donc je suis heureux a ma pris un peu de temps pour am liorer mon ancien r sultat 7e lors de mon premier gp
7077546 apr s nos essais difficiles vendredi nous avons compl tement chang mon set up pour aujourdhui cependant nous avons eu un probl me de pompe huile de bo te de vitesses ce matin et de ce fait je nai pu lessayer jai donc attaquer la qualification en aveugle et jai utilis mon exp rience je me suis concentr tr s fort et je suis pass en q3 jai commis une erreur dans mon dernier run mais je reste tr s content de ce que jai accompli je suis aussi ravi de la fa on dont nous d veloppons la voiture ce qui nous permet de lutter pour le top 10 et les points a sera encore notre objectif dimanche
7077547 etre qualifi en 8 me position n est pas parfait mais je pense que c tait le maximum possible aujourd hui car la charge de carburant rentre en jeu
7077548 cela faisait quelques courses que nous n tions pas parvenus entrer dans le top10 donc cest un tr s bon r sultat pour nous nous voudrions videmment toujours faire mieux mais ceci montre que nous avons fait un pas dans la bonne direction et cest satisfaisant nous avons un meilleur arrangement do notre am lioration donc nous avons apport ces modifications qui nous ont donn une voiture plus concurrentielle aujourdhui nous avons une bonne strat gie pour la course et quelque chose est possible aujourdhui cela a t positif et cela me donne lespoir de marquer des points demain
7077549 je suis forc ment d u l issue de cette qualification car j avais d autres ambitions aujourd hui
7077550 je ne sais pas ce qui est arriv de mauvais mais je ne suis tout simplement pas parvenu faire un tour correct en q2
7077551 nous nous sommes d battus tout le week end pour trouver de la vitesse lendroit est nouveau ce qui apporte son lot dinconnues mais nous ne paraissons plus avoir le rythme dil y a quelques courses quelques tours mont satisfait mais il ny avait pas de quoi passer en q3
7077552 je suis d u de ma qualification j aurais sans doute pu faire un meilleur temps cet apr s midi
7077553 c tait une qualification vraiment d cevante aujourdhui car nous avons t rapides tout le week end
7077554 je pensais tre capable de passer outre la q1 dans mon dernier run jai vir large au 5 et perdu 0 4 sec bien que jai repris 0 2 sec la perte sur lensemble du tour ne ma pas permis de passer le cap ce f t probablement ma s ance la plus brouillonne
7077555 j ai donn tout ce que j avais sur mon tour
7077556 c tait une journ e incroyablement frustrante pour nous aujourdhui
7077557 le premier relai tait bon la piste s am liorait et le niveau d adh rence augmentait apr s chaque tour lors du second relais j ai eu un bon tour except une petite erreur dans le virage 14 ou j ai perdu un peu de temps mais ce n tait toujours pas mauvais ensuite dans le dernier relais j ai eu quelques probl mes avec le trafic dans mon tour de sortie et je n ai pas pu monter correctement les pneus en temp rature et ils n taient donc pas pr ts pour les premiers virages et j ai bloqu les roues dans le premier c est pour cela que je n ai pas pu am liorer mon chrono ce qui est d cevant car le dernier tour est toujours le plus rapide je suis dernier sur la grille nous verrons demain comment les choses se passent
7077558 jarno trulli a fait un boulot fantastique car il na pas roul en libres 3 cause dun probl me de pompe huile de bo te de vitesses mais a ne la pas stopp et tous ses tours except le dernier en q3 ont t tr s bons pour timo glock la journ e na pas t aussi fructueuse que vendredi il tait dans le rythme en q1 mais pas en q2 nous devons tudier pourquoi apr s les averses nocturnes la piste tait redevenue verte ce matin mais la situation est claire du point de vue du choix des pneus le c t positif est que nous sommes en position de nous d fendre contre les al as de la safety car nous nous assurerons que les deux voitures ne seront pas prises dans la m me neutralisation
7077559 notre position l issue des qualifications est d cevante d autant que nous pensions avoir bien travaill hier et nos r sultats semblaient encourageants

7077584 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7077585 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7077586 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line

7077591 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
7077592 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
7077593 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
7077594 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense

7077602 neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
7077603 there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all
7077604 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
7077605 but god commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us

7077612 thread but it doesnt seem to be quite the same issue
7077613 argh screw this i rolled a 100 im just going to go afk
7077614 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7077615 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7077616 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7077617 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7077618 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7077619 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7077620 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7077621 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7077622 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7077623 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7077624 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7077625 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7077626 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7077627 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7077628 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7077629 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7077630 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7077631 as part of the budget process ending on beacon hill we will see a nice uptick of payments to us for seeing medicaid patients
7077632 its welcome and comes at a difficult period for all community hospitals trying to make ends meet and operate in the black
7077633 if we can have a year in which we can operate in the black financially and avoid having to reduce our labor force it will provide us a little bit of a cushion
7077634 in a 100 million budget 250 000 is not the answer to every question but it helps when we are scraping for every nickel and trying to support patients and provide the best care available
7077635 to get that amount is unexpected but nice given how hard we work to control costs and overtime costs
7077636 every extra amount of money is a battle suddenly to have a quarter of a million dollars come to us is a terrific help
7077637 then if we cannot as yet think alike in all things at least we may love alike herein we cannot possibly do amiss
7077638 keep your eyes on the crucifix for jesus without the cross is a man without a mission and the cross without jesus is a burden without a reliever

7077645 merited for us justification by his most holy passion the instrumental cause is the sacrament of baptism
7077646 1 vatican ii 1962 65 reconfirms all of trent 2 and reiterates the necessity of baptism for salvation 3 as does the universal catechism of the catholic church baptism is necessary for salvation the church does not know of any other means that assures entry into eternal beatitude the merit of jesus christ is applied to infants by the sacrament of baptism the guilt of original sin is remitted
7077647 and are thereby members of the one true catholic church
7077648 t he holy ghost fell on all them which heard and obviously understood and believed the word
7077649 1 cor 1 21 see also jn 3 16 18 36 5 24 acts 10 43 13 38 39 16 31 rom 1 16 3 28 4 24 5 1 1 cor 15 1 4 eph 2 8 etc
7077650 mt 21 25 mk 11 30 acts 19 3 etc
7077651 mk 1 4 lk 3 3 acts 19 4 etc the baptism attributed to christ before the cross
7077652 did the baptizing jn 4 1 2 3 22 the baptism christ had to endure of suffering and death
7077653 lk 12 50 mt 20 22 mk 10 38 etc
7077654 rom 6 4 col 2 12 and the baptism by the holy spirit into the church the one body of christ 1 cor 12 13
7077655 that paul is not speaking of water baptism however but of the spiritual reality it symbolizes is clear for he says that through baptism
7077656 it true or live the new life by faith we would automatically never sin again
7077657 or symbolization of a spiritual baptism into christ effected by the holy spirit and which is settled forever in heaven but which must be lived out by faith while we are here upon earth
7077658 it was obviously this figure of old testament ceremonial cleansing which peter communicated to his jewish audience in his pentecost sermon
7077659 t he gospel of christ is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth it

7077670 in full disclosure i wrote that bill im not being facetious
7077671 no no im not being facetious im not being facetious when i say that
7077672 biden failed to reap the benefits of public confession even though he called himself stupid and his actions a mistake part of the problem is that he contradicted himself by also insisting that it was ludicrous to attribute every political idea

7077687 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
7077688 biden admits plagiarism in school but says it was not malevolent

7077690 mirror mirror on the wall whos the most liberal of them all
7077691 as most of you know i am not a president
7077692 the other day i was reading newsweek magazine and came across some poll data i found it must be true given the source right the newsweek poll alleges that 67 percent of americans are unhappy with the direction the country is headed and 69 percent of the country is unhappy with the performance of the president in essence 2 3 of the citizenry just aint happy and want a change so being the knuckle dragger i am i started thinking what are we so unhappy about a is it that we have electricity and running water 24 hours a day 7 days a week b is our unhappiness the result of having air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter 4 percent of these unhappy folks have a job d maybe it is the ability to walk into a grocery store at any time and see more food in moments than darfur has seen in the last year e maybe it is the ability to drive our cars and trucks from the pacific ocean to the atlantic ocean without having to present identification papers as we move through each state f or possibly the hundreds of clean and safe motels we would find along the way that can provide temporary shelter g i guess having thousands of restaurants with varying cuisine from around the world is just not good enough either h or could it be that when we wreck our car emergency workers show up and provide services to help all and even send a helicopter to take you to the hospital i perhaps you are one of the 70 percent of americans who own a home j you may be upset with knowing that in the unfortunate case of a fire a group of trained firefighters will appear in moments and use top notch equipment to extinguish the flames thus saving you your family and your belongings k or if while at home watching one of your many flat screen tvs a burglar or prowler intrudes an officer equipped with a gun and a bullet proof vest will come to defend you and your family against attack or loss l this all in the backdrop of a neighborhood free of bombs or militias raping and pillaging the residents neighborhoods where 90 of teenagers own cell phones and computers m how about the complete religious social and political freedoms we enjoy that are the envy of everyone in the world maybe that is what has 67 of you folks unhappy fact is we are the largest group of ungrateful spoiled brats the world has ever seen no wonder the world loves the u s yet has a great disdain for its citizens they see us for what we are the most blessed people in the world who do nothing but complain about what we dont have and what we hate about the country instead of thanking the good lord we live here what about the president who took us into war and has no plan to get us out the president who has a measly 31 percent approval rating is this the same president who guided the nation in the dark days after 9 11 the president that cut taxes to bring an economy out of recession could this be the same guy who has been called every name in the book for succeeding in keeping all the spoiled ungrateful brats safe from terrorist attacks the commander in chief of an all volunteer army that is out there defending you and me did you hear how bad the president is on the news or talk show did this news affect you so much make you so unhappy you couldnt take a look around for yourself and see all the good things and be glad think about it are you upset at the president because he actually caused you personal pain or is it because the media told you he was failing tokiss your sorry ungrateful behind every day the troops in iraq and afghanistan have volunteered to serve and in many cases may have died for your freedom there is currently no draft in this country they didnt have to go they are able to refuse to go and end up with either a general discharge an other than honorable discharge or worst case scenario a dishonorable
7077693 are we sure this is a good time to take god out of the pledge of allegiance
7077694 i was the only one in the family who could do that
7077695 ask the economists i think i only got a b minus in economics
7077696 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
7077697 i ts obviously not a good thing that these quotes are out there im just saying they could be much much worse given that biden and obama were rivals for the presidency just a few months ago
7077698 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7077699 when i said this mccain opposed bushs tax policies didnt plan to keep u s troops in iraq for 100 years wanted the republican party platform to be less extreme on abortion rights supported affirmative action and rejected the religious right mccain has since reversed course on all of those issues i liked the old mccain a lot better than the new one
7077700 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7077701 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia

7077704 weve brought back more international medals this quadrennial than ever before even during the greg louganis era
7077705 i came to beijing to get gold and i am so happy i have done that
7077706 i was disappointed to get an individual bronze so when i pumped my fist at the end that was a lot of frustration being released
7077707 we were happy to wear those new vests in the final the red brought us luck
7077708 but we wanted to end on a high moment the red vests gave us a new attitude it was good it worked out
7077709 its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
7077710 its not fair to compare all done their parts of history
7077711 its impossible everyone has made their own effort theyve achieved targets which are very tough to achieve in their own sports
7077712 to run is very easy to win is very tough
7077713 running is easy to win a gold medal is not
7077714 for me to reach this stage at such age is a bigger achievement than to have three gold medals
7077715 i dont know its not just my decision but its the decision also of the country
7077716 unless theres somebody that can come along and replace me at the 5 000 and the 10 000 i will have to stay on and continue to win the major medals
7077717 maybe after there is somebody who is good enough to step up maybe then i can move to the marathon
7077718 after seeing me lose the 5 000 in athens they were very upset for me
7077719 here they expected me to win the 5 000 they prayed for me they had hope for me so now it happened according to their plan and also my ambitions
7077720 the best jumps you dont think you just do them
7077721 it was a long competition and i got tired at the end all year everybody asks me about beijing the headlines will you win gold you get tired
7077722 its not fair to compare all done their parts of history
7077723 its impossible everyone has made their own effort theyve achieved targets which are very tough to achieve in their own sports

7077729 after seeing me lose the 5 000 in athens they were very upset for me
7077730 what the hell was he doing in the attic on your wedding night
7077731 do you finally fucking get it do you see what i see do you see what is happening
7077732 the best jumps you dont think you just do them
7077733 at the end all year everybody asks me about beijing the headlines will you win gold you get tired
7077734 you made a lot of chinese have their dreams broken
7077735 everyone from the outside would talk about my unstable psychological state
7077736 every time they talk about these short points i felt a psychological stinging
7077737 you can only see one color national flag raised to the roof
7077738 this is perfect ending for chinese national table tennis team
7077739 every time i won a silver medal i thought i was closer to the target because of the pain i withstood in the past i could harvest great joy today
7077740 i believe in terms of myself and ma our play was level
7077741 the only thing i did not do so well i did not control some of the critical points in a subtle way
7077742 i think you have your own dream you have not yet realized
7077743 hard to say hell i dont know i like my fake tits suck shirt a lot just due to sweet irony when i wear it

7077752 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
7077753 we should get on with this because quite frankly we are using stone age technology here we know we can do better we just need to agree the process by which we roll it out

7077796 das ergebnis geht in ordnung wir haben erneut gezeigt dass wir nicht so leicht zu bezwingen sind
7077797 leverkusen war wesentlich zweikampfst rker wir waren nicht pr sent aggressiv genug au erdem haben wir unsere torchancen nicht gemacht der sieg von leverkusen geht v llig in ordnung
7077798 wir haben in der ersten h lfte nicht so gut gespielt wie wir das eigentlich k nnen deshalb war die f hrung zur halbzeit auch etwas schmeichelhaft nach der pause haben wir dann richtig stark gespielt und am ende hochverdient gewonnen
7077799 por gl ria militar esse arco ris atraente que se levanta em chuvas de sangue

7077811 how do tom cruise s adopted children feel about all the media focus on his biological daughter suri
7077812 tom is a very good father and treats all three of his children exactly the same
7077813 we had good possession in the first half but we never took advantage of our chances
7077814 aberdeen scored on halftime and that gave them a massive lift there was little between the sides after the break we never quite had that continuity today thatll come
7077815 its early in the season and theres good signs there
7077816 weve been hearing that the old firm get all the decisions
7077817 it was incredible though hes in line with the play and from my own point of view it should have stood
7077818 we played very well in the opening period of the game we were lively and very active
7077819 after the sending off we sat back a little therefore im not happy with the way we played
7077820 senhora n s vamos estar registrando a sua reclama o
7077821 preocupaci n por la econom a en los pa ses industrializados y el debilitamiento del d lar frente a otras monedas
7077822 la mayor a de los crudos marcadores aumentaron con respecto a la semana anterior
7077823 desarrollo de la tormenta tropical fay en la costa del golfo de m xico
7077824 preocupaci n por la econom a en los pa ses industrializados el debilitamiento del d lar frente a otras monedas y el incremento de las tensiones geopol ticas
7077825 nuestra campa a se sostendr exclusivamente con el dinero recaudado por las ventas de los bonos y las contribuciones de toda nuestra militancia queremos recordar que somos un partido integrado por casi seis millones de personas las cuales con sus aportes solidarios y revolucionarios sostienen la campa a
7077826 estamos haciendo una campa a austera basada en la presencia de nuestros candidatos en contacto con el pueblo quienes han empapelado los postes de luz y las paredes de propaganda no es precisamente el psuv
7077827 i remember getting a call from the er fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull it and they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse
7077828 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7077829 he was detained because he was believed to be a security risk
7077830 he was released when after review he was determined not to pose a threat
7077831 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7077832 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
7077833 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7077834 its their sport and theyre gonna run it the way they see fit
7077835 they were trying to save what theyd worked their ass off to get
7077836 you could run a 500 cubic inch motor and it would check at 358 or whatever they wanted
7077837 old 421 the road junior used to run with a 180 gallon load aboard propelled by a 454 cadillac engine with two four barrel carburetors all neatly packaged in a 39 ford coupe the best chassis ever built and modified for hauling moonshine down out of these brushy mountains just east of the blue ridge
7077838 es w re gut f r den baseball wie f r alle sportarten wenn die stars dabei w ren
7077839 man muss den klaren willen haben zu helfen und dabei aber das bewusstsein dass nicht immer alles eitel wonne ist
7077840 man muss den leuten klar machen dass nicht immer alles gut ausgehen kann es gibt situationen im beruf des rettungssanit ters da geht einfach nichts mehr
7077841 je mehr erfahrung und routine man hat desto leichter kommt man damit klar aber es gibt f lle die vergisst man nie etwa den wiederbelebungsversuch an einem baby
7077842 man muss die dinge ablegen k nnen bevor man nach hause geht man muss mit schwierigen psychischen situationen umgehen k nnen oder sich helfen lassen
7077843 ich habe bis jetzt mit krankentransporten und nur leichteren unf llen zu tun gehabt
7077844 da baut man vieles ab man merkt sich aber schon auch die positiven erlebnisse wenn etwas gut verlaufen ist und man wirklich helfen konnte
7077845 ein gro teil sind krankentransporte man f hrt die patienten von punkt a nach punkt b und dann wieder zur ck manchmal kommt man dem patienten nur ein bisschen zu sp t obwohl eigentlich gar kein genauer termin vereinbart war und man wird schon angepflaumt passiert einem das um zwei uhr in der fr h und man soll noch immer gleich h flich sein wie bei einem freundlichen patienten den man um zw lf uhr zu mittag transportiert wird es mit der h flichkeit schon etwas schwieriger

7077847 osullivan 29 has never started a regular season nfl game
7077848 we start every series well we always win the first game and then we mess the next four up
7077849 the key to tonights win is to make sure we focus on tuesday and turn up with the same energy and same buzz i am captain who wants my players to be confident and play without fear and do a proper decent job thats what i do all my life i have been doing that and i think it is rubbing off on some of the lads
7077850 things are working at the moment and it is down to the way the guys have reacted over the last two weeks it was a real turn up for the books that michael did what he did but that was right for michael
7077851 but it is hats off to the lads they have shown such energy and passion the dressing room is such a happy place and that is because we are winning
7077852 there are areas we need to work on and there are some real positives happening in english cricket at the moment
7077853 i could not have asked for more from steve my relationship with him is as strong as anything and he is a happy happy man he is a superstar as well this is the stage he belongs on
7077854 steve wants to play for england and play on the bigger stage and that is where he is performing at the moment
7077855 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7077856 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7077857 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7077858 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7077859 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7077860 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement

7077862 man muss zuerst einmal vom bildungsminister benannt werden dann kommt es zu einer selektion und zu einem hearing und schlie lich m ssen dann noch alle 27 staaten der europ ischen union zustimmen
7077863 ich sehe es als tolle herausforderung im internationalen bereich t tig zu sein und erwarte mir eine spannende t tigkeit
7077864 es wird sicherlich auch viel arbeit mit den eltern geben
7077865 nach zwei jahren werde ich aber evaluiert genauso wie die lehrer dieser schule die vertr ge auf neun jahre bekommen aber auch das erste mal nach zwei jahren evaluiert werden wenn die arbeit nicht passt dann m ssen sie gehen

7077871 when you gotta pay two thousand dollars for a limousing for four days seven dollars to park and two dollars and fifty cents to check your coat at a time when most people in this country just cant hack it thats ostentatious

7077881 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7077882 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7077883 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7077884 we are discussing various combinations at the moment and would like to be pretty flexible we will take it game by game

7077994 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7077995 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7077996 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means

7078001 from back in the day when they could sacrifice fun for interesting mechanics
7078002 we have daily crosscurrents from the financial sector where one day there is widespread concern that the credit crisis is getting worse and the next day its getting better
7078003 falling oil prices is the best thing that can happen to the stock market
7078004 good for all kinds of stocks because people have a little more money for spending on apparel or television sets or at the supermarket
7078005 i think that the growing likelihood that the treasury and perhaps federal reserve will have to move vigorously to prop up fannie and freddie has the market and investors on edge
7078006 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7078007 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7078008 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7078009 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7078010 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7078011 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7078012 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations

7078017 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7078018 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7078019 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7078020 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
7078021 saturday is a big start for me and the team not to make amends
7078022 thats not the main goal right here the main goal right here is to pitch and win games for this team and thats the way im going to go about it one start at a time and ill assess everything when the seasons over whenever that is

7078025 the port of tulsa cant use the port of houston the port of pittsburgh cant use any other port but new orleans its not the port of new orleans its all the cities that new orleans makes into ports
7078026 one half of all the sediment that is lost is actually sitting behind dams in nd amp sd dams built to provide electricity

7078030 you were doing rather well up until that last part

7078034 then one of you gets to take my place triage ladies and gentlemen green means theyre fine yellow means theyll be fine red means treat now and black means if they arent dead now they will be soon have fun kids

7078039 it will be the toughest race ever as there will be many challenges the contestants will not expect and be mentally prepared for the teams will have shorter resting time the journey will be harder and the speed of the race will be faster and more intense this combined with the new cast you can expect many dramatic moments tears twists and turns and an overall thrilling ride for viewers
7078040 the amazing race asia is a mega production and we have only been able to create this world world class production because of the faith of our valuable partners many like sony electronics asia pacific caltex nokia and standard chartered bank are long time supporters of asian franchise and we are proud to bring in our new partners singha corporation and maskargo to the race

7078042 happy to announce that zardari had accepted his partys nomination
7078043 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
7078044 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7078045 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
7078046 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
7078047 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
7078048 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7078049 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7078050 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7078051 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7078052 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7078053 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7078054 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7078055 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

7078057 zardari has accepted the pakistan peoples partys unanimous drafting of him and he will be the candidate of the pakistan peoples party
7078058 it should be someone who is a national figure has national stature and is non partisan

7078088 having my 3 sisters are like having each a best friend you cant get rid of you know whatever you do theyll still be there
7078089 we had too many procedure penalties too many snaps on the ground and too many missed tackles
7078090 our tempo needs to improve and overall our kickers and punters did not have a very good day i was disappointed in their performance and it hurt our ability to evaluate some of our return people
7078091 we played a lot of younger kids but thats no excuse
7078092 i didnt see a thing i liked we didnt give a great effort we didnt give great focus we didnt pay attention to detail we didnt tackle we werent mentally tough we didnt do anything that a great defensive team would do to win football games the only good news is we didnt play a real game today it was brutal as bad as ive ever seen it
7078093 i love your site if i ever talk to anyone who has finished a book ill definitely recommend sending it to you thanks again for all your work in getting epitaph ready

7078101 s un gran grup de jugadors i persones que ho han donat tot i no shi pot fer m s
7078102 no hem guanyat i no shi pot fer m s ja ho vaig dir despr s de la semifinal aquest s un gran grup de jugadors i de persones ho han donat tot un equip que ha jugat tan ofensiu com espanya ha tingut dos partits amb resultats de futbol i aix no s normal en hoquei

7078104 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace
7078105 we need time to grasp that we really won the gold medal
7078106 we didnt have the best before and i hope now we do
7078107 theyre mentally tough they dont give up they continue to play hard which we knew it was a great game for us because we played well had a big lead the hardest thing about giving up a big lead is to then push it out again which we were able to do i think that shows what jerry colangelo has been trying to do for the last three years is build a team because when you have a team that is that tight and that close and plays so well together then you are able to withstand huge runs from a great team like argentina
7078108 its no secret what our strength is pressure defense well worry about us instead of worrying about them
7078109 im very happy for him im proud of him it should be a fun game on sunday
7078110 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7078111 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7078112 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7078113 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7078114 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7078115 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7078116 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today
7078117 then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out
7078118 so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3
7078119 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today
7078120 im delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top 10 and score points that is again our target tomorrow
7078121 its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race
7078122 here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7078123 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that
7078124 we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end
7078125 for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today
7078126 i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out
7078127 of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow
7078128 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions
7078129 however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum
7078130 its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid
7078131 our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7078132 today we saw another very good afternoons work from both lewis and heikki characterised by strong lap times that reflect their respective race strategies
7078133 all in all therefore were well prepared for the first grand prix to be held on this exciting new race track
7078134 all the drivers did an exemplary job today in fact avoiding the walls in the tricky conditions
7078135 we hope that tomorrows race will be equally incident free

7078159 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7078160 its a well intended notion he has but its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7078161 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
7078162 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7078163 yeah get it over with it will suck for the first few years but after a while theyll help entertain each other
7078164 its not nearly as bad as people said it would be not bad at all
7078165 i dont like the way fred talked to me at the office
7078166 sabia que era a primeira e a ltima vez que eu poderia jogar esta competi o nosso objetivo era o ouro e conquist lo significa tudo
7078167 fomos muito bem ficamos muito tempo juntos s vezes sent amos muitas dificuldades mas muitas vezes vale a pena fazer um esfor o t o grande
7078168 o jogo foi muito duro por causa do calor pelo hor rio s 12h em pequim mas sab amos que n o poder amos perder a partida e por sorte conseguimos a vit ria

7078170 he has tended his resignation to us within the past month
7078171 he is under contract until the end of october and has got other opportunities
7078172 im a big giant pussy and i cant handle the taste of regular beer
7078173 i want to drink a smirinoff ice but im too much of a douche to admit it
7078174 during the season at the waratahs i was sort of getting switched around and became a utility player which i hated at the time but ive found my position now so im happy
7078175 i talked about it with ewen mckenzie playing 12 and he said im more of a 13 and a winger so i went on es hunch and it didnt really suit the way i played
7078176 robbie gave me a second chance to prove myself playing at 12 as well
7078177 to get a second chance and play consistently in the australia a side sort of gave me an opportunity to get into the wallabies
7078178 its up to chris hickey at the end of the day hopefully he does see me as a 12
7078179 as soon as robbie said he wanted me to play 12 it was another challenge for me to see how good it was and it was
7078180 it was a position that suits my style of game you get in early with the ball a lot more tackling so im happy what im doing now
7078181 in rugby league you sort of sit on a channel on the left side where i used to play you sit there and whatever the halfback and five eighth said was religious
7078182 i am not thinking of next year now and will not until the end of the season
7078183 i am not talking to anyone now at all i am fully focussed on this years championship and i am not worried about next year
7078184 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
7078185 i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team
7078186 i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
7078187 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
7078188 im not worried in a way its good the team are talking to someone like alonso who has a lot of experience and with good teams
7078189 they are going to talk to other drivers thats only natural but im very happy with my position within the team rubens is a team mate i think he is fantastic has done a great job and he gives excellent feedback probably better than any other driver out there

7078195 we havent worked hard enough on how the referees are reffing the game and thats where weve really fallen down
7078196 it seems to be about how theyre reffing the game not about the game
7078197 we really havent challenged penalty counts and challenged that side of he game and thats where i think ive fallen down i didnt do much of it in pre season didnt work on it hard enough about their calls about being able to put three in a tackle and roll off and take heaps of time on the ground
7078198 if some part of its off you get penalised and were really poor there thats something we have to work really hard on as of tomorrow
7078199 it didnt take away the fact they were always going to beat us they wanted to beat us they wanted it more
7078200 we dont give ourselves a fair chance my attention to detail was pretty poor
7078201 our goal was to move into the last two games with a performance that was improving moving into a bigger and more important part of the season
7078202 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7078203 of course we watched it as closely as we did anything that was on our radar screen
7078204 for example all new residential units could have a free public transit pass for a year built into the selling price
7078205 at a new development of 250 apartments in floridorf vienna the developers provided only 25 car parking spaces all of which were dedicated to car clubs
7078206 each new tenant was offered a years free membership to the scheme and 57 per cent took up the offer the reduction in parking saved the developer 9 per cent of the total construction budget
7078207 at the moment when you put something like the brisbane south east busway in the private sector gets an additional profit for doing nothing
7078208 blood drinking and blood letting are always symbolic into the literal
7078209 i trust you and i place my life within your hands
7078210 were pretty much aware of that and even last weekend in perth against fremantle you saw his capacity to continually bob up to be able to read the ball and be in space
7078211 i cant adjust whatever emotion st kilda is going through and i wont waste my time on it
7078212 what we will do as a club is recognise roberts contribution to the game but well focus on what we need to do and what gets the best results for us
7078213 weve been coming up against some good forwards but i think the way were playing as a defensive six were ready for a challenge like that
7078214 it will be a team responsibility as to how we handle riewoldt but i think were more than ready for it
7078215 i think us having a bit more height this time with both myself and nathan bock available will also help
7078216 he mentions to me every week without fail theres no substitute for hard work and its something thats rubbed off on a lot of the guys hes played with
7078217 we didnt get a penalty probably from the 35th minute mark and i didnt see much of a change in the tempo of the game the way we were playing
7078218 we sit there and watch and go through the heartbreak but theyre the ones feeling the pain and when you lose like that the pain is a lot worse
7078219 im just happy to get the two points i would have been happy to take one point
7078220 the thing i liked about tonight was the way a lot of little things clicked for us and certain players
7078221 david stagg was back doing all the little things he hasnt been doing for a little while ashton sims had his best running game and ben hannant was streets above where he has been for a couple of weeks
7078222 i saw a whole lot of little things with different players to give me a bit of confidence going forward
7078223 but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
7078224 this is 23 its the harmon kids shooting squirrels again
7078225 copy that 23 does their father know they are shooting their guns in town
7078226 oh its the harmon kids and their dad shootin at squirrels

7078233 well spend a bit more time on him because hes been in red hot form and whoever goes to him will have a tough job to do for the team on the day to try and quell his influence
7078234 hes kicking goals setting up goals and getting possessions so hes obviously one weve got to try and stop
7078235 hes a great team player a workhorse hes invaluable to our side so im sure our boys will try to get over the line as we try to do for most milestone games
7078236 you only have to look at his preliminary final his effort got us into the grand final

7078239 the public will rightly ask how this government can claim to be taking data security seriously when the number of breaches at the revenue has actually increased following the lost discs fiasco
7078240 it is particularly disappointing that the hmrc breaches have not prevented other unacceptable security breaches from occurring
7078241 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7078242 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

7078253 ahmadinejads mother is a jew and from the establishment of islamic republic in 1979 the crypto jews were in the highest position in decision making in the state
7078254 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran
7078255 proved to everyone that iran of today is an iran that is impossible to live with ahmadinejad unites the entire world against iran
7078256 i really dont like either team but i definitely dont like fsu so id have to say miami

7078258 the motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved but rather on the way they are put together for example the square and the circle have many properties in common they are both one dimensional objects from a topological point of view and both separate the plane into two parts the part inside and the part outside

7078279 theres one thing i hate about this sport is that the judges can control peoples lives and can take points away and they can do whatever they want

7078281 they feel they have to because of what they see theyre influenced
7078282 biden referred three times to iowas junior senator as tom harkins
7078283 one of the catalysts for the team was that the new superintendent former fbi special agent jody weis is very big on fitness
7078284 it was a big topic around the station about finding time to work out between our regular work schedule going to court on days off family commitments and other things and we wanted to show it could be done
7078285 after last years race i went back to the office and a lot of folks asked questions about the sport
7078286 theyd wanted to do something like that but didnt have the time or didnt have someone to train with
7078287 then al sent out the e mail this year saying we have this challenge and would people be interested in training together and that was the attraction for me that wed push each other
7078288 we might formalize it next year and raise money for fallen officers funds for both agencies
7078289 but since the cpd is headed by a former special agent of the fbi i think bragging rights will go a long way
7078290 i wore the jersey last fall at a half ironman and people were constantly yelling go cpd
7078291 said aaron the fbi jerseys with the chicago skyline and fbi 100th anniversary logo will debut on sunday and should also be easy to spot

7078308 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq

7078310 i think i have a much higher iq than you do

7078355 they provide eight hours of moving image excerpts supported by online curriculum materials that present balanced historical background information an analysis of the actual language and ramifications of the treaty articles alongside wide ranging footage that gives evidence of the changing dynamic of the treaty in new zealands recent history there is plenty of room for teachers to manoeuvre and for students to see the contentious issues being debated
7078356 at one point you might be analysing the divergent views of those involved in the representation of the treaty during the final stages of te papas construction next a news report on the use of the haka in a video game this exceptional footage is designed to show the treaty in its many aspects at work in new zealand society
7078357 the idea is to make it both informed and enjoyable and as the new curriculum says make what we study a part of our life long learning it doesnt stipulate what viewpoint you should take but it does provide the source evidence of the different perceptions people have had regarding this important and contentious document over time

7078429 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7078430 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7078431 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7078446 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7078447 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7078448 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7078454 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7078455 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7078456 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7078457 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7078458 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7078459 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7078460 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7078461 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7078462 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7078463 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7078464 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7078465 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7078466 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7078467 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7078468 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7078469 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7078496 this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional

7078516 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7078517 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7078518 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7078519 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

7078526 het thema van de vrouwenagenda is nog nooit zo toepasselijk geweest als dit jaar
7078527 het was een kluts van emoties toen tejo en ik in oktober in de auto stapten bij het dekenaat de dag dat we hoorden dat we ontslagen zouden worden zei ik tegen hem ik ben ont zet tend kwaad maar ik had ook een groot gevoel van machteloosheid niet gewaardeerd te worden ik heb me heel erg in de steek gelaten gevoeld door mijn eigen kerk ik kreeg een grote strijdlust over me een ontslag dat laat je toch niet gebeuren daarom heb ik een advocaat in de arm genomen voor mijn gevoel je laat je niet zomaar aan de kant zetten het heeft me veel geld gekost maar ik zou het z weer doen de dag van de uitspraak had ik een heel gelaten houding zoek t allemaal maar uit ik had er rekening mee gehouden dat we zouden verliezen het kwam niet als een verrassing ik was toen ook al gewend aan het idee dat ik weg zou gaan
7078528 titus haar man ol zegt dat ik regelmatig stralend uit mijn werk kom het team waarmee ik werk is leuk er is een goeie sfeer bij de schinkel ga ik trainingen geven aan vrijwilligers in
7078529 bijzondere vieringen of eigenlijk vond ik elke viering wel iets bijzonders het geeft een kick als een viering goed gaat maar het draait niet om mij als ik voorga zie ik mezelf als doorgeefluik er is namelijk meer aan de hand dan alleen marieke milder
7078530 ik was onder de indruk van de mooie toespraken en van het boekje
7078531 nu ik een halve baan heb bij de schinkel heb ik nog een dag beschikbaar om voor de eug te werken het is aan de eug om te beslissen in welke mate ze daarvan gebruik wil maken maar er kan nog wel wat bij
7078532 ik zei het al in mijn afscheidsspeech het is moeilijk om mensen te vinden die tijd en energie willen steken in de eug
7078533 in the name of jesus i come against thou devil of blindness of lameness evil spirits of infirmity i charge you now come out of their bodies
7078534 the public do have a right to be unhappy we never go out to lose but weve got a new playing style and i think the public needs to patient rome wasnt built in a day
7078535 we have to start executing correctly im not unhappy about today we just werent accurate enough and we are really getting there where we want to be
7078536 the laws changed in the super 14 and we were caught fast asleep we had to change our game and become quicker and more intense
7078537 when you dont win thats usually when you do some soul searching i think some players were flat today and if you look at the amount of rugby theyve played this year i can understand why some players have played every minute of the super 14 and then in tests for us
7078538 its a bad position to be in and we cant go wholesale we will see if we can play these players into the ground next week and get that win
7078539 we did turn over ball and so did they i think it was a helluva improvement on last week there were one or two times when our body positions werent right but it was far better than perth when they took a lot of ball away from us
7078540 we will see if we can play these players into the ground next week and get that win

7078544 the drinking age is not to blame for the culture of binge drinking
7078545 abusive drinking has been a problem at colleges for years remember animal house
7078546 a disengaged laxness will not help young people come to grapple with self indulgent individualism
7078547 i would not support the lowering of the drinking age because it is a deterrent for most underage individuals
7078548 why arent you putting this out on dvd in america people like it there are anglophiles there
7078549 im sure ive been in this house before i came to a party on this road
7078550 you came to this house you came to our house thirty years ago
7078551 run into the house and get the camera nobody will ever believe this if we dont get a picture
7078552 recently ive seen kit fox tracks and weve had badgers just below us but you know for a long time something very strange has been going on here it began thirteen or fourteen years ago we heard a sound a loud shrill sound moving along the cliff behind us but it was so dark we couldnt see anything it was a little like the call of a red tailed hawk but much too loud and not really the same it moved too fast across the cliff to be any animal with legs yet it was too slow to be a flying bird if itd been an animal with legs especially moving at that speed itd have knocked rocks loose and wed have heard them but not a single dislodged rock was heard
7078553 over the years weve experienced this sound on several occasions
7078554 last time it happened we had sense enough to go get the tape recorder as soon as it began but we had to go down to the hogan to get it and exactly when we turned the recorder on the sound ended as we were walking back to the house we stumbled over jason well finally it occurred to us that since jason was a very good watchdog and always barked hysterically at the least hint of anything out of the ordinary he should have been barking his head off but he just sat there wagging his tail and looking at us in a smiling way as if nothing had happened
7078555 two or three days later a couple of our young navajo friends came over for a visit and we told them laughingly about this mysterious sound the man said on the night you heard this sound thats the night when hite chee came back to his hogan and found that somebody had witched him somebody had taken a hatchet or knife and gone around and chopped notches on each of the big logs coming out of the ground holding up his hogans walls and there were hoofprints outside where somebody had ridden a horse around and around this couple suggested rather matter of factly that wed been hearing a skin walker the woman told us that skin walkers can tell dogs to be quiet
7078556 well skin walkers are evil spirits theyre people who have killed a relative and when theyre around regular people they bring very bad luck if you have an enemy you can hire a witch who will send a skin walker against your enemy youve noticed that the hogans have an open hole in their roofs the navajos believe that skin walkers climb up the outside walls of their hogans and watch them through those holes weve noticed that when the sun goes down the older navajos are inside their hogans or houses and thats where they stay until the sun rises
7078557 well you know all about st joseph and selling houses right

7078579 defence has been our strength the whole tournament and we just let them have 90 points thats not australian basketball
7078580 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7078581 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith
7078582 its such an accomplishment for this team for the u s for these girls im more than thrilled
7078583 but im the kind of a person to go down swinging thats how i am and i feel all right about it
7078584 ive got to go to my go to hitter that got us to this match
7078585 she took swings and they were just ready for her if theyre going to win this match theyve got to stop our best player
7078586 im very lucky to have this crowd show so much love to me especially since i have been off the court so long as a player

7078593 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7078594 we should make contributions to the country i understand we are a socialist family
7078595 when the distributor can not i pay up to u s 5 per cylinder
7078596 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7078597 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7078598 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7078599 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7078600 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7078601 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7078602 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

7078606 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
7078607 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war

7078616 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7078617 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7078618 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7078619 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7078620 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7078621 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7078622 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7078623 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7078624 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7078625 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7078626 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7078627 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7078628 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7078629 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

7078631 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7078632 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7078633 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7078634 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7078635 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7078636 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7078637 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7078638 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7078639 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7078640 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7078641 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7078642 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7078643 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7078644 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7078645 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7078646 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7078647 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7078648 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7078649 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7078650 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7078651 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7078652 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7078653 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7078654 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7078655 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7078656 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7078657 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7078658 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7078659 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7078660 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7078661 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7078662 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

7078665 fazer hist ria express o que se usa muito na cr nica esportiva deu uma banalizada
7078666 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7078667 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7078668 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7078669 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7078670 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7078671 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7078672 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7078673 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7078674 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7078675 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7078676 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7078677 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7078678 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7078679 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7078680 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7078681 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7078682 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7078683 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7078684 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7078685 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7078686 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7078687 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7078688 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7078689 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7078690 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7078691 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7078692 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7078693 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7078694 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7078695 sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7078696 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7078697 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7078698 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7078699 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in and end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7078700 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7078701 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7078702 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7078703 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7078704 we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7078705 zardari has accepted the pakistan peoples partys unanimous drafting of him and he will be the candidate of the pakistan peoples party
7078706 we came outside and we saw flames coming out of the house we went to look and it started exploding even more
7078707 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never boney boney but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
7078708 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating

7078728 when i first approached school back in 1990 when i was a freshman i was an athlete and i basically flunked out

7078732 el escaso r gimen de lluvias hace de libia un territorio rido ocupado por el desierto en el 90 de su extensi n
7078733 el proyecto del gran r o artifical es la infraestructura m s importante de transporte de agua de dulce obtenida del subsuelo del desierto para suministro de la poblaci n urbana y el regad o
7078734 en 1996 el proyecto logr suministrar agua dulce a la ciudad de tripoli el conjunto del proyecto supone una inversi n de hasta ahora 30 000 millones de d lares el sistema obtiene agua dulce de las cuatro cuencas subterr neas las tres primeras contienen unas reservas combinadas de 35 000 kil metros c bicos de agua
7078735 el norte del pa s tiene 1 770 km de costa mediterr nea en la que se concentra la mayor a de su poblaci n y es la zona del mayor desarrollo econ mico agr cola e industrial
7078736 libia carece de aguas superficiales y por eso sus principales proyectos de desarrollo han buscado el aprovechamiento de los acu feros subterr neos y el transporte del agua a zonas agr colas
7078737 la mayor parte de los cinco millones y medio de habitantes se concentra en la costa mediterr nea y cuenta con uno de los mayores desarrollos de frica esto ha hecho que desde 1951 a o de la independencia de libia haya multiplicado por cinco su poblaci n
7078738 libia ha visto en las ltimas d cadas c mo el desarrollo econ mico ha aumentado una poblaci n que se concentra en las reas urbanas del norte y cuya demanda de alimentos apenas es cubierta en un 25 por la producci n nacional
7078739 la pr xima semana libia firma un acuerdo con la uni n europa que abordar diferentes mbitos con el objetivo de atraer la inversi n extranjera directamente al pa s y diversificar as nuestra econom a
7078740 la mayor a de nuestra agua proviene de estas capas tenemos que desarrollar una estrategia para gestionar los recursos durante 25 a os con el objetivo de disminuir la extracci n de agua de estas capas y utilizar otro tipo de recursos como desalinizaci n o incluso estudiamos la importaci n de agua desde el extranjero
7078741 hemos construido desalinizadoras hacemos sondeos para localizar aguas en las capas fre ticas queremos obtener recursos h dricos para la agricultura y el uso dom stico en este campo contamos con poca colaboraci n con espa a por lo que pedimos que nos asistan para desarrollar nuestros recursos h dricos
7078742 el gobierno de libia aboga por el desarrollo de energ as alternativas nos estamos centrando en la energ a solar ya que tenemos un pa s c lido y hemos puesto muchas esperanzas en ello nos encaramos al futuro con creatividad y pasi n por descubrir nuevas cosas

7078756 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
7078757 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7078758 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7078759 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
7078760 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7078761 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
7078762 its the worst thing that could happen having to stop at the olympics
7078763 ive never stopped any race since i began even when i fell or broke something i always finish
7078764 here it was a physical problem i couldnt do anything else
7078765 i got in a little trouble in the corner i was stuck inside and could not get out at the end of the day i have to be happy with the finish and the 10 year process to get here
7078766 our team has worked so hard preparing for these games and to get this result here tells us that were finally there being one step up in ranking and beating the americans proves to us that our country has greatly improved
7078767 nee shine verder alsjeblieft ik weet zeker dat je knie n verder uit elkaar kunnen
7078768 controleer je opwinding en kijk goed in de spiegel of je tepels harder worden concentreer je erop dat dat niet mag beheersing van je gevoel schaamte en opwinding is het kernwoord dat weet je en je weet ook dat een orgasme is uitgesloten
7078769 laat n hand de binnenkant van je dijen strelen terwijl de andere op je hoofd blijft
7078770 nee nee ik wil je borsten nog beter kunnen zien trek je schouders nog verder naar achteren
7078771 streel nu langzaam langs de binnenzijde van je dijen in de richting van je schaamlippen probeer je vingers zo te bewegen dat de binnenkant van je dijen sterk gekieteld worden voel hoe je vingers opwinding teweegbrengen maar blijf er voortdurend aan denken dat je die niet mag tonen
7078772 laat nu je vingers tussen je schaamlippen glijden voel hoe glad en vochtig je bent en hoe warm je schaamlippen worden ga met een paar vingers in je kutje en probeer daar het meest gevoelige plekje te vinden
7078773 zorg ervoor je opwinding te laten toenemen zodat het steeds lastiger wordt je beheersing te onderdrukken
7078774 doorgaan shine gewoon doorgaan net zolang tot ik je zal zeggen dat je moet ophouden en je dijen geopend houden hoor ik weet zeker die nog wel wat verder uiteen kunnen
7078775 leg je hand maar even op je hoofd en denk er om dat ik de binnenkant van je dijen goed wil blijven zien hoor
7078776 je hebt me zeer teleurgesteld shine voor straf moet je jezelf vijf keer tussen je benen slaan
7078777 leg een hand tussen je dijen midden op je kutje en laat de andere op je hoofd liggen je telt hardop tot vijf bij de laatste tel sla je jezelf op je kutje
7078778 en shine elke seconde die je nu nog langer wacht betekent een slag meer en denk er om dat je hard genoeg slaat zorg ervoor dat je jezelf pijn doet heb je dat begrepen
7078779 je wacht te lang shine zes slagen nu en opschieten alsjeblieft en je dijen nog wat verder uit elkaar dat kan je best
7078780 zo gaat het niet meisje je moet harder slaan wat jij doet is geen straf het is meer een liefkozing van je kutje dat is niet de bedoeling de volgende drie slagen moeten veel harder zijn veel intenser je moet jezelf echt pijn doen ik moet aan je kunnen zien dat de slagen hard en gemeend zijn dat ze echt pijn doen je schaamlippen moeten vuurrood en dik worden je hebt nog drie slagen tegoed elke keer een korte felle tik en je hand harder laten neerkomen heb je dat begrepen
7078781 goed dan en denk er aan als ik na afloop je schaamlippen controleer zal ik aan de gevoeligheid ervan kunnen beoordelen of je de straf goed hebt uitgevoerd als ik niet tevreden ben ga ik je zelf straffen maar dan niet met mijn hand besef dan dat ik je veel harder zal slaan dan wanneer je het zelf doet en denk er steeds aan je knie n zover mogelijk gespreid te houden ik weet best dat je je daarvoor vreselijk schaamt maar dat is helemaal niet erg ga nu maar door en duidelijk hardop tellen alsjeblieft
7078782 doorgaan meisje en dijen gespreid houden hoe vaak moet ik dat nog zeggen nog twee slagen ik weet zeker dat je nog feller kunt
7078783 nog n meisje het gaat goed maar denk er om dat de laatste slag de hardste moet zijn je moet ervoor zorgen dat de laatste slag ook je clitoris vol raakt
7078784 blijf maar even zitten zo meisje leg je handen maar weer op je hoofd dan zal ik je even controleren kijken en voelen of je jezelf voldoende gestraft hebt
7078785 nu vraag ik je het niet meer nu draag ik je het op doe het
7078786 concentreer je gevoel in je vingertop probeer niet aan een orgasme te denken
7078787 voel de leegte in je kruis schreeuwend om die vinger voel hoe je tepel blij is met de aandacht
7078788 voel hoe je lichaam hunkert jouw lichaam hunkert naar jouw handen voel de twijfel het verlangen
7078789 je zal het straks wel zien vergeet haar maar gewoon ze is niet belangrijk voor ons op het moment
7078790 ehh dit overvalt me een beetje ik weet niet wat ik moet zeggen sterker nog ik weet niet wat ik er van moet denken
7078791 het is moeilijk uit te leggen en daarom heb ik dat ook niet vooraf gedaan vergeef me als ik je heb laten schrikken maar nogmaals ze is voor ons niet belangrijk beschouw haar gewoon als onze gastvrouw dat is het makkelijkste
7078792 nee ze doet dit vrijwillig en ik betaal haar niet
7078793 ik snap er geen barst van en vind het maar raar sterker nog ik begin te twijfelen of ik er wel goed aan heb gedaan om met je mee te komen
7078794 okay ik zal het je uitleggen maar onder een paar kleine voorwaarden
7078795 ten eerste geef je me de tijd om alles uit te leggen alles dus
7078796 ten tweede wat ik je vertel en laat zien blijft tussen ons
7078797 dat je straks je jas aan kunt trekken en weggaan wanneer je maar wilt
7078798 zoals ik al zei bianca is mijn onderdanige in ons taalgebruik is ze mijn sub en ik ben haar top sommigen zouden haar een slaaf noemen maar dat vind ik geen prettig woord
7078799 bianca breng de wijn hier naar toe en masseer daarna s haar nek ze is erg gespannen
7078800 nee jij kan haar niet kwetsen ze huilt omdat je mij hebt gekwetst
7078801 wil je me alsjeblieft uitleggen wat je bedoelt ik snap echt niet waar je naar toe wilt met dit hele gedoe
7078802 door op mij te vertrouwen en een stukje eigen wil in te leveren krijg je nu iets fijns
7078803 je hebt ondanks alles vertrouwen in mij zolang ik dat vertrouwen niet erg beschaam zal je af en toe de touwtjes van je leven los laten en ze in mijn handen geven
7078804 met bianca heb ik een zelfde relatie alleen gaan we daar verder
7078805 soms kan je wat je hebben wilt niet zelf bereiken daar heb je iemand anders voor nodig iemand die je helpt stuurt of stimuleert je moet daar een stukje vrijheid voor opgeven maar wat nu als hetgeen dat je hebben wilt wat extremer is dan gewoonlijk dan moet je meer opgeven dan alleen een klein beetje vrijheid
7078806 maar stel nou dat hetgeen je wilt bereiken het opgeven van vrijheid zelf is het loslaten totale overgave weerloosheid
7078807 bianca heeft haar vrijheid opgegeven om mij te dienen omdat ze weet dat ik haar kan helpen om te krijgen wat ze graag wil
7078808 genoeg nu straks meer geniet nog even van je massage
7078809 bedankt voor je vertrouwen ik was daarstraks even bang dat je gillend weg zou hollen
7078810 dat zou betekenen dat ik haar verwerp en dat zou het einde van onze relatie betekenen
7078811 waarom zou je me laten kiezen tussen een gebakje en een toetje als je ze allebei kan hebben ze zijn allebei lekker maar op een andere manier ze zitten elkaar niet in de weg
7078812 wat zou jij in een relatie kunnen en willen doen voor mij dat bianca niet kan of wil wat zou bianca voor mij kunnen doen dat jij niet kan of wil jij denkt dat het het ene of het andere is ik denk dat het samen naast elkaar kan bestaan
7078813 ik vind het eng en ik geloof dat ik het nog steeds niet helemaal snap waarom zou bianca zulke dingen voor jou doen waarom zou ik dat niet doen
7078814 omdat zij pijn kan omzetten in genot en jij niet
7078815 bedoel je dat ze kickt op pijn ik heb dat wel eens gelezen en op tv gezien
7078816 ze kickt op geestelijke pijn hoe denk je dat bianca zich nu voelt nu we zo over haar praten ze moet wel behoorlijk veel vertrouwen in me hebben om het zover te laten komen
7078817 ik geloof er geen reet van jij beweert dus dat bianca zich laat koeioneren door jou omdat ze daar een kick van krijgt volgens mij spelen jullie gewoon onder een hoedje met elkaar en lachen jullie je dadelijk helemaal rot als ik gillend weg ren
7078818 je begint het te snappen geloof ik ja haar geest had ik al die tijd al onder controle maar dat was voor jou moeilijk in te zien het laten aanbieden van haar lichaam is tastbaarder
7078819 wat betekent het concreet dat je vrijelijk over haar lichaam mag beschikken
7078820 bianca ik wil dat je jouw dienstbaarheid aan s toont
7078821 ze heeft jou nu toestemming gegeven om over haar lichaam te beschikken mits ik daar mee akkoord ga
7078822 niet echt maar je hoeft de toestemming niet te gebruiken als je wilt
7078823 dan blijft ze zitten want ze weet dat ik dat niet wil mijn stem is doorslaggevend
7078824 dat bianca dit wil kan ik ergens wel begrijpen maar wat drijft jou het gevoel van macht de seksuele kick in liefdadigheid geloof ik niet
7078825 hoe gaat dat allemaal in zijn werk dan gaat daar een soort voorspel aan vooraf hoe moet ik me dat voorstellen
7078826 wat zou jij vernederend vinden als jij haar plaats in zou moeten nemen
7078827 ik denk dat ik het heel erg zou vinden als je mij zou gebruiken als een soort bijzettafeltje en dan gemene spelletjes met me zou doen
7078828 ja ze heeft je toch de beschikking over haar lichaam gegeven doe het je zal zien dat ze je gehoorzaamt
7078829 onwennig kijk ik hoe hij opstaat en nog meer onwennig kijk ik naar de vrouw die tegenover mij op handen en knie n zit af te wachten wat ik met haar zal gaan doen
7078830 weet je waar bianca volgens mij behoorlijk jaloers van wordt
7078831 kleed je gepast maar zo dat je je op je gemak voelt
7078832 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7078833 it sounds clich but a personal goal of mine was to return to the island to contribute back to our community here
7078834 hopefully i will be able to inspire students to think critically about the many environmental challenges guam is currently facing as well as the ones that are looming just over the horizon
7078835 all of these former professors and mentors encouraged me to think critically and independently
7078836 guam has had an unfortunate ecological history including poor waste management anthropogenically influenced erosion and sedimentation and a constant influx of invasive species
7078837 reversing this legacy requires educating the community and engaging them in the science behind policy changes you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment tenure track university of guam professor frank a camacho doing some research in the field at the asalonso river camacho is a tenure track faculty member in uogs biology department

7078844 les missions du nigeria et dafrique du sud aussi importantes quelles en aient lair ne sont en aucun cas comparables aux missions des pays industrialis s
7078845 ce nest pas normal que le nigeria et lafrique du sud par exemple r duisent leurs missions alors que les pays industrialis s qui sont en grande partie responsables du changement climatique ne fassent aucun effort pour r duire les leurs
7078846 but us too were selling off older books to make room for new ones
7078847 john mccains experience and bold principled leadership garners a great deal of support in guam and i am proud to support his campaign
7078848 obviously from a chiropractors standpoint anything that puts a load on the body that is not distributed is going to cause a problem in a persons spine
7078849 i see kids come in with a 30 pound backpack
7078850 based on those numbers even if it weighed 10 percent theyd have to weigh 300 pounds for it to be a reasonable amount of weight for them to lug around all day
7078851 it is very important for the staff from the veterans affairs committee to come to guam to investigate ways of improving claims processing for our local veteran community
7078852 i have asked that secretary of veterans affairs the honorable james b peake investigate the potential of establishing a greater va presence on the island possibly to assist with claims processing as well as training of our local vso volunteers
7078853 i am confident that the trip will help the staff inform chairman bob filner of california and subcommittee chairman john hall of new york about the importance of a greater va presence on guam
7078854 i will continue to make every effort to ensure that our veterans are provided with the very best service possible on guam the new majority in congress has increased funding for the va to improve the claims processing system its important that guam also benefit from those additional resources
7078855 people have always come through here throwing their trash and iceboxes washers whatever
7078856 this problem will not be controlled until enforcement is adequately funded so those violating the laws against illegal dumping are identified and the law is enforced against them
7078857 do you have to call every time you need your trash picked up im a paying customer
7078858 they leave us no choice but to pick up residents trash or there will be maggots throughout the village
7078859 a lot of our residents pay their tipping fees like theyre supposed to
7078860 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
7078861 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
7078862 nicht nur ein journalistisches sondern berhaupt ein gro es fernsehtalent
7078863 a pattern of subtle but active faults is known to exist in the region and now new faults have been found the scientists say that among other things the indian point nuclear power plants 24 miles north of the city sit astride the previously unidentified intersection of two active seismic zones
7078864 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7078865 angesichts der angespannten lage kommen wir nicht ohne eine verst rkung der friedenssoldaten aus
7078866 sie haben sich nicht vollst ndig aus den gegenden zur ckgezogen die als nicht umstritten gelten

7078880 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7078881 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7078882 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7078883 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7078884 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq

7078890 call up the dora fun screen for a little relief from the stultifying world of creativity
7078891 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7078892 i think they were struggling between choosing a candidate would represent what barack obama represents change maybe thats somebody like tim kaine of virginia and somebody who represents is a known quantity who does have that kind of national security experience would be a reassurance
7078893 i actually asked about that exchange when he was on my show
7078894 but one of the reasons i think obama decided to go with biden in the end is not only because he has experience but is because he really can be a political gut biter and is a strong debater over the course of the debates during the primary he was often the winner of the debates
7078895 he has served with john mccain for an awful long time and i think the obama team believes that joe biden will have the ability to get under john mccains skin over the course of this campaign and to really be very forceful
7078896 basically the technology is here its just a matter of engineering it for the lowest cost the highest reliability and the longest survivability in a hostile and corrosive environment
7078897 there was a particular appeal about the te awamutu public toilets
7078898 hey if were going to buy books today we need to go like right now because ive got band at 5 30
7078899 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7078900 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7078901 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7078902 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7078903 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7078904 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7078905 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7078906 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7078907 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7078908 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7078909 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7078910 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7078911 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7078912 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7078913 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7078914 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7078915 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7078916 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7078917 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7078918 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7078919 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7078920 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7078921 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7078922 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7078923 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7078924 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7078925 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7078926 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7078927 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7078928 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7078929 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7078930 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7078931 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7078932 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7078933 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7078934 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7078935 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7078936 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7078937 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7078938 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7078939 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7078940 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7078941 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7078942 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7078943 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7078944 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7078945 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7078946 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7078947 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7078948 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7078949 this is a planning took where all things are going
7078950 matt we need you down here at 230 10 no one is tutoring at that time and we need you
7078951 allo cest elodie je me suis pas reiveiller je vais etre en retard pour ouvrir la station
7078952 nanard petit sous chef de la s curit qui surement en mal de reconnaissance ou de pouvoir maverti que mon hotesse tait en retard au cas ou je ne men soi pas rendu compte me precise que je devrais la former mieux car cela le perturbe dans son organisation et pour se faire mousser prend soin de le mettre en copie a mon dirlo
7078953 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7078954 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7078955 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7078956 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7078957 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7078958 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7078959 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7078960 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7078961 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7078962 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7078963 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7078964 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7078965 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7078966 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7078967 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7078968 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7078969 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7078970 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7078971 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7078972 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7078973 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7078974 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7078975 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7078976 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7078977 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7078978 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7078979 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7078980 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7078981 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7078982 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7078983 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7078984 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7078985 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7078986 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7078987 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7078988 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7078989 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7078990 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7078991 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7078992 students for a free tibet has organized eight nonviolent direct actions here while weve been in china successfully
7078993 this is not the end of our campaign this is only the beginning
7078994 when china was awarded the olympics protest was inevitable what were doing today is standing in solidarity with tibetans inside tibet
7078995 thousands remain detained and missing following chinas violent and brutal crackdown against tibetans who risked everything taking to the streets to speak out for human rights freedom and justice
7078996 while we know that the chinese authorities are likely to step up their attacks on tibetans in the coming months as the olympic spotlight fades we also know that change only comes when people stand up and demand it the historic protests that have taken place in beijing in tibet and around the world this olympic year have ensured that tibet is recognized as an issue of global significance that demands immediate attention from the chinese leadership and governments around the world
7078997 it is clear that in the face of growing public outrage the bush administration reconfigured its attack on womens reproductive freedom this new version drops a provision from the earlier draft but fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
7078998 we will continue to mobilize our members to call on the bush administration to include in the final regulation explicit language clarifying that birth control is not at risk
7078999 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden joe biden is a strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what america stands for he will be a strong partner with barack obama in bringing the change america wants and needs
7079000 delegates here in denver are already buzzing with strong enthusiasm for the obama biden ticket
7079001 senator obamas selection shows that unlike the bush mccain way of doing politics obama is not afraid to have strong people around him helping to lead our great country
7079002 together they will serve america well over the next eight years and our party is ready to rally behind them and put them on the path to the white house starting right here in denver
7079003 this project is the culmination of international negotiations and extensive work among representatives of the department of the interior and the bureau of reclamation in partnership and cooperation with lower colorado river basin states and the regions water districts
7079004 the project will help to ensure efficient and effective water management benefiting water users by allowing them to capture for future use colorado river water that would otherwise be lost
7079005 this contract award signals the next phase of a significant water storage project near our nations southern border
7079006 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
7079007 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
7079008 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
7079009 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
7079010 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
7079011 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
7079012 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
7079013 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
7079014 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
7079015 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples
7079016 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7079017 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7079018 we also call for respect for free expression to become one of the criteria when selecting cities to host the games
7079019 we hail all those in china and abroad who did not stop pressing for more freedom of expression before the olympic games
7079020 we will remain vigilant in case the post olympic period ushers in a new wave of repression
7079021 they dont stop following me filming me and photographing me
7079022 i think twice before interviewing chinese about sensitive issues for fear that they could be arrested
7079023 i hope that the 2008 games will be over as quickly as possible as this event has brought us too much suffering
7079024 to ensure the safety of information on the internet during the beijing olympics and in accordance with requests from higher authorities xinwang hulian will conduct a safety inspection of its sites
7079025 the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
7079026 ce qui fait que dans linstant je ne dors plus alors adieu mon repos du matin
7079027 at 369 the heavenly pass is a phenomenal deal for lake tahoes top resort
7079028 combining that price with all our improvements and the instant 25 savings makes it a virtual steal and a great way to start the ski or ride season which will be here sooner than we think
7079029 im all for federal funding of faith based partnerships when the money is given to established social service agencies that can then partner with local congregations
7079030 small churches cant handle the incredible amount of groundwork that needs to be done in order to provide community services
7079031 run counter to the thinking of the bush faith based initiative the core of which obama would build on we found that the community is the place where everything must center and that mainline community organizations like the united way not small start up organizations are better suited to address multi faceted community problems
7079032 our research goal is to help community leaders match resources to needs
7079033 these findings mirror emerging research elsewhere and the ones i uncovered in greensboro in the 1990s delaware is not an anomaly a new initiative could use federal dollars to help community stewards strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones
7079034 es un partido que se puede ganar tenemos esa idea desde que inici la semana ellos son un equipo fuerte pero nosotros tambi n tenemos la motivaci n para salir a hacer un buen partido
7079035 i have to say miss mortaz this situation doesnt have to be what it is now
7079036 i know it doesnt mark i know this reeks of volatility and you are essentially my hostage
7079037 you have to understand though how desperate i am rest assured if you cede to my requests without any fuss ill put this magnificient beast of a weapon away and we shall be able to talk like civilised human beings does that sound good mark
7079038 y yes that sounds perfect whatever it is miss mortaz i can help you its my job
7079039 im well aware of that mark dont patronise me as i said before i have several requests one of them which youve just mentioned is the matter of help you can probably tell by the way i barged in here and took control of your life that i require assistance of the highest order
7079040 im pushing forty mark yes here i am a chick revealing her age thats just it im not your normal woman im complicated have been my whole life and by that i include all the crazy shit ive been involved in ever since i was shot four times in the stomach by an informant turned bad my existence has never been the same since that fateful night hell i cry myself to sleep at night because everytime i close my eyes i am reminded of all the insane things ive done over the last ten years
7079041 so mark heres the deal you are going to be my official psycharitrist from here on out i have no friends except for this lovely weapon you see here and i have no family i have enemies hundreds of time but at this stage of my life i really need someone i can confide in which is where your services are requested youll be my shrink and ill pay you accordingly under the table of course the other requests that i have that comes later on in our relationship if you agree to be my shrink this incident here will never be repeated to anyone else doctor client privilege understood
7079042 o okay miss mortaz let me just get this straight you have led a very tough life by your own definition and therefore you have come here today because you require my professional services you do however seek the need for our potential relationship to be covert which means i have to ignore several things like for instance you kicking the door to my office open producing a weapon and aiming it at me locking me inside my own office and making demands at me after calmly introducing yourself oh and i also have to act as if ive never met you and that i actually dont have you as my client is that correct miss mortaz
7079043 indeed mark and please call me ana lucia looks like we have everything worked out then which means i can now put my great equaliser away and apologise for resorting to the measures i did

7079099 senator my name is cal perry im a reporter from cnn and just wanted to say hello
7079100 i was only 29 years old when i was elected to the u s senate
7079101 senator its time to go back to the united states

7079103 you might be smarter than me but not smarter than my team
7079104 if biden said obama is not ready for being president how does he then run for vice pres
7079105 in the end people will vote for someone they know
7079106 hell be treated like a casey a scranton a rodham
7079107 i dont think this will totally satisfy some of senator clintons backers but once local boy joe biden comes home and gets them on board i think it will help a lot
7079108 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7079109 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7079110 you never know what you dont know but we have spent more time planning and training than i think any city in history for a national convention
7079111 thats not to say that things wont happen but what were saying is that were prepared to deal with anything
7079112 certainly there will be an increased police presence near the venues
7079113 folks can expect to see law enforcement on some rooftops near the pepsi center and near invesco field
7079114 there will be lots of security measures in place that will not be visible to the eye
7079115 if youre throwing a birthday party at your house and you invite 100 people you prepare for 100 people if 120 show up and you got some steaks in the freezer you yank them out and use them
7079116 i hope to god it goes easy safe and nobody causes any problems but were prepared
7079117 im very confident as far as the security mechanisms weve put in place i think denver will be showcased
7079118 my anniversary was this month i owe my wife a trip somewhere
7079119 that the efforts of state agencies to assist our federal and local partners is effectively coordinated

7079121 host a historical event in denver while the police department supports individuals rights to express their first amendment rights
7079122 i feel very confident that were able to handle situations as they occur

7079129 i know better than you what you are and what you want
7079130 what does it take for a rural place to be economically vibrant
7079131 contrary to expectation higher federal grant funding per capita tends to exacerbate rather than ameliorate poverty rates in a locality
7079132 this suggests the possibility of reverse causality that federal grants are directed more to poorer places
7079133 yields the same result even when we control for initial poverty rates
7079134 they found that rural places with more of these meeting places and organizations had lower levels of family poverty social capital seemed to reduce poverty in rural america this wasnt true in the cities where social capital had little effect on family poverty rates
7079135 the more big box retailers like wal mart there are in a community the higher the family poverty rate many rural communities try to attract big box retailers the two researchers conclude this strategy may be self defeating
7079136 jobs created by big box retailers are mostly low paying jobs that may not help families escape from poverty and these establishments tend also not to reinvest locally their profits earned

7079138 the fact is john mccains service during vietnam was honorable and he sacrificed a great deal but his service to the country carries no more weight than that of any other pow likewise while mccain has given so much to his country thousands of veterans past and present have given as much or more in this war alone thousands of troops have lost limbs been paralyzed and been burned beyond recognition so to see mccain resort to playing the pow card when answering legitimate questions in my mind cheapens that experience and by cheapening his own experience in war he degrades all of our experiences in war he turns the horrific incidents weve all seen touched smelled and felt into a lame excuse to earn political points and it dishonors us all

7079158 i have no information that leads me to believe there was any problem
7079159 this isnt an issue about number of inspectors or how the inspectors look at stuff or company responsibilities
7079160 it just happens to get in the food supply despite having a good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances and every once in a while these things can and will happen
7079161 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7079162 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7079163 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
7079164 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze

7079176 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7079177 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater in the future
7079178 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive
7079179 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles

7079194 the boys had the right work ethic but we are just a little bit hesitant and not as confident its disjointed mainly because we cant apply pressure through those basic errors
7079195 there were a couple of interesting calls out there but in the end they werent deciding factors we just didnt play enough footy
7079196 to be honest we are disappointed we talked all week about coming up here and playing some footy to win a shield you have to dare to win we couldnt get our lineout going we couldnt get any structure from that and when we did get the ball we didnt treasure it
7079197 we just didnt front well enough but it wasnt a great auckland performance either so if we had played with the sort of intensity we played with against canterbury and late against waikato we could have had a decent shot id think
7079198 hes keen to go next week we just need to make sure we get the final clearance
7079199 in final exam pauline chen tells the story of her own medical education and the many crucial experiences with patients that lead her to become a more empathic more compassionate and more patient oriented doctor i never intended chen writes to make my living among the dying she began her medical career with dreams of saving lives but found very quickly that death would be a constant though largely unacknowledged companion
7079200 i had comforted my patient and his family i had eased their suffering i had been present for them during life and despite death i had caught a glimpse of the doctor i could become
7079201 it was clear this election was going to be about change
7079202 people were ready to turn the page for a new approach to politics
7079203 i think it gave senator obama great credibility early on in the community of heavyweight fundraisers and political activists
7079204 hillary got the top three tiers of people in terms of staff and members of congress and surrogates
7079205 edwards got the fourth tier barack got the fifth tier with a couple of notable exceptions wexler was that exception
7079206 i was convinced then and im even more convinced now that senator obamas staunch support for israel and his compelling case to directly engage in diplomacy with iran for the purpose of thwarting irans nuclear ambition and stopping their financial support for terror was the most pro israel position that a presidential candidate could take
7079207 theyre a seal of good housekeeping as far as chicago jews are concerned with baracks bona fides
7079208 when he was running for congress and later on for the senate i would help organize fundraisers for him on the north shore which had been my congressional district and along the lakefront in chicago a lot of people who came to those were jewish
7079209 its a part of the yiddishkheit we grew up with to be a liberal
7079210 i was fascinated from the first time i saw him with jewish constituents at how easily they got along with him how much they liked him and were drawn to him and how well he answered questions particularly on israel

7079216 weet je wel hoe slecht die mensen het daar hebben of kan je dat niets schelen
7079217 o die mensen mogen het van mij daar net zo goed krijgen als hier hoor
7079218 en als die mensen het daar straks net zo goed hebben als hier dan verkoop ik mijn huizen en heb k het alsnog beter
7079219 he probably was confused as to which homes are in his name his wifes name or corporate names

7079226 please make sure to love and take care of each other its important
7079227 the national budget must be balanced the public debt must be reduced the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled payments to foreign governments must be reduced if the nation doesnt want to go bankrupt people must again learn to work instead of living on public assistance
7079228 the summer phony war for the us presidency is about to end what do markets tell us about the race for the white house
7079229 if the prediction markets run by the university of iowa and intrade are right barack obama is the frontrunner but no
7079230 national polls suggest the markets are too optimistic about mr obama they show the race narrowing in recent weeks with john mccain improving a poll of national polls by pollster com puts mr obamas lead at 45 2 to 43 the trend favours mr mccain
7079231 but state by state surveys favour mr obama by pollster coms reckoning 260 votes in the electoral college are strongly behind him or leaning his way he needs 270 to win
7079232 the elections seem to be all about the economy mr mccains intrade chances of winning bottomed on the same day that the s amp p 500 bottomed last month mr obamas chances hit their peak a day after the oil price reached a top
7079233 mr mccains rise in national polls may be chiefly a reaction to easing pressure on pump prices an economic variable that is very visible to voters
7079234 on thursday crude oil shot back above 120 a barrel as traders took fright at the tension caused by the missile deal between the us and poland
7079235 i believe we are on the eve of world deflation i pulled out a headline from the august 5 wall street journal headline inflation pace is fastest in 17 years
7079236 forget it this is history this is not whats happening in the market
7079237 what i see is a coming world deflation and i believe thats the message the markets are sending
7079238 i think the fed and other central banks would welcome a deflation scare over the next year or two not least to recapitalise banks through the yield curve and cushion the housing market
7079239 this would be bullish for fullermoney themes precious metals industrial commodities agricultural commodities subject to weather conditions global infrastructure development and emerging markets which have weakened during the last year due to deleveraging and recession fears however while there will always be opportunities it would be prudent to recognise that we may be journeying further into the trough of this global economic slowdown before we really profit from the next upside fortunately stock markets have a history of bottoming months before recessions and slowdowns are judged to have officially ended
7079240 the ifo world economic climate has worsened in the third quarter of 2008 for the fourth time in succession the decline is primarily the result of more unfavourable assessments of the current economic situation but also the expectations for the coming six months have been revised downwards
7079241 the worsening of the ifo world economic climate has affected above all
7079242 inflation expectations for 2008 in the us at 3 8 are clearly higher than the price increases for 2007 2 8 also in
7079243 in contrast to the previous survey the wes experts expect an increase in
7079244 half the world economy including the uk is in recession or on the brink according to research from goldman sachs
7079245 the investment bank has warned that the worlds major economies including the us japan the eurozone and the uk are either in recession or face significant recession in the months ahead
7079246 it also raised fears that the slump could have a profound knock on effect for china whose thirst for raw materials and consumer products has been propping up many economies
7079247 america the worlds largest economy has so far avoided recession news that has helped the dollars recent recovery
7079248 france and germanys economies have shrunk in the second quarter of the year along with japans meanwhile many fear that the uks official statistics will soon show the economy shrinking
7079249 chairman bernankes comments were largely focused on measures necessary to reduce systemic risk and maintain financial market stability
7079250 a year into the financial crisis the news is grim and there are signs of even worse troubles ahead the mortgage bust continues and has begun to spread to loans for construction and commercial property as well as credit cards and auto loans
7079251 there may soon be more bank failures and a spate of corporate bankruptcies
7079252 in an election year sound policy making is almost always trumped by political posturing making the situation even bleaker
7079253 the laws other important feature a contingency plan for a government bailout of fannie mae and freddie mac the nations biggest mortgage companies was a last minute crisis driven addition the opposite of the ahead of the curve action that is now needed
7079254 the country cannot afford more delay and more posturing before the crisis gets any worse congress must take several steps
7079255 lawmakers need to start crafting the next stimulus bill without repeating the mistakes of the last one
7079256 congress also needs to ensure that a 4 billion grant to states and cities to buy up vacant properties is quickly and efficiently distributed
7079257 congress also cannot wait to see if its anti foreclosure measures work
7079258 the work doesnt end there the bush administration and federal regulators need to develop a framework for resolving future financial failures before they occur that is essential for rebuilding confidence in the system
7079259 millions of americans are already suffering and we fear millions more will be hurt before this crisis ends they cannot wait until after the election for help

7079262 below we highlight a one year chart of the cdx north american investment grade credit index that measures credit default swap prices for a number of us companies
7079263 the deepening toll from the global financial crisis could trigger the failure of a large us bank within months a respected former chief economist of the international monetary fund claimed today fuelling another battering for banking shares
7079264 professor kenneth rogoff a leading academic economist said there was yet worse news to come from the worldwide credit crunch and financial turmoil particularly in the united states and that a high profile casualty among american banks was highly likely
7079265 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come prof rogoff said at a conference in singapore
7079266 in an ominous warning he added were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks he said
7079267 rising anxieties over worse to come in the credit crisis sent shares tumbling in europe and asia
7079268 professor rogoff who was chief economist at the imf from 2001 to 2004 predicted that the crisis would foster a new wave of consolidation in the us financial sector before it was over with mergers between large institutions
7079269 the key rate at which banks lend to each other in dollars hit its highest level in two months on monday suggesting there could be more turbulence ahead for the financial system
7079270 the three month dollar london interbank offered rate reached 2
7079271 the rise in the money market benchmark for loans and derivatives is occurring even though expectations of a federal reserve interest rate hike have been declining in the past two months
7079272 when libor was previously set at 2 81 investors were expecting the fed would raise its overnight rate to nearly 3 by the end of the year now investors expect a funds rate of about 2 10 by year end
7079273 there has been a reassessment of fed expectations and they are now seen keeping rates steady
7079274 further evidence emerged last week that banks were scrambling to raise short term funds concerns about banks health have made it harder and more expensive for them to access short term funds
7079275 the option arm allows borrowers to pay less interest than the formal rate for a limited period the vast majority of customers choose this option
7079276 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months
7079277 data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money aggregates fell by almost 50 billion in july the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
7079278 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed said gabriel stein the groups leading monetary economist
7079279 on a three month basis the m3 growth rate has fallen from almost 19 earlier this year to just 2 1 annualized for the period from may to july this is below the rate of inflation implying a shrinkage in real terms
7079280 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can said mr stein
7079281 the conference boards index of leading economic indicators lei fell 0
7079282 the housing market index hmi of the national association of home builders held steady at 16 in august matching the record low set in july
7079283 downside risks to economic growth and contracting corporate credit demand will overwhelm the upward pressure on yields from inflation and treasury supply fears
7079284 our model of the 5 year treasury note suggests that the additional treasury supply due to the increase in the budget deficit anticipated over the next year will have only a negligible effect on yields
7079285 the msci world index which measures global equity market performance is now up just 68 not total return since its bottom on march 12 2003
7079286 since the 3 12 03 global market bottom brazil india and mexico all have total returns of more than 400 with brazil leading the way at 427
7079287 so while much has been made of how well the us has held up during this downturn it still lags behind pretty much everyone else when looking at the last bull and the current bear financial times august 20 2008
7079288 emerging market stocks have tumbled more than is justified because demand for raw materials continues to boost economic growth in those nations mark mobius said
7079289 the correction seems to be overdone but not necessarily over because sentiment globally is very bad mobius who oversees about 40 billion in emerging market equities as executive chairman of templeton asset management in singapore said in a bloomberg radio interview
7079290 the msci emerging markets index has plunged 28 since reaching a record in october as falling oil and metal prices prompted investors to pull money from commodity producing nations
7079291 its more a correction than a significant downturn in the commodities markets the 71 year old investor said
7079292 developing nations will continue to grow at a very rapid pace even as investors anticipate slowdowns in the us and europe mobius said
7079293 mobius said hes buying as many consumer shares in emerging markets as he can
7079294 brazil is among the nations where mobius has invested the most although he remains optimistic about the nations prospects he said speculation that the government may keep some oil profits instead of channeling them through petrobras is worrisome
7079295 only one share on the shanghai a share market had a negative return today
7079296 the us s rally this month can largely be attributed to bad news coming from europe
7079297 global capital flows are looking increasingly supportive of the dollar believes stephen hull currency strategist at lehman brothers
7079298 he notes that there has been a significant improvement in the us trade deficit recently with the gap between import and export volume growth now at its highest level since 1994
7079299 related to this are several major issues that are key to foreign exchange markets
7079300 mr hull believes the us current account deficit will shrink sharply
7079301 as the dollar starts to rise there will be less need for foreign central banks to build up reserves to prevent their own currencies from strengthening he says
7079302 many exchange rates in countries with current account surpluses have been managed to prevent domestic currency appreciation if the dollar rallies on its own reserve accumulation will slow
7079303 central banks have also been diversifying their foreign exchange reserves in recent years with international monetary fund data indicating increased amounts of fx reserves in euros
7079304 however if reserves stop rising some central banks might already have more than sufficient non dollar currencies in their reserves and the vicious circle that has driven the euro to such heights might be broken
7079305 gold surged on tuesday after an early decline on the release of the ppi
7079306 as we have asserted over the past week once the levered dollar plays dollar vs forex dollar vs gold dollar vs commodity were liquidated fundamentals would re emerge this occurred yesterday with gold
7079307 wsj as gold prices tumbled from their highest level ever investors and collectors loaded up on one ounce
7079308 after reviewing all of the technical economic and fundamental factors over the weekend following are our latest thoughts on whats currently happening
7079309 on friday gold broke clearly below its 65 week moving average which is at 819
7079310 stay put for the time being and keep your metals related positions
7079311 since gold is so oversold the extent of its rebound rise is now going to be very important
7079312 on the other hand if gold stays below 819 during the rebound rise itll mean that an important trend change is taking place and well either sell or lighten up on our holdings at a better price during the rebound well then plan to buy gold again once it turns technically bullish
7079313 recent negativity surrounding the outlook for the platinum price might have been overdone argues leon esterhuizen analyst at rbc capital markets
7079314 while the world economy is slowing leading to lower auto and jewellery sales and metal supply projected to expand we believe this need not ultimately be bad for platinum group metals
7079315 he acknowledges that a real risk lies with jewellery demand but says the recent drop in the platinum price should offer some support
7079316 supply dynamics are essentially a function of two things restricted capacity of the majors to expand due to electricity shortages that will not be resolved anytime soon and junior production being delayed
7079317 this exacerbates the capacity to find funding compounding the potential for much lower actual supply than currently forecast
7079318 this leads us to cut our short term outlook but we increase our longer term metal price forecasts in line with what we see as the absolute minimum required to get new production on line
7079319 our latest insight into europes economic future comes from the little country of belgium
7079320 strictly using the bnb business survey as a guide the euro zone economy should not exactly be heading for recession
7079321 china is considering a post olympics stimulus package of as much as 58 billion in addition to other monetary easing measures according to a research report by jpmorgan
7079322 the measures could include tax cuts and other moves to shore up the capital markets and support the housing market according to a research note by the brokers head of china research frank gong
7079323 the top leadership is carefully considering an economic stimulus package of at least 200 billion yuan to 400 billion yuan gong wrote tuesday
7079324 the notion that china will experience a post olympics slowdown has generated much discussion among investors says jing ulrich chairman china equities at jpmorgan
7079325 but she believes that chinas problems have little to do with the olympics and more with slowing global demand rising input costs and domestic imbalances
7079326 beijings investment of some 40 billion in infrastructure to host the games may be unsurpassed but this figure amounts to a tiny fraction of chinas fixed asset investment she says
7079327 ms ulrich says that as the economy moderates official priorities are tilting towards maintaining growth and employment
7079328 authorities recently raised the export tax rebate for textiles and clothing companies and increased the annual loan quota for banks
7079329 chinas economy is indeed slowing but the timing is largely coincidental
7079330 mainland china overtook the us as japans largest export destination for the first time last month underlining the growing importance of chinese demand to the worlds second largest economy
7079331 exports to china which have risen in each of the last 38 months expanded by 16
7079332 at the same time exports to the us declined by 11
7079333 japanese companies such as toyota honda motor and komatsu have recently identified an increasing reliance on china and other emerging markets for sales growth as the us economy slows
7079334 however the export growth will provide little cheer to policymakers faced with rising input costs and an uncertain outlook in the economies of japans main trading partners
7079335 for july rightmove reported a 2 year on year drop in house prices
7079336 figures are not seasonally adjusted but add to overwhelming evidence of a severe downturn in the british housing market as buyers find it harder to get a mortgage as banks tighten lending conditions and the economy cools
7079337 last weeks release showed that second quarter retail sales adjusted for inflation in new zealand fell 1
7079338 regardless consumer spending is likely to deteriorate further in the months ahead as the housing bust continues and the job market weakens
7079339 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7079340 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7079341 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7079342 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7079343 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7079344 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7079345 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7079346 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7079347 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7079348 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7079349 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7079350 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7079351 now they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7079352 apple has figured out how it wants to tap demand from all those corporate types that wish their employer would support the iphone as well as other devices such as the blackberry
7079353 just got an email from apple pr the company is going to announce its plans on the iphone sdk at the apple campus on march 6 the email invitation says please join us to learn about the iphone software roadmap including the iphone sdk and some exciting new enterprise features those enterprise features probably involve some level of support for microsoft exchange above and beyond simple imap support which has been the one big feature requested since day one ill be curious to see what else in the enterprise category that apple has on tap

7079373 ich sage das als gpda mitglied und als rennfahrer wir sind sehr besorgt denn es ist ein nachtrennen aber wir haben das noch nie zuvor getestet
7079374 noch dazu fahren wir in singapur zu einer zeit im jahr wo es sehr oft regnet wenn es nachts regnet wird es unbequem das ist von der sicherheit her nicht das was man sich w nscht

7079379 sen barack obama has made the right for choice for america
7079380 sen joe biden is a true champion for hardworking middle class families who has served our country with distinction in the senate he is an experienced leader who will make an excellent vice president
7079381 from barack obamas historic victory in the iowa caucuses seven months ago to joe bidens years in our state its clear to me that this is a winning team
7079382 from economic recovery to energy security to creating the jobs of the future barack obama and joe biden have the energy the experience and the ideas to renew our people here at home and to restore americas role as the worlds leader
7079383 we dont have to have anybody go outside and close the windows anymore
7079384 its wonderful to see how bright things are in here now
7079385 it does make me very emotional because i didnt realize so many people there did care
7079386 the best reward i get in my job is a hug from a soldier
7079387 soa involves rethinking how the business leverages it in many various ways

7079389 s d as cousas son infinitas o universo e a estupidez humana e do primero non estou tan seguro
7079390 its not all bad biden was also responsible for vawa the violence against women act and has a good record on foreign policy an area in which obama is perceived as untested still its a far cry from a hillary vice presidency
7079391 i told him after the game that he ought to grab his film and look at it especially from his mvp year when he was hitting the ball really good and was consistent
7079392 it always reminds you of how youre swinging and that right there is what we have to have out of him
7079393 ive watched tapes from 2006 a couple different times throughout the year
7079394 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7079395 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7079396 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7079397 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7079398 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7079399 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7079400 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7079401 team on border of this may be some shared reso re agile version control with multiple teams
7079402 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7079403 i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7079404 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7079405 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data
7079406 we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3
7079407 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow
7079408 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points
7079409 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play
7079410 in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way
7079411 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7079412 this wasnt bad i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the option tyre so we need to work on that but i am happy that our performance is getting better im really pleased to be in q3 for the first time its a good feeling as i kept waiting to hear that i dropped down to 11 or 12 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race
7079413 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7079414 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7079415 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out
7079416 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7079417 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7079418 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7079419 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn five and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7079420 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7079421 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid
7079422 i will pledge x i am doing 5 pounds per game sasha plays and keeps himself out of the officials book but only if 20 people will do the same
7079423 hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up
7079424 e unazione in forze con mortai e mitragliere condotta da un migliaio di uomini lo scontro impari che si protrae per ore costa perdite agli attaccanti ma cadono anche 18 giovani partigiani insieme al loro ancor pi giovane comandante leandro puccetti medaglia doro al valor militare
7079425 i think its more responsible for everyone to be responsible to the city and the citizens of marathon
7079426 we have a finite pool of folks so we have to look to neighboring counties for these folks to come down our job is to make it even more appealing for them to come down here
7079427 you start plugging in the bennies and it becomes more of a career path
7079428 we will have plenty of food drink and tissues boxes
7079429 i boo hooed when he got the nomination i am going to cry like a baby when he accepts it
7079430 from a black perspective it holds a great deal of meaning
7079431 what we read into it is we are further down the road to achieving dr kings dream
7079432 the feeling i got was so emotional i was on fire
7079433 that was 45 years ago and i can still remember where i was what i was doing when i heard kings speech if i live another 45 years i imagine i will remember the emotions i will feel when barack obama accepts the presidential nomination of the democratic party
7079434 for me it is the 40th anniversary of watching julian bond on stage being nominated for vice president
7079435 as a 16 year old seeing this handsome articulate black man made me think why cant he be vice president i joined the young democrats i saw the possibility in 1968
7079436 he gives me hope that the way government is now will change
7079437 in 2004 24 1 million people voted in the democratic primaries in 2008 primaries 56 million voted a lot of that was youth and a large percentage of that is black youth
7079438 in some states particularly in the south black young people are voting more than young whites
7079439 weve turned the corner in race relations if barack obama is elected
7079440 i find it totally unacceptable to write off big batches of money because robins showed me it doesnt have to be that way
7079441 we explain how the balance got there and the claims process that includes deductibles and co pays
7079442 with government payers if you provide them the right information in the right format theyll pay
7079443 we understand how the system works and review contracts we identify the issue negotiate and ask them to reconsider
7079444 the money we recover is paid directly to the client and we dont bill until the money is in the clients bank
7079445 they take over accounts we were finding difficult to collect on act quickly and many times are successful right then in getting a credit card payment

7079452 many places couldnt get along or function without them they really make an impact on what we do and who we are
7079453 i had an interest and its an easy way to put in volunteer hours
7079454 think about what have you been wanting to do what skills you have that maybe you are not utilizing and someone or a population youve always wanted to work with thats always interested you
7079455 they have lots of listings for lots of different agencies and projects that work with lots of different kinds of people
7079456 that will help decide what types of things you can do
7079457 you cant volunteer if it takes a lot of training and youre only willing to volunteer once or twice
7079458 there are people who can be going all day and there are people who need extra down time
7079459 there are many times you can get experience doing what youd like to learn or are not very skilled at by volunteering
7079460 thats why thinking about what you want to do and what you want to get out of the experience is so important
7079461 its not just about what i want to do but about helping others and having fun
7079462 teaches good ethics and shows children that giving back is important
7079463 its a good experience for the kids and one i hope they take on in their lives
7079464 due to the price of gas we have had a few volunteers ask that we assign them to patients closer to their homes however this has had no impact on the availability of volunteers for hospicecare patients

7079475 well go over to my camp then im going to have to return to st genevieve
7079476 ill have to get my carriage was going to send for it later in the week but i need to ride to st louis
7079477 im going to have to leave you in charge antoine until i get back
7079478 lets get over to my camp before the sun sets gentlemen
7079479 buehler could you muster the men i need to make an announcement
7079480 this is your new second in command lieutenant antoine wolff
7079481 this other fellow is mr henri laurent my new aide de camp
7079482 i hope youre rested today for we will be back to our duties first thing tomorrow morning i must ride to st louis to procure more men and supplies for my assurance of volunteers from frederickstown has only garnered three men and i thank these three for joining our worthy cause
7079483 this shouldnt discourage you men for it only proves your virtue in serving this government and your courage in defending these free lands of ours
7079484 i need three men for guard shifts tonight and youll receive extra rations for supper tomorrow
7079485 ill be leaving within the hour for st louis and you will follow the lieutenants orders as you would my own be alert for any trouble tonight make sure your weapons are clean and secure and lieutenant wolff will give out your assigments in the morning good night gentlemen you are dismissed
7079486 bring some for the three of us and bring up some chickory if you can
7079487 you boys will have to get a fire going out front to keep warm before bed
7079488 lieutenant could you and mr laurent move that table into the middle
7079489 my pardon sir but i didnt know i had a position in this group
7079490 yes yes well you can read and write i suppose
7079491 fine most men in this outfit cant little formal education buehler can write some but hes better with numbers
7079492 not to belittle your abilities mr laurent but the position is nothing more than a glorified secretary
7079493 youll have to keep records of the day help the lieutenant and i with various duties and errands feed and saddle our horses
7079494 you dont want the position mr laurent beats guarding these heathen workers out here
7079495 of course i would be glad to sir but i may have to
7079496 i trust that you will know how to run this outfit as soon as possible
7079497 all the rules and regulations of our federal army also apply to our militia there are no exceptions antoine
7079498 the camp is to be up at dawn they get themselves ready eat breakfast and at seven a m the men will muster like you saw tonight and keep em in line
7079499 no man in this outfit including ourselves is to go into town for other than supplies or military business and if you catch anyone doing otherwise you have orders to either flog the perpetrator or send him packing
7079500 theres an old saying in the army lieutenant take no bull and youll get no bull
7079501 when do you let the men go into town for pleasure i mean
7079502 saturdays right after lunch before lunch the men take care of chores cleaning tents gathering wood tasks of that nature we dont dole out money for them to spend either payday is the first and fifteenth of the month and if theyre broke in between well thats their business
7079503 therell be no whoring or gambling in this camp even on off days sundays is for rest and we stay here if anybody other than this militia wanders into camp no matter who they are you are to have them brought straight to me or to yourself and you can interrogate them as to their business
7079504 while im gone make sure you pick three men every night for guard duty and each takes a five hour shift and covers the camp from the road to the woods beyond discharge any man you catch sleeping on watch each of these men have brought their own rifles or guns but make sure before you send them out in the morning that theyve actually got them and that theyre cleaned and ready to fire
7079505 i dont mean to be impertinent sir but some of these men are a lot older than i am wont they take offense at someone my age leading them
7079506 ive never seen an outfit or army that didnt need a leader son no matter what their age most men look to someone for guidance or orders only a few of us are capable to govern it is the law of nature
7079507 you show those men the same spirit i saw on the commons yesterday when you took on those boys and i assure you lieutenant wolff you wont have a lick of trouble show them any weakness son
7079508 and they wont ever fire straight in a fight for you understood
7079509 make a head count every morning make sure youve got the same men when you leave and when you return also son youre an officer now and these are enlisted men so therell be no fraternizing you can visit them from time to time check on their welfare and look for rulebreaking but dont overdo it that goes for you too mr laurent
7079510 any punishments other than what ive mentioned come in the tent and check the manual but dont do it in front of the men dont let them see you sweat
7079511 if you have any trouble with the men and i dont think you will have corporal buehler lend a hand hes done it before
7079512 one last thing before i show you the orders of movement
7079513 these raiders these southern sympathizers have no fear of us theyll shoot you rather than look at you dont ever hesitate
7079514 one of the reasons for the head count lieutenant is that these bastards dont sneak inside on us one of their favorite tactics is to dress in the enemys uniform meaning ours or the armys and ambush us as they come up get to know their faces son
7079515 this is the railroad thats being laid heres ironton and iron mountain were here
7079516 my problem lieutenant and the reason i need more men is that part of this line already laid has been messed up and the company has to go back over it half their workers are refixing about a quarter mile of the line here while the other half lays the oncoming line
7079517 so far theyve been making progress but its slow going because of this weather and these killings around here spooking everybody
7079518 theyre a mile from ironton they plan to go through it which is why they moved their camp south of town
7079519 but my problem is that darn backtracking creamers men have to do we have to spread too few men out along a damn three mile line thats why i need more soldiers i have to split my company up
7079520 what youre going to do in the morning after breakfast is split the men into two groups weve got twenty five soldiers now so thats twelve in a group plus an extra put the extra in either group or use him on your end whichever
7079521 use your discretion split up the young ones though and keep them in the middle of the guarding line
7079522 yes the manner in which you post the men along the rail line most of these men know how to keep watch but make sure they post a safe distance from each other along the work line so theyll cover everybody
7079523 rotate the men to go back to the camp for lunch and when the workers are done so are we also we are to escort the workers back to their own camp
7079524 every man is to be in bunk by nine at night and if theyre not see fit to punish them
7079525 fairweather limped over to the back end of the tent pulled something out from behind a cot and came back over with it
7079526 in the morning see corporal buehler for a uniform hat included
7079527 is from the governor himself i must say he thinks a lot of you and your family
7079528 heres your insignia for both the shirt and the jacket youre official son
7079529 they go over the left breast pocket lieutenant and make sure you dont lose them
7079530 im at a loss to thank you sir but thank you very much
7079531 i must get to st genevieve hopefully i can make it before midnight
7079532 yes thats what it was both of you go see buehler in the morning for a belt and holster
7079533 buehler will give you one keep it loaded wear it at all times always sleep with a gun by your side
7079534 ill do it in the morning henri seems better that way

7079537 altogether it has been a very difficult day and a disappointing qualifying result yesterday we had a very competitive friday especially with timo and now things have turned around jarno did a fantastic job because he could not run in p3 this morning due to a gearbox oil pump problem but that did not stop him and all his laps apart from his last lap in q3 were very good for timo today was not as successful as yesterday he was on the pace in q1 but q2 did not go as expected so we will have to investigate what happened after the overnight rain the track was green again today but the tyre situation is clear the positive thing for us is that we are in good position to defend against safety cars tomorrow and make sure that both cars are not caught out by the same safety car period
7079538 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7079539 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
7079540 the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity your fears are paper tigers you can do anything you decide to do you can act to change and control your life and the procedure the process is its own reward

7079662 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7079663 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7079664 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7079665 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm

7079681 i wouldnt like to be in the position where it comes down to me choosing between a deal for a couple of years and setting up the family or playing in the league tournament for one month

7079684 id like to sort my future out sooner rather than later its about whats best for my family
7079685 i want people to know that im not choosing to leave to go to union

7079691 shocked and saddened that its got this far in terms of the allegations and charges
7079692 there are two sides to a story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
