1850081 however we have to define blogger relations to me it has two meanings 1 the pitching part in media relations but to bloggers 2 having a dialogue with a blogger without the intent of pitching something but to share ideas and discussion

1850112 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active
1850113 there are the supermarkets selling alcohol very cheaply while in the pubs it is relatively expensive and you can no longer smoke
1850114 then you have got an economic situation with everybody having to adapt to the lack of credit and spending power and a government which is upping the duty on alcohol and making it the new tobacco in terms of the damage they say it is causing to our health
1850115 it has provenance it can be organic it can be green it can be local all things that people are looking for these days
1850116 so for pubs its something that looks good to have on your bars and it can drive traffic
1850117 it fits in with the pressure that they are under to offer variety and to be more local
1850118 the market might be getting quieter overall but weve not noticed a downturn in business at all
1850119 there are pubs closing which is worrying but it tends to be the less well run pubs that do shut
1850120 and while the supermarkets sell drink cheaply its a different market if somebody wants a nice ale perhaps something different they will seek it out in a pub

1850129 weve been hearing from athletes for several months that they would have extra screening in beijing if they didnt distance themselves from us

1850149 because of mary a whole new era comes into the world shes like a bridge between heaven and earth and like mary i believe that we too can become pregnant with god
1850150 it seemed logical to begin with the annunciation and the very first poem

1850169 there are a large number of issues with the knol service ranging from accountability authenticity to credibility and general seo concerns what they all stem from is that google has in essence created a toolset thats ripe for abuse and given those with no scruples financial incentive to abuse it
1850170 so optimistic as to the potential depravity of human behavior that it borders on ignorance
1850171 on the internet you must imagine all the negative possible uses for your product when you design it for mass consumption

1850174 the meteors are formed when the earth passes through the orbit of the swift tuttle comet
1850175 essentially a comet is a dirty snowball and when it passes the sun the ice turns to gas and releases dust particles if the earth passes through a comets orbit those particles are swept up into our atmosphere as they are moving at about 20 000 miles an hour they have a lot of energy and it makes them glow

1850177 first find somewhere dark away from street lights if possible if youre in a city then head to the east side so youre not looking over the citys lights then you want to look towards the constellation of perseus in the east of a clear night sky after midnight

1850185 it seemed to have a very good prospect of escaping two big problems that all wave power devices have to face
1850186 the anaconda escapes that because you can achieve similar resonance by making the speed of the bulge wave the natural speed of the bulge wave in the tube match the speed of the water waves outside
1850187 we could see the first full size device deployed off the uk coast in around five years time
1850188 they have to think very seriously how well this will cope with very large waves which occur now and then

1850240 sometime i think of abraham how one star he saw was there for me he was a stranger in that land and i am that no less than he
1850241 why does abram go journeying with this strange new god perhaps its because hes heard a voice thats so different so attractive think of it unlike the unknowable gods this god has pursued
1850242 god is beginning the reclamation of planet earth and he goes about it by growing a relationship with one man and this will change everything
1850243 sarah tell them youre my sister so they wont hurt me
1850244 are you serious are you planning on getting rid of the good people right along with the bad what if there are fifty decent people left in the city will you lump the good with the bad and get rid of the lot wouldnt you spare the city for the sake of those fifty innocents i cant believe youd do that kill off the bad and the good alike as if there were no difference between them doesnt the judge of all the earth judge with justice

1850252 there is an ancient jewish tradition that argues that god never wanted abraham to kill isaac and was hoping that abraham would argue with god and ultimately refuse to carry out the directive
1850253 now abraham i want you to know me well enough to know i wouldnt have you do this and i want you to love your son well enough to bring the issue to me and wrestle it through like you did for sodom come on abraham youre growing now bring your growing home where it matters most why be a hero to strangers and freeze up when those you love most are at risk why not get enough of god that you grow relationships with them like im growing with you why not share this with sarah like i shared with you before i destroyed sodom why not plead with me all the way to moriah like you did when i shared my plans with you before why not act like what you know about me
1850254 sometime i think of abraham how one star he saw was there for me he was a stranger in that land and i am that no less than he and step by step hell lead me and i will follow him all of my days

1850451 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all developed nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws the trial will not create finality the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world this case was the first trial run of the commissions system and the decision proves nothing except that the system itself should be scrapped terrorism related crimes should be tried in the time tested domestic criminal justice system a system whose rules have been designed over the centuries with one goal to seek out the truth

1850455 this year in december the dike broke and a whole lot more water got in here than usual
1850456 the problem is that this is agricultural land thats had 75 years of fertilizer application so lots of nutrients in this water that theyre pumping into the tualatin river and the downstream problem is that when we got the warm weather combined with all these nutrients we got these algae blooms
1850457 im standing now above the pipe thats actually taking the water out of wapato lake and into the tualatin river and you can see from here that the color of the water is yellowish brown as it goes into the very brown looking river and there are certainly dotted throughout the water here dead fish and dead frogs as well
1850458 and oregon department of agriculture is supposed to enforce the tualatin basin water quality rules for agriculture and one of those rules says that youre not supposed to be putting waste water thats polluted into another body of water and they havent been enforcing that
1850459 while wapato lake might have contributed to that high water in other parts of the basin may also have contributed to taste and odor problems
1850460 we will be talking with folks at wapato lake and trying to understand how different this year was from last year and we will be looking at developing a management plan into the future to deal with some of these kinds of issues
1850461 they have one piece of property out here and theyre trying to acquire more they have a long term plan to do that definitely a century from now i would expect that theres not farming here that theres a wildlife refuge but thats going to take some time
1850462 the lord has blessed kcbi because we dont manage the station to seek the approval of men
1850463 we only seek the approval of our lord jesus christ
1850464 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you

1850468 thing earlier today i heard a ginormous scream of agony from the front room when i walked into the room one kid was on the floor while the other was sitting on the couch laughing i screamed in my best drill sergeant voice asking what had happened
1850469 know that the life of this world is only an idle talk pageantry and boasting among you and rivalry in respect of wealth and children as the likeness of vegetation after rain whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman then it becomes straw
1850470 this world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the unbeliever
1850471 there is no real living except the living of the hereafter
1850472 aishah the wife of the prophet said sometimes no fire was burned in the house of the prophet for three months we only ate during this time dates and drank water in addition to some gifts of milk we occasionally received
1850473 say who hath forbidden the adornment of allah which he has brought forth for his bondmen and the good things of his providing say such on the day of resurrection will be only for those who believed in the life the world
1850474 o mankind eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth and follow not the footsteps of the devil
1850475 saying eat of the good things where with we have provided you
1850476 o ye who believe forbid not the good things which allah has made lawful to you and transgress not o allah loveth not transgressors
1850477 and has made of service into you what were in heaven and whatsoever in the earth it is all from him
1850478 and he is it who hath constrained the sea to be of service
1850479 there cometh forth both from them the pearl and the coral stone 23 these verses say that if these good are
1850480 aishah the wife of the prophet said that some companions of the prophet said we shall not marry women and we shall not sleep in bed the prophet came to know that and said why some people say such and such i fast and breakfast i sleep and keep vigil aqum and i eat meat and marry women this is my way of life and those who dont like my way of life are not my followers
1850481 but seek the abode of the hereafter in that which allah has given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world and be thou kind even as allah has been kind to thee and seek not corruption in the earth o allah loveth not corruption
1850482 it will be worth what were spending if only one person gets saved
1850483 is it worth it if only one person gets saved
1850484 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home create new ones
1850485 this change is leading to a new surge in hope
1850486 i was proud of him for making a decision like that
1850487 he tried to find the best in whatever situation he was in
1850488 all of our thoughts and prayers go out to his family
1850489 he will be missed by the community that surrounds st charles west
1850490 after all why would an 18 year old young man enter the marines if there werent some sort of sense of duty and some sense of love for what is right burning in his soul especially when he knew that there was a chance that he may never return home
1850491 we honor him today and we salute him today for answering that call to service to duty and to love
1850492 in my day we had to run up 35 degree inclines in the snow carrying 340lbs
1850493 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1850494 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1850495 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1850496 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1850497 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy

1850552 since tiger airways started flying to perth we have seen the route warmly embraced by australians wanting the real deal when it comes to flying before tiger airways came along it was cheaper for travellers to go overseas than to get around their own country it was a disgraceful situation but tiger airways low fare revolution has changed that
1850553 dont ask what the world needs ask what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
1850554 sometime i think of abraham how one star he saw was there for me he was a stranger in that land and i am that no less than he
1850555 why does abram go journeying with this strange new god perhaps its because hes heard a voice thats so different so attractive think of it unlike the unknowable gods this god has pursued
1850556 god is beginning the reclamation of planet earth and he goes about it by growing a relationship with one man and this will change everything
1850557 sarah tell them youre my sister so they wont hurt me
1850558 are you serious are you planning on getting rid of the good people right along with the bad what if there are fifty decent people left in the city will you lump the good with the bad and get rid of the lot wouldnt you spare the city for the sake of those fifty innocents i cant believe youd do that kill off the bad and the good alike as if there were no difference between them doesnt the judge of all the earth judge with justice
1850559 ok if i find fifty decent people ill spare the place just for them
1850560 for the sake of only ten i wont destroy the city
1850561 take your dear son isaac whom you love and go to the land of moriah sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that ill point out to you
1850562 stay here with the donkey the boy and i are going over there to worship then well come back to you
1850563 we have flint and wood but wheres the sheep for the burnt offering
1850564 son god will see to it that theres a sheep for the burnt offering
1850565 dont lay a hand on that boy dont touch him now i know how fearlessly you fear god you didnt hesitate to place your son your dear son on the altar for me
1850566 there is an ancient jewish tradition that argues that god never wanted abraham to kill isaac and was hoping that abraham would argue with god and ultimately refuse to carry out the directive
1850567 now abraham i want you to know me well enough to know i wouldnt have you do this and i want you to love your son well enough to bring the issue to me and wrestle it through like you did for sodom come on abraham youre growing now bring your growing home where it matters most why be a hero to strangers and freeze up when those you love most are at risk why not get enough of god that you grow relationships with them like im growing with you why not share this with sarah like i shared with you before i destroyed sodom why not plead with me all the way to moriah like you did when i shared my plans with you before why not act like what you know about me
1850568 sometime i think of abraham how one star he saw was there for me he was a stranger in that land and i am that no less than he and step by step hell lead me and i will follow him all of my days
1850569 we are absolutely committed to taking all the necessary measures to protect the mountain gorillas and bring security to the people living around virunga national park the new team that we have appointed is a major step toward achieving this goal
1850570 the intensity of the conflict in and around the park makes this a daunting challenge but it is a great privilege to be working alongside such a dedicated and courageous team of rangers i have real confidence in our ability to secure a future for the park to ensure that it makes a positive contribution to the lives of the people of north kivu

1850575 it does hurt our competitiveness because it makes our operations more expensive

1850580 forty eight states now carry it as a felony crime
1850581 but law enforcement is slow to pick up on how to investigate these cases
1850582 the smart animal fighters are going to either drop out or move to misdemeanor states
1850583 dog fighting is still a misdemeanor in idaho and wyoming
1850584 they drag out until anybody who would testify is gone people retire people get transferred the employee goes off on vacation and the trial comes up
1850585 i came from memphis and i had cases there that lasted for years
1850586 and by the time the next prosecutor comes along the new junior person doesnt have any experience in animal cases
1850587 when youre talking about dog fighting youre generally talking about criminal elements a lot of drugs a lot of gang members
1850588 when youre talking about cockfighting more of that is cultural with the hispanic population
1850589 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner
1850590 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
1850591 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
1850592 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
1850593 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
1850594 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins
1850595 and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth
1850596 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
1850597 this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
1850598 the wicked are always placing god on trials to cover their own rejection of god
1850599 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god

1850602 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1850603 on the basis of a specific input on cattle smuggling along river ganga padma on the night of july 17 18 2008 the 108th battalion of the bsf noted movement of cattle and their smugglers in the area of border outpost nimtita malda sector of west bengal the bsf river wing pursued the cattle smugglers who were travelling in boats in indian territory these smugglers fired at the bsf upon which bsf retaliated during this exchange of fire one bsf constable sustained serious bullet injuries
1850604 a flag meeting between local bsf and bdr commanders held on july 18 decided to refer the matter to higher authorities after detailed investigation the results of which would be shared between the two sides
1850605 the local official in murshidabad district said the bangladesh rifles bdr men opened fire when guards of the border security force bsf were chasing cattle smugglers at nimtita area forcing them to retaliate
1850606 the report i have received from the deputy inspector general dig bsf is that there was some trespass from the international border from the bangladesh side there were two to three causalities of bdr and some soldiers have been injured i have asked the dig bsf to give me detailed report for onward transmission to the government
1850607 bangladesh underscores the fact that it views the action of the bsf as totally unacceptable
1850608 indian authorities will take appropriate action against those responsible and ensure that such incident will not recur
1850609 it is unacceptable that 73 bangladeshi civilians have been killed this year by indian border guards i told my counterpart external affairs secretary shiv shankar menon that india is our friendly neighbour such huge number of the civilians killing is unacceptable
1850610 we are interested in transit and we will remain so
1850611 this is not a political issue at all it is an economic issue i dont see any reason why it should be politicised to this extent
1850612 on the basis of a specific input on cattle smuggling along river ganga padma on the night of july 17 18 2008 the 108th battalion of the bsf noted movement of cattle and their smugglers in the area of border outpost nimtita malda sector of west bengal the bsf river wing pursued the cattle smugglers who were travelling in boats in indian territory these smugglers fired at the bsf upon which bsf retaliated during this exchanges of fire one bsf constable sustained serious bullet injuries
1850613 cross border crimes like cattle smuggling are a menace for both countries that occasionally cause firing incidents mostly in the night these illegal activities and firing incidents which sometimes lead to regrettable loss of lives on both sides along the border need to be tackled through joint efforts and mechanisms
1850614 in the area of transit transport bangladesh after gaining independence in december 1971 restored the protocol on inland water transit and trade in 1972 which was suspended by the pakistan authorities after the indo pak war of 1965 this protocol allows india to make full use of the most important and cost effective transit operation on as many as eight inland waterway routes india is making the most successful use of the facility as the phenomenal increase in indias transit traffic through bangladesh since 1972 will bear out within saarc cooperation between india nepal bhutan and bangladesh can be more easily enhanced in fact india nepal and bhutan can particularly benefit from the low cost bangladesh inland water transport facilities as the indian experience will confirm there is urgent need for indian consideration to allow nepal bangladesh road transit to operate up to the river heads in bangladesh whereby these two countries can benefit from low cost bangladesh inland water transport and sea ports so a combination of road and water ways through india and bangladesh would enormously benefit the two land locked countries thus lessening the burden on the calcutta port bangladesh has made enormous disproportionate investment in highway construction to enhance inter district connectivity by road perhaps ignoring the full potential of inland water transport which offered relatively low transportation cost on many of the comparable routes nonetheless the standard of its highways remains poor and dangerous compared to the minimum standards adopted for any international highway demand for transit through bangladesh by india nepal and bhutan can be met for a much higher level of traffic if the depth of bangladesh rivers can be increased with cooperation from india there is a possibility that larger vessels can be used at lower unit cost through out the year the withdrawal of waters by erecting barrages across almost all rivers including the ganges has been detrimental for everyone including indias interest in terms of securing year round transit facility from the low cost inland water transport system for bangladesh it upstream withdrawal particularly at farakka has been an economic disaster bangladesh highway system as its very low standard of safety would confirm is not fit for heavy road transit traffic besides the high cost of fuel and steel which are likely to go even higher will make road transport operation increasingly more prohibitive for all the countries apart from the environmental damage the heavy road traffic would inflict on the country bangladesh has no aggregate thus road building based on imported aggregates and bitumen among other imported items will make road transit haulage less viable economically however there are many other technical issues which would need in depth examination by the concerned experts thus for everybodys interest the bangladesh inland water transport system should be urgently revived india can make the most important contribution by releasing not only the agreed upon quantity of water but also by augmenting its discharge
1850615 there are relevant un conventions to which all the concerned countries are parties conceivably a saarc version of a convention allowing for the tir transport international routier carnet and tir carnet du passage en doune may be adopted in the inland waterway transit field which could be undertaken under the auspices of saarc and be applicable in the entire saarc region from bangladesh up to afghanistan in fact up to the whole of central asia a scenario can be envisaged whereby india could be a potential transit and transport bridge between east asia and central asia
1850616 bangladesh is rift ridden country which in the first place has no right to exist
1850617 you know its not as sickeningly sweet as i thought it would be

1850859 we heard stories about karl rove and the black ministers in cuyahoga county urging the black church people to vote against them to vote on the issue to vote on the anti side but that was a state where it was a key state ohio it was the key state
1850860 im not certain it will by the end of the campaign
1850861 the only way that something like that could probably get done in terms of being turned into a big media story would be if you have uh i dont know obamas invited to officiate at a gay wedding or hes the best man you really have to go almost comical in your thinking to see how a story like that would get mainlined into the controversy of the day
1850862 surprise orientation related story has proved anything but hilariously disastrous for the republican party
1850863 as you know better than i late in campaigns sometimes this is used as just a powerful divisive emotional wedge
1850864 i do think mccain himself does not like that kind of a campaign he does not lead with god guns and gays which has sort of been a republican reflex or a conservative reflex in some of their campaigns its not mccains instinct to do that
1850865 now does that mean if were in the last weeks of september into october and its a 50 50 race and youre looking for something to swing west virginia or something to hold ohio that the tone of the campaign wont change thats the unpredictable path were on right now
1850866 george stephanopoulos did something very important when he pushed john mccain for a real answer regarding his statements on adoption by gay parents
1850867 that kind of insistent questioning sends a message that empty sound bites and reliance on catchphrases like quote unquote family values need to be challenged and it suggests that those who take their responsibility as journalists seriously will dig deep and push for meaningful engagement on these issues
1850868 i just believe in the unique status of marriage between a man and a woman and i know that we have a respectful disagreement on that issue
1850869 rob the push to ban gay marriage seems like a cynical ploy to win votes from a base that is not energized in an election year
1850870 my term not their term but gay bashing or an offensive push off tone to a campaign will not help you among suburban voters more educated voters
1850871 marijuana is illegal it is a crime to possess sell grow or give it to someone fines imprisonment and a criminal record can restrict travel and employment
1850872 explain how their administrations would work to recognize respect protect and celebrate all loving families in the us
1850873 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
1850874 a little success makes you want to try harder a lot of success makes you want to blow the doors off the competition again which were poised to do with the new intensified infiniti g lineup for 2009

1850887 instruments that tend to stay at a given station for a long time
1850888 am i correct that when you changed the program to account for the missing 20 days in july there was a backward propagation of adjustments filling in for other missing days
1850889 you are good when i was at it i made another adjustment to the program i used to fit 4 harmonics sine cosine with frequencies 1 year through 4 year to describe the average seasonal cycle i changed that to 6 harmonics therefore there will be small systematic differences as a function of time of year in the de seasonalized trend that will be on top of adjustments caused by months in the past during which there were a number of missing days not symmetrically distributed during that month
1850890 presented his trip to africa not as the sincere personal odyssey that the seal pack of journalists following him are describing but as calculated political theater
1850891 you are doing as well as anyone can after a transplant
1850892 life itself is the classroom that god gives us to learn who we are who he is and how we are to become who he created us to be
1850893 people who perservere to succeed in life pay as much attention to their mistakes as they do to their accomplishments they learn from their failed attempts and either try harder the next time or readjust their energies toward a more passionate goal

1850898 given the performance of the market the following few days i hope the prime minister comes back more frequently
1850899 there is some misunderstanding we are not adjourned the talks collapsed last saturday morning ibec put forward its final proposal and it was rejected
1850900 as to whether we end up with a series of industrial disputes is very much in the hands of the employers in two respects firstly they must indicate a much more reasonable approach than last weekend
1850901 secondly they must realise that expecting those on lower than average pay to take on the burden of the economic downturn will not wash
1850902 in its recent update grafton outlined that new irish housing was now less than 10 of total group activity with continued rmi remodelling maintenance and improvement spending helping to mitigate the effects of lower new build in both the uk and ireland
1850903 in the case of ireland the particularly toxic combination of a european central bank interest rate increase and a markedly poorer outlook for the irish public finances gave irish consumers quite a lot to be gloomy about
1850904 in recent years the impact of higher borrowing costs and lower property values has been cushioned at least in part by significant tax cuts
1850905 last month a notably poorer budgetary outlook suggested there was little or no scope for any further cuts and instead raised the threat of rising taxes in coming years
1850906 so the reality of higher borrowing costs and the risk of an increased tax burden left many irish households contemplating a bleaker outlook
1850907 the sharp deterioration in the budgetary position through the first half of 2008 represents an important new negative influence on irish consumer sentiment as budget largesse has contributed forcefully toincreased spending power in recent years
1850908 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1850909 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1850910 the leadership in beijing will almost certainly find his comments irritating or objectionable
1850911 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights
1850912 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions yet change will arrive
1850913 the most difficult sad and unbearable time that any parent could possibly imagine
1850914 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents and have needs
1850915 lack of communication and a void of information particularly as the parent of a missing child is torture
1850916 kate did write to the police she never got anything beyond a formal notification back saying that her letter was being added to the file
1850917 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1850918 this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1850919 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1850920 i watch all of them theyre the biggest events in the world
1850921 part of watching it has been tough but its a lot of its been egging me on to work it out
1850922 im trying to get there im working away to do that but i watched p draig win and the golf he played on that back nine that sunday was sensational after the struggle that hed gone through to be as mentally strong as he was was fantastic to see
1850923 i really enjoyed last week at the bridgestone ive missed the big tournaments its where i want to play and i want to do the same thing again this week
1850924 i have to play really well and if i dont play really well in the next few weeks theres no way i would merit a pick at the end of the day ive got to try and play as well as i can this week and we shall see what happens
1850925 last week i was very calm and relaxed and i wandered around the golf course invariably thats when i play as well as i can when i just hit it and find it and hit it again i dont always get into that way of doing things but thats when i play my best i did it last week and im going to try and do it this week as well and see how it ends up
1850926 i would love for an american to win this tournament
1850927 i expect the europeans to contend here i think that theres going to be a lot of europeans who played ryder cup and have a lot of confidence on this golf course so it would not surprise me one bit if a european won here
1850928 i am pleased by todays decision that the full fourth circuit court of appeals will hear this case for the first time virginia s partial birth infanticide ban was passed into law by an overwhelming majority of our elected representatives in the general assembly additionally it is birth abortion ban that was recently upheld by the united states supreme court i am hopeful that the full court will overturn the earlier divided panel decision and virginia s partial birth infanticide ban will be found to be constitutional

1850988 oh we are ex marketers so we know what your needs are
1850989 the onlything i did was right from day one was talk about it discuss it every day we talked about it every day we discussed it every day we got together we would try to emphasize that we have to be come a team we have to share the ball i know youre the best players in your league but you cant win it going one on one i just verbally stressed it and tried to get them to buy in i can say it until im blue in the face there are other kids that wouldnt have bought in i was just fortunate that i picked 10 guys who bought in
1850990 i didnt know was as good as he was even in practice and scrimmages he showed flashes of that but he never put together the whole package like that he was the whole package scoring rebounding passing defending he did it all i was really surprised in these four days that he had that total package i knew he was good i didnt know he was that good
1850991 we had them last year and we knew what we were getting from them and thats why we had them back theyre solid interior players theyre unselfish they do all the little dirty work they defended theyre leaders we knew what we had in them and we needed that strength in the middle and the leadership they provide they dont care if they scored a point and we needed that
1850992 we knew he was a good shooter in the last three scrimmages he was 3 for 25 and we just kept telling him when youre open stroke it and he never lost his confidence he can really shoot the ball when hes open thats what we were looking from him and he fulfilled that role really well
1850993 everybody told me aaron looks to score every time but i talked to aaron i said i know you can score but weve got scorers on this team we need you to attack the rim and we need you to do a little of the dirty work i didnt know he was as good a shooter as he was he hit big threes in a lot of the games early he plays with a lot of confidence

1851099 well make a determination whether or not the recommendation of the congress that there be a criminal investigation of a particular individual is appropriate but we wont just be looking at that well be looking at whether the facts justify any criminal investigation at this point
1851100 we are not doing any interviews and have no comments at this time
1851101 were nearing the high point of the summer recreation season and we all have to do our best to accommodate one another
1851102 as the states population grows and the use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users
1851103 a fatal hunting accident involving non hunters is extremely rare but that doesnt make it any less tragic
1851104 anything we can do to reduce the risk of another such incident is well worth pursuing
1851105 the safety of all outdoor recreationalists is our primary concern
1851106 the mark selective fishery for chinook around port townsend has been hot since the first week of august
1851107 weve been encouraging anglers to get out while they can
1851108 last saturday aug 2 anglers actually brought more hatchery coho to the ramp at shilshole bay than chinook
1851109 these resident coho provide a nice bonus and sometimes save the day
1851110 they were very active often reversing direction possibly feeding in boundary pass
1851111 some folks are getting their limits but the average has been about one fish per person at both ilwaco and westport
1851112 coho are averaging eight to ten pounds and weve seen some that were pushing the 14 pound mark
1851113 chinook have been averaging up to 15 pounds and weve checked some fish going up to 40 pounds theyre not common but were seeing a few of them
1851114 traditionally chinook catches in that area pick up in august
1851115 people should be starting to catch more coho but the numbers arent there
1851116 anglers are averaging about one fish for every two rods in both areas with the catch almost evenly divided between coho and chinook
1851117 fishing this summer is slower than last year but right now we dont know if the run is just late or the fish are coming in below forecast
1851118 the next two weeks are traditionally prime time for catching chinook in puget sound and people shouldnt miss the opportunity
1851119 buoy 10 often starts slow then ramps up quickly and peaks around late august
1851120 the goal is to target those healthy upriver hatchery stocks which tend to bite well when they first enter the river
1851121 were also expecting a strong return of chinook reared in net pens in select areas throughout the lower river
1851122 all of the new rules are included in the 2008 09 fishing in washington rules pamphlet
1851123 anglers should make a point to check them out before they hit the water
1851124 the immediate benefit is that anglers will have an opportunity to catch and retain marked chinook jacks on a number of rivers
1851125 in doing so theyll actually benefit wild chinook by getting hatchery fish off the spawning grounds
1851126 use large worm tipped flies such as muddler minnows behind flashers dodgers or pop gear
1851127 troll 35 40 feet down in water between 75 and 110 feet deep and vary your speed bring a cooler and ice to keep your fish fresh in the hot weather
1851128 the lower spokane river has nice rainbows and browns but river anglers need to be aware of catch limits gear restrictions and other rules listed in the fishing pamphlet
1851129 watch for gathering flocks of some songbird species like blackbirds and swallows which include this summers production
1851130 many of these young birds are now flying and will soon be concentrating at staging areas in anticipation of the coming fall migration
1851131 it looks like they had a good hatch this spring
1851132 the fishery will continue on a daily basis until a harvestable quota has been taken but it could close on short notice
1851133 those chinook being caught however are in the 15 to 20 pound range along with sockeye up to four pounds
1851134 most anglers use a trolled herring or super bait packed with tuna fish just remember that once the daily limit of two adult salmon is retained you can not continue to fish for salmon
1851135 fly fishermen are doing well on hopper patterns and stimulators
1851136 this is a catch and release fishery only under selective gear rules
1851137 there are lots of small mammals like hoary marmots columbian ground squirrels pikas and golden mantled ground squirrels
1851138 theres also the possibility of seeing ptarmigan in their camouflage coloration if you look carefully mountain goats and bears are also occasionally seen
1851139 walleye are being caught in lake umatilla from plymouth to boardman
1851140 the hanford reach has produced some excellent catches this year as has the columbia and snake rivers around the tri cities area
1851141 be prepared for bugs especially mosquitoes and for more than usual amounts of snow at the highest elevation lakes
1851142 i encourage anglers to limit harvest and practice catch and release except at those lakes that are over populated with eastern brook trout or where they want to eat a couple of fish in camp
1851143 for catch and release fishing i like to use a fly and bubble place a plastic float bubble above a swivel attach about five feet of two pound test leader and tie on a small size 12 14 fly flies that imitate mayflies and caddisflies including a variety of bead head nymphs can be very effective i discourage people from releasing bait caught trout because survival of released fish is poor compared to those caught on flies and lures
1851144 kokanee are being caught in yakima basin reservoirs particularly at rimrock reservoir
1851145 mackinaw or lake trout are present in cle elum reservoir although reservoir water levels are higher than normal this late in the season they will be dropping rapidly the rest of this summer
1851146 the reserve is closed to actual entry but you can drive by and look
1851147 the elk cows and calves are grouped up at this time of year and its common to see groups of 50 to 100 elk its a nice time of year to be up there it tops out at 5 300 feet in elevation so its cooler on these hot summer days
1851148 these modifications are part of a broad conservation effort to re tool hatchery programs in the columbia river basin
1851149 the goal is to change hatchery operations to support naturally spawning salmon and steelhead populations while continuing to provide sustainable fisheries that benefit communities along the lower river
1851150 this strategic re alignment of our hatchery operations and production is part of that broad based effort to restore naturally spawning salmon and steelhead populations in the columbia river to productive levels
1851151 but other actions such as restoring habitat modifying harvest and improving fish passage at dams also need to take place if we are going to succeed
1851152 the safety of all people recreating outdoors is our primary concern and our previous hunting safety record is testimony to that ethic
1851153 as the states population grows and use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users we plan to take a look at our own lands and consult with other land managers to see if there are steps we can take to enhance safety for various user groups
1851154 a fatal hunting accident involving a non hunter is extremely rare but that doesnt make it any less tragic
1851155 im personally very sorry that this tragedy has occurred anything we can do to reduce the risk of another such incident is well worth pursuing
1851156 lets get things in order from top to bottom inside and out leaving nothing amiss

1851168 these analyses lay to rest the idea that letting hen harrier numbers increase at langholm meant that other species like curlew lapwing and golden plover were wiped out
1851169 on the contrary populations of some of these species actually rose
1851170 this robust science building on the other important scientific work on langholm in the 1990s provides solid evidence that harriers were not implicated in changes in number of waders

1851182 we are delighted to be able to open the doors of the convention to the public on this historic night
1851183 there is a growing movement for positive change in colorado the west and across the country and what better way to foster it then to have more americans participate in the fourth night of the convention
1851184 thanks to the hard work of the convention staff the denver 2008 convention host committee the city of denver and the support of the obama campaign and the democratic national committee we will be able to ensure that the people of colorado who have helped make this convention possible will be represented in a significant way when barack obama accepts our partys nomination
1851185 when we said we wanted to open the doors of this convention to the community we meant it
1851186 colorado residents have been dedicated partners in making this convention a reality now we want to make it easy for them to be a part of this historic night
1851187 i am delighted such a large portion of the seats at invesco field at mile high will go directly to coloradans
1851188 through exciting public programs and civic engagement efforts our goal has always been to bring the convention out into the metro denver community
1851189 now we can bring more of metro denver inside the convention itself the thursday night event at invesco field at mile high is a tremendous opportunity for local residents and we encourage everyone who is interested in attending to contact the colorado campaign for change and take part in this historic process whether you have the opportunity to experience the event firsthand or watch it on television the rocky mountains and the denver skyline will provide a stunning backdrop to this important night of democracy in action
1851190 one of the best ways we can introduce colorado voters to our campaign and our vision for this country is getting them involved in the convention
1851191 we are delighted that the dncc is allocating so many community credentials to our state it will allow colorado voters of all parties who want take a look and a listen to our message of hope the chance to do so in person

1851207 they plot and allah plots and surely allah is the best of plotters
1851208 the harm the people of innovations disbelief or misguidance is greater that the harm of the enemies who wage war on the muslims for if those people conquer the muslim lands they do not corrupt the hearts of the people and the religion that lies within them except afterwards however those people the people of innovation corrupt the hearts from the very beginning
1851209 the innovators of islam and the fabricators of hadith are more harmful than the atheists because the atheists desire to corrupt the religion from the outside and these they desire to corrupt it from within they are like the people of a town who strive to corrupt it from within but the atheists are like those who have surrounded it from the outside so the ones who are inside open up the fortress so they are more evil to islaam than those who do not wear the cloak of islam
1851210 and sit not on every road threatening and hindering from the path of allah those who have iman in him and seeking to make it crooked
1851211 they were like the khawarijj making takfir of anyone who commits a sin
1851212 they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah refuses except that his light should be perfected even though the kafirun hate it
1851213 i believe that we are in a global war against an ism that can be defeated and must be defeated
1851214 the report says that we must have a strategy that is political as much as it is military and that long term success demands the use of all elements of national power diplomacy intelligence covert action law enforcement economic policy foreign aid public policy and homeland defense president bush and the members of his administration could not agree more since the beginning of the war on terror the president has recognized that the war on terror is as much as conflict of visions as a conflict of arms
1851215 radical islam is an ideology and calling it the enemy implies that america is fighting a war not just of national interest but of ideas
1851216 we actually misnamed the war on terror it ought to be called the struggle against ideological extremists
1851217 the overwhelming obligation of our next president is clear make america stronger make america safer and win the death struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism just as american values brought down the berlin wall so will radical fundamentalism fall to the terrible swift power of our ideas as well as our swords
1851218 it is a war of ideas as much as it is a war of arms
1851219 the public is coming to understand that like our long struggle with communism the war on terrorism is a political struggle even more than it is a military war
1851220 its a battle of ideas as much as it is a military battle
1851221 bush has been unable to connect the dots between the terrorists and the rogue nations who grow them because he is reluctant to acknowledge that the war on terrorism is actually a war on radical islamic fundamentalism
1851222 the war on terror is as monumental a struggle as the cold war its outcome will determine whether we and our children live in freedom or in fear it is not as some people think a clash of civilizations radical islamic fundamentalism is not the true face of islam this is a clash between civilization and the enemies of civilization between humanitys best hopes and most primitive fears to destroy our enemy we have to know our enemy we have to understand that we are facing a radical fundamentalist movement with global reach and a very specific plan they are not just out to kill us for the sake of killing us they want to provoke a conflict that will radicalize the people of the muslim world turning them against the united states and the west and they hope to transform that anger into a force that will topple the regions governments and pave the way for a new empire an oppressive fundamentalist superstate stretching across a vast area from europe to africa from the middle east to central asia
1851223 war on terror as previously argued here is an ill conceived and vaporous term terrorism surely is not our enemy it cannot be an enemy because it is not an entity it is a method no we are fighting a very particular enemy militant islam it is a global network of identifiable militias as well as their state and non state sponsors who espouse and support an interpretation of islam that calls for violent jihad against the united states and our allies in the short term that enemy seeks to alter american policy in the long term it would supplant our constitutional order with a caliphate that accords with wahhabist principles that is the enemy
1851224 above all this is not a war against terrorists this definition of the enemy has been most unfortunate it has obscured us from seeing the face of an enemy that must be dealt with the war is caused planned and carried out by specific religious groups within islam they claim and probably justly according to their own lights to be implementing the demands of their religion they have a pious long range purpose to destroy the opponents of allah to make everyone else a believer generally speaking we are so indoctrinated with ecumenism or liberalism that we cannot comprehend how this thinking could be credible even though in the long history of islam its own expansion and consolidation were largely due to such successful military forces
1851225 the overwhelming obligation of our next president is clear make america stronger make america safer and win the death struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism
1851226 five pillars of democracy how the west can promote an islamic reformation
1851227 rival versions of islam are contending for spiritual and political dominance with immense implications for the rest of the world

1851236 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1851237 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1851238 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1851239 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1851240 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1851241 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1851242 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1851243 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1851244 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1851245 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1851246 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them

1851256 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
1851257 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
1851258 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
1851259 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
1851260 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
1851261 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version

1851280 in a preceding part of scripture jesus sending his apostles commanded them to publish his coming but here he seems to give a contrary mandate tell no one amp c but in my opinion it is one thing to preach the christ and another to preach christ jesus for christ is a name of dignity but jesus is the particular name of the redeemer

1851574 fighting scratching and crawling my way out of the gutter with a baby on my back
1851575 passion is everything in fact youve got to be borderline fanatical about what you do
1851576 be bold enough to find the one thing that you are passionate about it might not be what you were trained to do but be bold enough to do the one thing nobody needs to dig it but you
1851577 without passion you have no energy and without energy you have nothing
1851578 all they needed to know is that i would light it up day after day passion is not something you have to talk about people feel it they see it just as clearly as the color of your eyes baby
1851579 ask not what god can do for you ask what you can do for god
1851580 4 out of 5 churches grow by taking people from other churches
1851581 working as a team to turn irreligious people into fully devoted followers of christ
1851582 we had that happen in our town while the towns 10 miles away have nothing seems like a waste of gods resources ministry energies and it shows a disregard for an area that definitely needs a church it also hurts the newness of the plant to the town someones already been there done that i read that the furthest people drive to church is 13 15 miles couldnt pastors of like minds sit down and actually plan out where churches could be planted so the effort is not concentrated in one place while others go wanting
1851583 we are not looking to borrow believers from other churches we are looking to attract those that slept in and missed church
1851584 pastor rick it would be helpful if i could sit down with some others and discuss the implications of your message today you said so much i need to digest it
1851585 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer all the believers were together and had everything in common every day they continued to meet together they broke bread in their homes and ate together and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
1851586 day after day in the temple courts and from house to house they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that jesus is the christ
1851587 aquilla and priscilla greet you warmly in the lord and so does the church that meets at their house
1851588 give my greetings to nympha and the church in her house
1851589 god i know youre there i know youre listening to me so ill get right to the point i dont need you i know lots of people are happy and fine and you arent a part of their lives and lately ive just been getting the feeling that i could be like them cut out the extra stuff you know so thanks for everything but i dont need you anymore

1851591 a wonderful place to visit i love the personal touches and theme of your site i wish you the best
1851592 wow you speak both japanese and spanish there arent too many people who can speak more than one language your site shows the two sides of you asian and european really well
1851593 a very interesting blog keep up the good work girl your english is really good the grammer use is really tough even for us who speak english just get through it youre doing great from an old english teacher
1851594 everyone knew everyone else and most of the time had bugger all to say to them so everyone made up all kinds of interesting stories about themselves and at the end of the day you could never quite know who you were dealing with and as you trotted out your own lies as he had done himself so many times you couldnt help wondering whether the person you were talking to wasnt doing exactly the same all those ex professors and former diplomats and cricketing heroes arrived here in the dordogne where nothing was ever checked up on simply because no one could be bothered to do so it wasnt worth it except of course for this writer who remained anonymous to them relishing saying too much about them and not revealing why
1851595 murdering writers could become as everyday as doing the washing up
1851596 look moneys tight right now and there are a lot of potential uses for that money and i think people know where south beach is
1851597 why do you set fire to me you chose me bought me brought me home for this
1851598 no boil nicely dont jump away from the one who makes the fire i dont boil you out of hatred through boiling you may grow flavorful nourishing and united with vital human spirit i dont inflict this suffering out of spite gods mercy precedes his wrath by gods mercy the sick ones suffer it has always been so this is how god creates all that exists without pleasure no creatures would come into being without creatures what could the burning love of the friend consume such sorrow may come that you might wish to be free of this life yet the grace of god will overtake his wrath once you are washed clean in the river of suffering chickpea you fed in the springtime now pain has become your guest entertain him well that he may return home grateful and speak of your generosity to the king instead of your vision of good fortune the one who bestows favor may come to you then all true blessings may be drawn to you ust as abraham commanded his son lay your head before my knife i see in a dream that i must sacrifice you lay your head before gods knife that he may cut your throat like that of ishmael he may cut off your head but only the one that is immune to death such submission is the fulfillment of gods purpose chickpea continue to boil in suffering so that no self may remain in you though once you laughed in the garden of earth you now are the rose of the garden of spirit you now are the eye of spirit once you are torn from the garden of water and earth you may become food and thereby enter the living world become nourishment strength and thought once you were sap now become a lion in the jungle you were born from gods attributes return eagerly to them you came from the cloud and the sun and sky then scattered and ascended to heaven you came as rain and heat you will return into the divine attributes you were part of the sun and the cloud and the stars you became soul and action and speech and thoughts our victory after the checkmate of death gives truth to the words verily in being slain there is life action speech and sincerity become food for angels they climb this ladder to heaven a morsel of food becomes food for humanity rises from its inanimate state and obtains a soul the caravan of spirit travels constantly between earth and heaven join it gladly and freely not bitterly and full of hatred like a thief i speak bitter words to you so you may be washed clean of bitterness the frozen grape thaws in the cold water and leaves its coldness and hardness behind when you endure bitterness your heart will fill with blood like the grape and you will be freed from all bitterness a dog not kept for hunting wears no collar the raw and unboiled are nothing but insipid
1851599 i was once like you part of the earth i drank the fire of self discipline fasting and prayer and became worthy and acceptable to god i boiled long in the world of time and long in the pot of this body from these boilings i grew capable of strengthening the senses i became animal spirit and then became your teacher while inanimate i said to myself you are running about in agitation so that you might be filled with knowledge and the qualities of spirit now that i have become animal spirit let me boil again and pass beyond that state
1851600 when i get a little money i buy books and if any is left i buy food and clothes
1851601 dvd set just imported by acorn media contains a 2004 bbc tribute to paterson that tells of her fairly amazing life growing up bold and british with a total disregard for authority

1851609 i told froggy to be careful and not get eaten by the birds there were these birds that were hovering about and looking suspiciously guilty of making a meal out of froggy i also told him to grow up fast so that he can be a big frog and he wont get eaten so easily
1851610 even president bush thought bias was worth thinking about on january 25 2002 as he walked out of the white house on his way to his helicopter he waved to reporters with his left hand while carrying bias in his right hand the title was facing out toward the white house press corps which i thought was a nice touch
1851611 the president of the united states thought bias was worth reading but the president of cbs news supposedly didnt have time for it i say supposedly because i have no doubt that andrew heyward had already read every single word of bias no doubt whatsoever but this is how they are
1851612 if cbs news were a prison instead of a journalistic enterprise three quarters of the producers and 100 percent of the vice presidents would be dans bitches
1851613 limbaugh and buckley and all those other right wingers everybody to the right of lenin is a right winger as far as the media elites are concerned
1851614 dan practically kissed fidel castro in front of the whole evening news staff when the dictator showed up at cbs news studios on west 57th street in the fall of 1995 so there they were the two media grandees dan and fidel touring the studio where dan does the evening news each night smiling laughing bantering looking like old pals who hadnt seen each other in years dan even gave fidel a nice little gift a baseball bat because fidel as everyone knows loves baseball
1851615 after all to a lot of liberals fidel isnt a communist dictator i mean technically he is the way they see it to describe fidel castro simply as a dictator is so uncool comes to mind
1851616 this was a group that would rather vacation on the dark side of the moon than so much as set foot in a place as unappealing and unsophisticated to them anyway as alabama where they may have to come into contact with it was too painful to say alabamians some of whom actually might not have attended college in the northeast or anyplace else and where you probably couldnt even get a morning edition of the new york times
1851617 imagine too that their neighbors are not highly paid sophisticated new yorkers who like the media elites send their children to expensive private schools in manhattan with the overwhelmingly white sons and daughters of other wealthy sophisticated new yorkers
1851618 but its not just that so many journalists are so different from mainstream america its that some are downright hostile to what many americans hold sacred
1851619 religious people are especially juicy targets in a lot of newsrooms theyre seen as odd and viewed with suspicion because their lives are shaped by faith and devotion to god and an adherence to rigid principles opposition to abortion for one that seem archaic and close minded to a lot of journalists who survey after survey suggest are not especially religious themselves
1851620 the polls say they love affirmative action they think people who are against it are neanderthals at best and downright bigots at worst
1851621 w e wont see stories that ask why after more than thirty years of feminism we still have laws saying that only eighteen year old men have to sign up with selective service in case the government reinstates the military draft young women do not
1851622 if women really earned 59 cents to every mans dollar or whatever it supposedly is now
1851623 a s more and more mothers have opted for work outside of the house over taking care of their children at home and not always for economic reasons the results have been disastrous
1851624 t his absence of mothers from american homes is without any historical precedent and that millions upon millions of american children have been left to fend for themselves with dire consequences
1851625 r unning stories about how badly working mothers children are doing is not going to be popular is it
1851626 but sometimes i get the impression that the media that have helped spread the epidemic of fear would love to spread it just a little more sometimes i get the impression that theyd like to write a headline that shouts aids epidemic takes toll on middle class then it really would be everyones disease not just the disease of junkies and gays and poor black people in the rural south then no one would be safe just as the media have been telling us for so many years and then finally we would all be equal
1851627 not just the disease of junkies and gays and poor black people
1851628 these little strange food reviews are hilarious theyre also getting longer with each new one before you know it well be getting cliffhangers and stuff and story arcs and guest stars
1851629 so joe hows about revealing the spoiler poem line for the daedalus variations

1851634 how would you characterize sheppards respective relationships with the sgc ioa and air force currently are they still hostile and disapproving is he still on the usaf naughty list or has he redeemed himself in their eyes at this point
1851635 was there something being hinted at between ronon and keller during quarantine
1851636 joe do the wraith queens have to touch someone to get them to submit or is it like my kids who play with their food
1851637 well we as viewers certainly dont know kanaan so that point is mute tell me why is mckay the only major character allowed to interact with other characters that we know on a romantic level katie brown in seasons 2 and 3 and now unbelievably keller in seasons 4 and 5

1851646 the only way to protect citizens from a nuclear attack is the total abolition of nuclear weapons
1851647 today here in hiroshima i swear that our country will continue to adhere to the three nonnuclear principles and that we will stand at the forefront of the international community toward the realization of the abolition of nuclear weapons as well as of permanent peace
1851648 we will continue our efforts so that we can assist as many people who are suffering as possible
1851649 because the effects of that atomic bomb still eating away at the minds and bodies of the hibakusha have for decades been so underestimated a complete picture of the damage has yet to emerge
1851650 even leaders previously central to creating and implementing u s nuclear policy are now repeatedly demanding a world without nuclear weapons
1851651 we are delighted to be able to open the doors of the convention to the public on this historic night
1851652 there is a growing movement for positive change in colorado the west and across the country and what better way to foster it then to have more americans participate in the fourth night of the convention
1851653 thanks to the hard work of the convention staff the denver 2008 convention host committee the city of denver and the support of the obama campaign and the democratic national committee we will be able to ensure that the people of colorado who have helped make this convention possible will be represented in a significant way when barack obama accepts our partys nomination
1851654 when we said we wanted to open the doors of this convention to the community we meant it
1851655 colorado residents have been dedicated partners in making this convention a reality now we want to make it easy for them to be a part of this historic night
1851656 i am delighted such a large portion of the seats at invesco field at mile high will go directly to coloradans
1851657 through exciting public programs and civic engagement efforts our goal has always been to bring the convention out into the metro denver community
1851658 now we can bring more of metro denver inside the convention itself the thursday night event at invesco field at mile high is a tremendous opportunity for local residents and we encourage everyone who is interested in attending to contact the colorado campaign for change and take part in this historic process whether you have the opportunity to experience the event firsthand or watch it on television the rocky mountains and the denver skyline will provide a stunning backdrop to this important night of democracy in action
1851659 one of the best ways we can introduce colorado voters to our campaign and our vision for this country is getting them involved in the convention
1851660 we are delighted that the dncc is allocating so many community credentials to our state it will allow colorado voters of all parties who want take a look and a listen to our message of hope the chance to do so in person
1851661 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1851662 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1851663 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1851664 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

1851682 these acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent they are inhuman
1851683 we will use all the means at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice
1851684 existing leak detection techniques such as step testing or acoustic devices require a lot of apparatus and personnel as a result they are very time consuming and costly the new leakage detection feature of bentleys enhanced darwin calibrator identifies the locations and sizes of the leakage holes emulated as emitters that allow water to spurt and seep out at different rates depending on prevailing pressure with the effective and rapid prediction of the most likely leakage locations consulting engineers and water utility owners and operators save time and money by focusing their site investigations on the model predicted leakage areas to test for leakage hotspots using widely available leak detection instruments
1851685 we consider the leakage detection optimization model developed in collaboration with bentley to be a valuable and important tool in reducing leakage and achieving the annual targets that uuw agreed to with the u k s water industry regulator ofwat a particular advantage of this technique is its ability to identify hard to find leaks
1851686 we will be able to double the number of nhs patients treated and they will get seen much more quickly
1851687 if this was the straightforward re nationalisation of a private hospital we would be very pleased
1851688 this is actually a bail out of a failing private hospital and it nails the governments lie that the private sector have got all the answer to running these kinds of services
1851689 existing leak detection techniques such as step testing or acoustic devices require a lot of apparatus and personnel as a result they are very time consuming and costly the new leakage detection feature of bentleys enhanced darwin calibrator identifies the locations and sizes of the leakage holes emulated as emitters that allow water to spurt and seep out at different rates depending on prevailing pressure with the effective and rapid prediction of the most likely leakage locations consulting engineers and water utility owners and operators save time and money by focusing their site investigations on the model predicted leakage areas to test for leakage hotspots using widely available leak detection instruments
1851690 we consider the leakage detection optimization model developed in collaboration with bentley to be a valuable and important tool in reducing leakage and achieving the annual targets that uuw agreed to with the u k s water industry regulator ofwat a particular advantage of this technique is its ability to identify hard to find leaks
1851691 the operational performance of the group was in line with that of the previous year

1851693 the decisions taken by the victorian government in april 2008 have a material impact on the group
1851694 as a consequence the board has determined to take a provision for the value of the licence refund we believe this to be prudent but it should in no way be seen as a change in our strong resolve to pursue legal entitlement to the refund

1851696 in the second half we have seen that higher interest rates and higher living expenses are starting to affect discretionary spending particularly in our casinos business

1851704 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1851705 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
1851706 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness

1851711 you can understand that in a way but cristiano knows more than anybody that he is very happy here
1851712 he has always been happy here and there is never a complaint about manchester united he has always been treated properly and the players have had a great relationship with him

1851726 a photograph is not only an image an interpretation of the real it is also a trace something directly stenciled off the real
1851727 exclusion of human bias and no human intervention in the process of creating the bond between a photograph and reality
1851728 by the way of the purpose he has in mind
1851729 for many artists truth had really been another word for convention
1851730 do indicators of time such as clocks and shadows seem consistent with each other do some objects seem surprisingly light or dark in relation to their surroundings are there shadows that do not seem to be cast by any object
1851731 what if a pattern or texture is extracted and reused in production of computer synthesized perspective rendering of a building
1851732 images are no longer guaranteed as visual truth or even as signifiers with stable meaning and value and we endlessly print more of them
1851733 some devout men buried stephen and made loud lamentation over him
1851734 and for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
1851735 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle
1851736 fear of displacement of familiar nature by a fire snorting machine with
1851737 flow of data permeating and leaving no part of us untouched
1851738 television is directing our energy inward and people are looking seriously within themselves as they are oriented to an invisible world
1851739 stresses images that high light role playing rather than an individual identity
1851740 suburbia is in bonanza land and we are on a backward march into the future
1851741 we miss the kaabah and masjidil haram we put that place on a pedestal and we sanctify the place but we neglect to sanctify the baitullah in ourselves qalbu mukmim baitullah the heart of a mukmin is the house of allah if we clean our hearts and take good care of it wherever we go we would feel at peace masjidil haram is sanctified because allah is constantly being mentioned and glorified we should first do that in our own baitullah our hearts what is there at masjidil haram the serenity ketenangannya the satisfaction amp sweetness of worship kepuasan amp kemanisan ibadahnya a place that allah showers his rahmah amp barakah when allah showers his rahmah amp barakah it is safe from disaster calamity and also a place that is loved by all yang selamat dari bencana amp tempat yang disenangi if we put in effort to make our hearts a proper baitullah well get to enjoy all this the serenity the satisfaction of worship we are safe from calamities and everyone is at ease with us defeat the ego opportunities are many allah has already prepared them all we have to do is pass the tests analogy 30 secs without oxygen we are dysfunctional gt become vege 30 secs without allah remembrance of allah gt we our hearts become vege half dead 30 secs without allah our jasad body is not dead even happier even more laughter even more food consumed but theres a completely different effect on our hearts that is why sufis say that a second of not remembering allah is considered a maksiat

1851744 a s video and computer animation become more prevalent and we see our images reproduced more often we venture further into the illusion that the reproduction is the truer self
1851745 we become increasingly fascinated with self improvement and super human qualities when contemplating our image in video our instinct is to reach for the refresh button
1851746 surveillance is so much part of our lives that we dont need to see it to recognize its presence
1851747 not only do we find ourselves mimicking this process of information hiding by censoring our thoughts and gestures in real time but we facilitate the paradigm which enables other to construct our individual and collective identities
1851748 will receive information and process that information based on parts given
1851749 so how does one reconcile using digital technology as an art medium when they are intrinsically related to the facilitation of information as industry as property
1851750 suddenly there is utility in the skills that are taught at art school has this happened before other than the renaissance
1851751 no its not sigma is known for varying qc control

1851758 het continent is toch helemaal afgesloten hoe ben je er binnen gekomen
1851759 ik ben eerst naar de canarische eilanden gevlogen en heb toen via vrienden contact gelegd met een visser uit senegal we hebben elkaar halverwege op de atlantische oceaan ontmoet er werd door de spaanse en marokkaanse marine wel hevig gepatrouilleerd maar omdat het stikdonker was wisten we alle blokkades te omzeilen
1851760 de straten waren roodgekleurd van het bloed er hing voortdurend een penetrante lijkenlucht ik heb daar nog maar weinig levenden gezien mijn hele reportage uit senegal bestaat uit fotos van lijken alle medische teams van de verenigde naties hadden senegal inmiddels verlaten en waren doorgetrokken naar mali
1851761 was je niet bang om ook ge nfecteerd te raken met het virus
1851762 natuurlijk wat dacht je het viel ook niet mee om te fotograferen met een zuurstofmasker op ik heb ook mijn gesmokkelde medicijnen eerst zelf ingenomen en toen ik merkte dat ik niet ziek werd wist ik dat ze zouden helpen helaas hebben deze medicijnen veel mensen te laat bereikt
1851763 wat heb je aangetroffen in mali en hoe ben je teruggekomen
1851764 in mali zag de situatie er een stuk beter uit via raketdroppings hadden de medicijnen de bevolking bereikt en heel oost mali was al virusvrij uiteindelijk ben ik in cairo terecht gekomen en wist itali te bereiken dankzij de hulp van enkele egyptische collegas
1851765 ja want als het europa zou bereiken zijn de gevolgen niet te overzien
1851766 dus de enige veilige plek zou niet meer de aarde zijn maar de maan
1851767 ja paul maar helaas is daar op dit moment nog maar plaats voor tien miljoen mensen bovendien heeft de melkwegvervoersmaatschappij niet in staat om in een korte tijd zoveel mensen naar de maan te vervoeren gezien het grote gebrek aan ruimteschepen

1851775 a rtists have known for a long time that audiences determine the meaning of their work
1851776 artists main day to day routines are focused on data processing
1851777 the broadest public seeks conformity and order fields of data that march
1851778 where there are seemingly lots of choices there is little difference
1851779 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy

1851781 god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
1851782 how are we that are dead to sin live any longer therein
1851783 shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid
1851784 what you wrote is true to a certain extent but there is a point to where if you keep on sining knowing its wrong you will not get forgiven

1851798 concentration of power in the executive branch puts personal liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials an incursion the constitutions three part system is designed to avoid
1851799 who cares how far you have to kick your wallet when you drop it in key west or why hitler killed himself after getting his gas bill
1851800 this outcome was predetermined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
1851801 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
1851802 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1851803 fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review
1851804 the framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom
1851805 the practice of arbitrary imprisonments in all ages is the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny

1851809 but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
1851810 and ye shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god i am the lord
1851811 but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation
1851812 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne
1851813 and take thou unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of israel that he may minister unto me in the priests office even aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar aarons sons
1851814 and the lord said unto moses speak unto the priests the sons of aaron and say unto them there shall none be defiled for the dead among his people but for his kin that is near unto him that is for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother and for his sister a virgin that is nigh unto him which hath had no husband for her may he be defiled but he shall not defile himself being a chief man among his people to profane himself they shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh they shall be holy unto their god and not profane the name of their god for the offerings of the lord made by fire and the bread of their god they do offer therefore they shall be holy they shall not take a wife that is a whore or profane neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto his god thou shalt sanctify him therefore for he offereth the bread of thy god he shall be holy unto thee for i the lord which sanctify you am holy and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing the whore she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on the garments shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes neither shall he go in to any dead body nor defile himself for his father or for his mother neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the crown of the anointing oil of his god is upon him i am the lord and he shall take a wife in her virginity a widow or a divorced woman or profane or an harlot these shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife neither shall he profane his seed among his people for i the lord do sanctify him and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron saying whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish he shall not approach a blind man or a lame or he that hath a flat nose or any thing superfluous or a man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded or crookbackt or a dwarf or that hath a blemish in his eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his stones broken no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire he hath a blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god he shall eat the bread of his god both of the most holy and of the holy only he shall not go in unto the vail nor come nigh unto the altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries for i the lord do sanctify them and moses told it unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of israel
1851815 it is truly sad to see any of that race in league with satan
1851816 and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye
1851817 and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him
1851818 and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
1851819 and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not
1851820 and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ
1851821 and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour
1851822 and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time
1851823 and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god
1851824 and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
1851825 o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
1851826 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy
1851827 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden
1851828 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ
1851829 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
1851830 it is clear from our text that our defense and our conquest must be obtained by sheer fighting
1851831 get up and go south to the road that descends from jerusalem to gaza
1851832 he was led as a sheep to slaughter and as a lamb before its shearer is silent so he does not open his mouth
1851833 please tell me of whom does the prophet say this of himself or of someone else
1851834 i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
1851835 do you not even fear god since you are under the same sentence of condemnation
1851836 and we indeed are suffering justly for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong
1851837 truly i say to you today you shall be with me in paradise
1851838 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household
1851839 i am jesus whom you are persecuting it is hard for you to kick against the goads
1851840 arise and go into the city and you will be told what you must do
1851841 arise and go to the street called straight and inquire at the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he is praying and in a vision he has seen a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him so that he might receive his sight
1851842 lord i have heard from many about this man how much harm he has done to your saints in jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name
1851843 go for he is a chosen vessel of mine to bear my name before gentiles kings and the children of israel for i will show him how many things he must suffer for my names sake
1851844 brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on the road as you came has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the holy spirit
1851845 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up at the last day
1851846 that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead you will be saved for with the heart one believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
1851847 then saul arose from the ground and when his eyes were opened he saw no one
1851848 and ananias went his way and entered the house and laying his hands on him he said
1851849 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
1851850 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new
1851851 then saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord
1851852 immediately he preached the christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
1851853 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become sons of god to those who believe in his name
1851854 the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if indeed we suffer with 16 joint heirs with jesus
1851855 beloved now we are children of god and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be but we know that when he is revealed we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
1851856 examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith test yourselves do you not know yourselves that jesus christ is in you unless indeed you are disqualified
1851857 these things i have spoken to you that in me you may have peace
1851858 adulterers and adulteresses do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of god
1851859 if corpses cant be raised then christ wasnt because he was indeed dead and if christ werent raised then all youre doing is wandering about in the dark as lost as ever its even worse for those who died hoping in christ and resurrection because theyre already in their graves

1851952 hed begun inquisitively but she silenced him by putting one slender finger to his lips they had waited with the wail of the city droning in the background
1851953 he had mumbled barely containing a sudden wave of nausea that twisted through the peace that had blanketed him one hundred twenty miligrams of a generic brand opiate rested in a perfect pile of pale dust before logan sighing he finished his fifth cigarette of the morning inhaling the bitter sweet scent of clove as he pursed his lips and gave a pensive sigh blowing grey wraiths over the desk logan fancied that the smoke wound its way out of the open window to mingle with the rain he placed the smoldering butt of his cigarette in a well built pile near the white cup that continually held a supply of lukewarm black coffee one ringed finger on his right hand tapped idly seven weeks later logan was railing 80 milligram doses of percocet as he lay down to avoid the ever decreasing nausea that seemed to accompany his intoxications logan prepared to force image and shape into the shining whiteness that threatened him he had developed a fear of simply drifting off while using any narcotic the white void terrified him he was fascinated by the faint voices that seemed to reach to him but he could not help but feel a terrible fear of their source the third time he had used percocet he had deliberately set himself into a place of infinite black and had been equally petrified if the whiteness had seemed ominous this pitch abyss was triply so he had jolted out of the half dream like state screaming only to throw up the very narcotics that lead him to the dark kingdom dimly the young man recalled what sandra had described to him as the kingdom he had understood what she said the glory that he felt almost overpowering and the attraction the lure however he did not find the kingdom in this bright haze rather he caught glimpses of it in a spark of electricity in arcane formations of smoke in the lights reflecting off of broken windows in the back alleys of new york pushing these thoughts aside he desperately threw images into the whiteness as he noticed his body slipping away again floating into white he saw bubbles of blue and green shimmering joyfully in the stark void buoying him surrounding him the part of logan that was still corporeal smiled while the incorporeal brushed at the iridescent bubbles all about him thunder rumbled menacingly outside of logans window breaking his reverie as lightning flashed before his eyes touching down on some rusting tenement in the distance logan gasped the kingdom ever before his eyes seemed so palpable in moments such as this that he felt that a single step would carry him through its gates as the lighting and the striking nearness of the kingdom faded logan redirected his attention to a string of creamy pearls that lay in a careless heap in one corner of his desk blankly staring at them he downed most of his cup of coffee weeks later after taking a light dosage of percocet logan slipped away from sandra in the late afternoon and went for a walk through the alleyways near his rundown apartment his use of the narcotic was necessary for an experiment he wished to perform logan attempted to project his own images onto reality much as he had learned to project into the frightening void of the opium abyss as he walked the altogether ugly and unremarkable city became a mural of decadence a marvel in spoiling grandeur monolithic buildings stretched narrowly up from the mud and muck that was the city floor most windows stood empty of glass some covered by haphazardly nailed boards while ivy and graffiti seemed to grow together on weathered brick walls logan noticed lotus blossoms that dotted the mud of the alleyways where he walked overhead were the gaping crowns of unfinished buildings and the solemn heads of light posts and telephone poles wire stretched from pole to pole humming with power reverberating in that hum logan felt was the kingdom i can see it he thought desperately im so close after another moment of mindless staring logan began carefully scraping the poudre blanche into even piles this achieved after painstaking minutes he neatly filled clear gelatin caps with the oxycodone he found concentration difficult the dismal alley scene through his window kept dragging at his eyes and attention eventually logan gave up and stared out his window at the ancient slums the clusters of apartments and tenements appeared dull through the dank rain that dropped sluggishly to the ground logan sighed so much potential beauty in the world and so many ugly realities he sipped enjoying the harsh grating of a new brew coffee against his dry mouth savoring the flavor and appreciating the caffeine blowing out a heavy breath logan leaned further forward over his desk peering out of the window at the streets below the sewer entries were full clustered with mud and debris oil and filth from the city gave the street an eerie raven sheen in the rain atop of the glistening rainbow film on the streets he could see a reflection of the dark clouds above another sip of coffee he could feel the opiate working its way through his system the rain drops that collected on the window sill reflected the outside lights in glistening shades of blue and green logan stared at them with fascination seeing the whole world colored through their translucence lavender and musk incense glowing dimly in the corner of his desk sent strange phantasms dancing across the air logan watched their movements following the wisps with his inner eye as they faded into the dank air every day became another step on the road to the kingdom each increasing dosage allowing him just a little more of a glimpse even sandra at first so eager to push him to pursuit of the kingdom worried for him with his persistent search for the ultimate key eventually he began disregarding her cautions and warnings turning his back to his love in favor of the kingdom high dose after high dose followed in quick succession abnormally close together and in increasing volumes logans eyes already surrounded by dark circles took on a dull glazed look in his sunken sockets ringed with bruises grapefruits replaced all other food in his diet and his frame thinned out joints and bones bulging under fragile skin his shirts barely clung to his frame leering open between buttons to reveal dull skin and a fragile chest logan however did not notice the change but pursued life with his normal quietly optimistic attitude and all the more he pursued the kingdom nothing for it

1852045 big box retailers are suffering as customers balk at driving to the mall
1852046 this is an illusion this person is created divine and whole and loved by god as is each being on this planet
1852047 when you wake up to the divine consciousness within you and your divine identity you wake up simultaneously to the divine consciousness appearing as all other beings and this is not poetry and this is not a feeling this is a direct experience of the divine light living in and as all other beings and until this realization is firm in you you do not know who or where you are you do not know that you are god in disguise and you do not know that you have been born into a totally sacred totally holy creation in which all sentient beings from the smallest flea to the largest whale are nothing less than god herself and this has to be the core realization for a future humanity because only from a realization of the divine identity of all things can grow the kind of humility the kind of tenderness the kind of wonder the kind of awe and the kind of respect that are necessary for human beings to live in peace with each other for human beings to live in balance with their environment and for human beings really to work with the divine forces of love and knowledge to recreate the world in the image of god
1852048 there is a lantern in the soul which makes your solitude luminous solitude need not remain lonely it can awaken to its luminous warmth the soul redeems and transfigures everything because the soul is the divine space when you inhabit your solitude fully and experience its outer extremes of isolation and abandonment you will find that at its heart there is neither loneliness nor emptiness but intimacy and shelter in your solitude you are frequently nearer to the heart of belonging and kinship than you are in your social life or public world your persona beliefs and role are in reality a technique or strategy for getting through the daily routine when you are on your own or when you wake in the middle of the night the real knowing within you can surface you come to feel the secret equilibrium of your soul when you travel the inner distance and reach the divine the outer distance vanishes ironically your trust in your inner belonging radically alters your outer belonging unless you find belonging in your solitude your external longing will remain needy and driven there is a wonderful welcome within meister eckhart illuminates this point he says that there is a place in the soul that neither space nor time nor flesh can touch this is the eternal place within us it would be a lovely gift to yourself to go there often to be nourished strengthened and renewed the deepest things that you need are not elsewhere they are here and now in that circle of your own soul real friendship and holiness enable a person to frequently visit the hearth of his solitude this benediction invites an approach to others in their blessedness
1852049 be deep in alignment with the supreme self within allow yourself to be taken into the light and in that moment you will experience peace be the divine child and stand in your own light that you know is your truth allow the glory of the light to expand be in joy be at peace do not hesitate to call on the shakti with your power and love anchor this power of love in the planet raise all your thought forms to your godhood and be wrapped in this devotion nothing else is needed no initiations god god god only god

1852054 why the heck are advertising and marketing agencies so often so late to invest in or experiment with new technologies and emerging media while the marketers and clients demonstrate increasing interest and tendency to pursue them directly

1852130 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected

1852200 i can honestly say even though im going to federal prison for once in my life i have a focus im very sorry for what i did im hoping people can forgive me
1852201 i was miserably going to school i never went to football games or high school dances i was overweight and i would rush home and sit down on my computer and talk to people
1852202 that was the only place i received validation not that that excuses my activities

1852211 hes been rooming with me since the start of summer and im going to put a lot of my time and effort into him but its up to him to take it to the next level
1852212 if you just walked out here and watched practice you wouldnt know he was just a freshman out here for the first time and a lot of that is due to how hard hes worked over the summer
1852213 now all hes got left to do is get used to the speed of practice and learn how to be a division i quarterback
1852214 if youre a quarterback at this level just about everybody has the physical skills
1852215 the thing that sets the great ones apart is the mental aspect of the game i think if i can know the system and be smarter than the guy starting across from me good things are going to happen

1852252 kami akan memasang timbangan yang tepat pada hari kiamat maka tiadalah dirugikan seorang barang sedikit pun dan jika amalan itu hanya seberat biji sawi pun pasti kami mendatangkan pahala nya dan cukuplah kami sebagai pembuat perhitungan

1852260 dan peliharalah dirimu dari api neraka yang disediakan untuk orang orang yang kafir
1852261 sesungguhnya kami telah sediakan bagi orang orang yang zhalim itu neraka yang gejolaknya mengepung mereka jika mereka meminta minum maka mereka akan diberi minuman dengan air seperti besi yang mendidih yang dapat menghanguskan muka itulah minuman yang paling buruk dan tempat istirahat yang paling jelek
1852262 sesungguhnya alloh melaknati orang orang kafir dan menyediakan bagi mereka api yang menyala nyala neraka
1852263 alangkah baiknya andaikata kami taat kepada alloh dan taat pula kepada rasul
1852264 tidak ada asalnya arab laa ashla lahu dan para muhadditsin ahli hadits telah mengerahkan segenap upaya mereka untuk menemukan sanadnya akan tetapi mereka tidak menemukannya
1852265 ucapan ini tidak dikenal di kalangan para muhadditsin dan saya tidak menemukan untuknya sanad yang shohih tidak pula sanad yang palsu
1852266 ini adalah termasuk di antara ucapan yang paling rusak karena jika seandainya perselisihan adalah rahmat maka tentunya persatuan adalah siksaan dan hal ini tentunya tidak akan dikatakan oleh muslim manapun
1852267 yang berhak mengimami suatu kaum adalah yang paling baik bacaannya dan paling banyak hafalannya
1852268 sehingga sholat dengan membaca mushaf tentunya akan menjadikan hadits ini tanpa makna
1852269 orang yang merasa puas bangga dengan apa yang tidak dimilikinya ibarat orang yang mengenakan pakaian kedustaan
1852270 sungguh hebat imam ini hafalannya banyak mutqin kuat hafalnnya dan tidak ada salahnya serta benar bacaannya
1852271 dan apabila mereka berdiri untuk sholat mereka berdiri dengan malas mereka bermaksud riya dengan sholat di hadapan manusia dan tidaklah mereka mengingat allah kecuali sedikit sekali
1852272 sesungguhnya allah memaafkan umatku akan apa yang terbersit di benaknya selama hal itu belum dilakukan atau diucapkan
1852273 janganlah kalian menghilangkan pahala shadaqah kalian dengan menyebut nyebutnya atau menyakiti perasaan si penerima seperti orang yang menafkahkan hartanya karena riya kepada manusia dan dia tidak berimana kepada allah dan hari kemudian
1852274 barangsiapa yang kebaikannya membuat dia senang serta kejelekannya membuat dia sedih maka dia adalah seorang mumin sejati
1852275 yang demikian itu merupakan kabar gembira yang disegerakan bagi seorang mumin
1852276 rasululloh shollallahu alaihi wa sallam telah bersabda iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka dan iedul adha adalah hari kalian menyembelih hewan kurban
1852277 sungguh seandainya kepala kalian ditusuk dengan jarum besi lebih baik daripada dia menyentuh yang tidak halal dia sentuh
1852278 demi alloh tiadalah pernah tangan rasululloh shollallahu alaihi wa sallam menyentuh tangan wanita walau sekali dan tiadalah beliau membaiat kaum wanita kecuali hanya dengan ucapan
1852279 sholat lima waktu dari jumat ke jumat berikutnya dari romadhon ke romadhon berikutnya bisa menghapuskan dosa dosa yang terjadi dintaranya jika dosa dosa besar bisa dihindari
1852280 semoga kita kembali menjadi orang yang fitrah diampuni dosanya dan termasuk orang yang menang
1852281 dari khalid bin madan radhiyallaahu anhu berkata aku menemui watsilah bin al aqsa pada hari ied lalu aku mengatakan taqobbalalla minna wa minka
1852282 ah minta maafnya nanti saja pada saat hari raya toh pasti dimaafkan
1852283 telah sempurnalah kalimat rabbmu al quran sebagai kalimat yang benar dan adil tidak ada yang dapat merubah rubah kalimat nya dan dialah yang maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
1852284 dan dia muhammad tidak berkata berdasarkan hawa nafsu ia tidak lain kecuali wahyu yang diwahyukan
1852285 tulislah demi dzat yang jiwaku berada di tangan nya tidak keluar darinya kecuali kebenaran sambil menunjuk ke lidahnya
1852286 dan apa yang diberikan rasul kepada kalian maka terimalah dan apa yang ia larang maka tinggalkanlah
1852287 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh dan taatilah rasul
1852288 alloh memerintahkan untuk mentaati nya dan mentaati rasul nya sholallohu alaihi wassalam dengan mengulangi kata kerja taatilah yang menandakan bahwa menaati rasul wajib secara independent tanpa harus mencocokkan terlebih dahulu dengan al quran jika beliau memerintahkan sesuatu
1852289 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul setelah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan bukan jalannya orang orang yang beriman maka kami akan biarkan ia leluasa berbuat kesesatan yang ia lakukan dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
1852290 akal merupakan syarat untuk memahami ilmu dan kesempurnaan dalam amal dengan keduanyalah ilmu dan amal menjadi sempurna hanya saja ia tidak dapat berdiri sendiri di dalam jiwa ia berfungsi sebagai sumber kekuatan sama seperti kekuatan penglihatan pada mata yang jika mendapatkan cahaya iman dan al quran ia seperti mendapatkan cahaya matahari dan api akan tetapi jika ia berdiri sendiri ia tidak akan mampu melihat hakikat sesuatu dan jika sama sekali dihilangkan ia akan menjadi sesuatu yang berunsur kebinatangan
1852291 setiap anak yang lahir dalam keadaan fitrah maka kedua orang tuanyalah yang membuat ia menjadi yahudi nasrani atau majusi
1852292 dan apabila kalian ditimpa bahaya di lautan niscaya hilanglah siapa yang kalian seru kecuali dia maka tatkala dia menyelamatkan kalian ke daratan kalian berpaling dan manusia adalah sangat kufur
1852293 orang orang laki laki maupun perempuan yang banyak berdzikir kepada alloh
1852294 maukah kuberitahukan kepada kalian sebaik baik amal kalian sesuci suci kekayaan kalian setinggi tinggi derajat kalian dan apa yang lebih baik bagi kalian daripada menyedekahkan emas dan harta benda atau daripada kalian berjumpa dengan musuh lantas memenggal leher mereka atau mereka memenggal leher kalian
1852295 dan dalam keadaan tertentu melanjutkan dzikir ini dengan tambahan seperti
1852296 sesungguhnya bagi alloh tidak ada satupun yang tersembunyi di bumi dan tidak pula di langit
1852297 kepunyaan allh lah kerajaan langit dan bumi dan apa yang ada di dalamnya dan dia maha kuasa atas segala sesuatu
1852298 hai orang orang beriman penuhilah seruan alloh dan seruan rasul apabila rasul menyeru kamu kepada suatu yang memberi kehidupan kepada kamu dan ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya alloh membatasi antara manusia dan hatinya dan sesungguhnya kepada nyalah kamu akan dikumpulkan
1852299 dan apabila hamba hamba ku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku maka jawablah bahwasanya aku adalah dekat aku mengabulkan permohonan orang yang mendoa apabila ia berdoa kepada ku maka hendaklah mereka itu memenuhi segala perintah ku dan hendaklah mereka beriman kepada ku agar mereka selalu berada dalam kebenaran
1852300 berdoalah kepada rabbmu dengan berendah diri dan suara yang lembut sesungguhnya alloh tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas
1852301 hanya milik alloh asma ul husna maka bermohonlah kepada nya dengan menyebut asma ul husna itu dan tinggalkanlah orang orang yang menyimpang dari kebenaran dalam menyebut nama nama nya nanti mereka akan mendapat balasan terhadap apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
1852302 wahai ar rahman yang maha pengasih kasihanilah kami wahai al ghafur yang maha pengampun ampunilah kami wahai ar razzaq yang maha memberi rezeki berikan rezeki kepada kami
1852303 bukankah aku telah memerintahkan kepadamu hai bani adam supaya kamu tidak menyembah syaitan sesungguhnya syaitan itu musuh yang nyata bagi kamu dan hendaklah kamu menyembah ku inilah jalan yang lurus
1852304 dan janganlah kamu menyembah apa apa yang tidak memberi manfaat dan tidak pula memberi mudharat kepadamu selain alloh sebab jika kamu berbuat yang demikian itu maka sesungguhnya kamu kalau begitu termasuk orang orang yang zhalim
1852305 dan siapakah yang lebih sesat daripada orang yang menyembah sesembahan selain alloh yang tiada dapat memperkenankan doanya sampai hari kiamat dan mereka lalai dari memperhatikan doa mereka
1852306 sesungguhnya alloh tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni segala dosa yang selain dari syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya
1852307 dan orang orang yang kamu seru sembah selain alloh tiada mempunyai apa apa walaupun setipis kulit ari jika kamu menyeru mereka mereka tiada mendengar seruanmu dan kalau mereka mendengar mereka tidak dapat memperkenankan permintaanmu dan di hari kiamat mereka akan mengingkari kemusyrikanmu dan tidak ada yang dapat memberikan keterangan kepadamu sebagai yang diberikan oleh yang maha mengetahui hai manusia kamulah yang berkehendak kepada alloh dan alloh dia lah yang maha kaya tidak memerlukan sesuatu lagi maha terpuji
1852308 look i can go if that will facilitate the conversation

1852312 that which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth in order that we may test them as to which of them are best in conduct
1852313 o mankind we created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other not that ye may despise each other verily the most honored of you in the sight of allah is he who is the most righteous of you and allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted with all things
1852314 those who believe in the quran and those who follow the jewish scriptures and the christians and the sabians and who believe in allah and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve

1852319 if anyone slays a human being unless it be in punishment for murder or for spreading corruption on earth it shall be as though he had slain all mankind whereas if anyone saves a life it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind
1852320 how is it that sometimes you can tell in a movie when someones bad when they havent really done anything bad yet like in the movie sky high i could tell that the girl was a villain even before she came out and told everyone she was
1852321 its a device called foreshadowing where they give you clues to what is going to happen in the movie in advance also you know how in a movie the guy and the girl get together well in sky high there were two girls that the guy liked so you kinda could guess that at the end he would end up with one and for some reason not like the other

1852353 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
1852354 they havent merited much discussion in the presidential campaign nor are we as a nation riveted by the trial of the first defendant instead of a landmark case one that serves as a resonant reminder of the gulf separating us from our enemies we have detachment and ambiguity not just about the extent of hamdans guilt but also about the wisdom of the entire tribunal process as well as many other aspects of the prosecution of the war on terror

1852487 ketika muncul dalam berita para muslilm amerika selalu berpakaian dalam jubah timur tengah
1852488 saya teringat suatu ceramah yang saya hadiri di sebuah universitas sewaktu pertama kali saya tertarik dengan islam pembicaranya seorang mualaf amerika yang mengenakan busana mirip pakaian saudi arabia terus menerus menyisipkan dalam presentasinya istilah istilah arab yang diucapkan dengan buruk seolah olah segenap khalayaknya akrab dengan istilah istilah itu suasana seperti itu menciptakan begitu banyak kesenjangan dalam pemahaman saya sehingga pembicaraannya bagi saya secara praktis tidak bisa dipahami saya tinggalkan ceramah itu dengan perasaan bahwa untuk menjadi seorang muslim seseorang harus menjadi seorang arab

1852501 over something that happened over 100 years ago that they dont even understand
1852502 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
1852503 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
1852504 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
1852505 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1852506 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
1852507 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction
1852508 recent decades the messages about alcohol have increasingly emphasized the potential to derive both pleasure and health benefits from wine provided the dose is prudent the trends in this study suggest those messages are having an impact at least in framingham massachusetts among those not vulnerable to alcohol abuse intake patterns appear to be shifting in accord with expert recommendations

1852527 there seems to be an overlap here almost a reserve against pelagianism human action and agency do not encroach on what is the divine prerogative but faith reaches down and lifts the person without subject agent free will etc into the divine action of god that is however the furtherance of incarnation or continuous creation

1852574 i believe we may suffer from a darkness deficiency recent findings suggest that there may be beneficial effects associated with time awake in darkened space
1852575 just as light stimulates the release of serotonin which energizes us darkness encourages the production of melatonin the key neurohormone in our night biology sleep and dreams
1852576 excessive light at night along with other features of modern life conversely inhibit melatonin dampening the positive effects of darkness
1852577 our very consciousness is in need of repair like the attention deficit world we live in it is scattered segregated even fragmented sleep and dreams are sharply set apart from waking alhtough fragments of these states now cut and bleed into one another
1852578 we see an epidemic of wakefulness intruding into our sleep and dreams as insomnia the resulting sleep and dream debt seeps back into our wakefulness as the dangerous mental smog of daze we mistake the jittery buzz of counterfeit energies for natural vitality half awake in our sleep and half asleep in our waking we are never completely at rest and seldom fully conscious

1852584 27 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery
1852585 looketh on a woman to lust after her 28 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart

1852587 7 and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me 8 but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand 9 there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god 10 and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her 11 and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within 12 and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out

1852604 i am acting director koorkoon i would like to begin by saying that this is a distinct honor i would like to but lets just stick to the facts according to the report i received the two of you are from a planet called earth of which we seem to have no record from the looks of you two not having a record is something to which you are unaccustomed
1852605 in any event i have been instructed to provide assistance as far as possible its unfortunate but we do not have the personnel to assist you right away the best we can do with current staff will be a wait of approximately eighty one bleems
1852606 your time system would be different let me recalculate in your own idiom
1852607 yes idiom is the word alright lets see it comes out to approximately two years and thirty nine days
1852608 two years what in the name of hell are we supposed to do for two years

1852611 come on mister there has to be a way to speed things up
1852612 now that you mention it there is something you could do as i mentioned before we are quite short handed and we could use a little help your own case raises some interesting problems the appearance of a vortex on an uncharted planet and the fact that it captured you for some reason is most extraordinary its obvious we have a malfunction somewhere we believe we have narrowed it down to three transportation depots we tried sending automated probes to investigate but due to strange interference with all cybernetic systems the automated probes dont seem to work
1852613 i dont know im not sure i want to go anyplace where the septic systems dont work
1852614 no you misunderstand why doesnt that surprise me i mean that the brain part of the robots doesnt work on those planets therefore we need to send living sentient beings to investigate and since you two nearly qualify its a chance to help your own cause and speed things up if you are willing to perform this mission for us i believe i can see my way to have your request put to the front of the line we will do a memory search for earth as soon as you have completed your mission
1852615 well okay then you got a deal sport what do we do and when do we start
1852616 i will arrange for your training to begin tomorrow morning in the meantime we have accommodations here that you may use i think that just about takes care of it ive had a great time but unfortunately meeting you two wasnt it

1852620 now how in the name of cecil b demille do you manage that
1852621 its all done with technology that hasnt yet been invented in your time period apparently but there is nothing magical about it please do not think i am some kind of ghost i am not a person at all i am just a computer simulation understand
1852622 a computer is a device that can approximate in a limited way many of the abilities of the human mind think of it as an electronic brain in some ways it is quite superior to the human mind in other ways it is quite limited but that is not the subject of this session i am here to instruct you about your mission may i proceed

1852793 it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honour of kings is to search out a matter prv 25 2 my favorite verse
1852794 it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink 5 lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted 6 give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts 7 let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more
1852795 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life ministers dos and donts
1852796 these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly 15 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory

1852806 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son
1852807 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
1852808 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit
1852809 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
1852810 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him

1852817 love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
1852818 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
1852819 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now
1852820 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
1852821 know the truth and the truth shall make you free
1852822 for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue
1852823 15 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves 16 ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles 17 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 19 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 20 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
1852824 19now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness 20 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies 21 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith 23 meekness temperance against such there is no law

1852828 master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
1852829 neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him

1852831 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams
1852832 the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen

1852835 so that we can be ready for the next level
1852836 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
1852837 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
1852838 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
1852839 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
1852840 blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be fill

1852844 i want to wait to be sure its a fire
1852845 you need to get started now before its too late please
1852846 i have some friends who were in a fire and they didnt burn up
1852847 for if after escaping the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome their latter state has become worse for them than the former for it were better for them not to have known the way of justice than having known it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them for what that true proverb says has happened to them a dog returns to his vomit and a sow even after washing wallows in the mire
1852848 do you not know that the friendship of this world is enmity with god therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of this world becomes an enemy of god why chance eternal joy for temporal gain
1852849 that gift is wisdom which is the word of god spoken by the servant of god
1852850 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
1852851 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
1852852 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
1852853 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another

1852856 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear

1852889 we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastructure of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
1852890 if you look carefully i do not think that the u s budget is spending on the iraqi economy
1852891 u s money is not being spent at the moment on reconstructing iraq but its spent on services for the u s military its a mutual interest for both countries
1852892 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1852893 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1852894 one of the statements that he relayed to me that his children were in fact told by fbi agents that were doing the interview that their father was a murderer
1852895 and that i could tell greatly disturbed bruce as it would anybody
1852896 the notion that somehow these people were coerced by the agents or the lawyers is categorically false
1852897 these agents handled themselves professionally with great respect for mr ivins and his family and id say the same thing about the prosecutors in the case
1852898 she was manhandled by the fbi upon their entry and not immediately shown the search warrant her apartment was wrecked while fbi agents screamed at her that i had killed five people and that her life would never be the same again she was terrified by their conduct put into isolation for interrogation for eight hours
1852899 instead it was deluged with everything but the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins
1852900 dr ivins was characterized by his commanding officer for his openness sharing humor and curiosity and was lauded for the central role he has played in the protection of the american soldier
1852901 no one who attended that service could believe that dr ivins committed any crime

1852907 the collapse of the internet bubble which chased hot money out of the stock market rock bottom interest rates 50 years of economic history that suggested housing never goes down and creative financing
1852908 lenders have encouraged people to use the appreciation in value of their houses as collateral for an unaffordable loan an idea similar to the junk bonds being pushed in the late 1980s the concept was to use the company you were taking over as collateral for the loan you needed to take over the company in the first place the implosion of that idea caused the 1989 mini crash now the house is the banks collateral for the questionable loan but what happens if the value of the house starts to drop
1852909 in q1 2005 wamu booked 25 million of negative amortization as earnings in the same period for 2006 the number was 203 million
1852910 negative amortization and other short term loans on long term assets dont work because eventually too many borrowers are unable to pay the loans down or unwilling to keep paying for an asset that has declined in value relative to their outstanding balance even a relatively brief period of rising mortgage payments rising debt and falling home values will collapse the system and when the housing finance system goes the rest of the economy will go with it by the release of the august housing numbers it should become clear that the housing market is beginning a significant decline when this realization hits home investors will finally have to confront the fact that they are gambling on people who took out no money down interest only adjustable rate mortgages at the top of the market and the financial institutions that made those loans the stock market should then begin a 25 30 decline if the market ignores the warning signs until fall the decline could occur in a single week

1852945 about the distorting power of rage the charge to acknowledge the inheritance of racism without being defined by it
1852946 the discovery of what it means to be an american
1852947 the time has come god knows for us to examine ourselves but we can only do this if we are willing to free ourselves of the myth of america and try to find out what is really happening here
1852948 o ur humanity is our burden our life we need not battle for it we need only to do what is infinitely more difficult that is accept it

1852957 virtually everybody was frankly slow in recognizing that we were on the cusp of a really draconian crisis
1852958 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
1852959 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1852960 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1852961 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1852962 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1852963 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1852974 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

1852989 i cant believe that lard nar didnt even mention me i helped save you too
1852990 i guess youre right you do deserve some recognition but it is your job to save people anyway
1852991 youre just like some kind of trouble magnet i suppose
1852992 if it wasnt for zim you probably would be long gone by now
1852993 i think hes so keen on protecting you now because well i guess he just always needs something to work for or hell go insane the tallest ordered him to get you well uh the information to them safely so hes pretty much just following orders
1852994 i can understand the first time when he pushed me out of the way of the metal claw he was probably just saving the information
1852995 dont worry about it zim can get really heroic sometimes and id hate to tell you this but he was probably just really really high on adrenaline the entire time
1852996 all of that sleep must have put your brain in overdrive
1852997 i guess ill see if theres a medical bay on this ship in a while
1852998 it was probably one of those meleshers i hear they love using knives

1853016 you think youre doing the right thing but youre not
1853017 i cant understand why youre giving it away people who wanted to buy the system thought it could make money if managed appropriately
1853018 certain patients including those at the end of life may be exceptionally prone to developing pressure ulcers despite receiving appropriate care
1853019 the rules could encourage unnecessary testing by hospitals eager to show that infections were already present at the time of admission and did not develop in the hospital
1853020 serious costly infections can occur even when doctors and nurses take all the recommended precautions
1853021 the philosophy at prime healthcare services the company that runs the hospital is to create the most efficient productive clear thinking environment possible we build the hospital around the emergency department its what drives everything here the highest benchmarks and standards are applied here in the emergency department to create efficiencies that are fast becoming the standard for other hospitals
1853022 here everything is analyzed to see how can we make things run optimally how long does it take for a patient to see a physician how much time is spent in the emergency how long to get an x ray blood count we want to exceed every national benchmark our average length of stay here in the er is less than two hours up in los angeles it can run six to nine hours
1853023 what if your mom was admitted here would you want her to sit around and have to wait thats what drives our environment the nurses here are extraordinarily professional theyre happy where they work and they have formed an incredible team with the doctors think of this as a small town hospital within the city the values the hands on care this is a special place
1853024 people will call from other emergency rooms where the wait is too long
1853025 the path they are going down right now doesnt sound like it will be productive for anyone
1853026 what it signals to me is that distrust and suspicion abound here
1853027 its too political its not a hometown union for our hometown hospital
1853028 the children of san diego are not and should never be a bargaining chip
1853029 one of the most despicable hijackings of a public process that ive ever witnessed
1853030 an event of international interest and one worthy to be commemorated by a united states coin issue is scheduled to take place in the near future the date has not yet been determined but it will be when the twentieth century vandals have been beaten to their knees and been compelled to accept the terms of the allies it should be issued in such quantities that it will never become rare and it should circulate at face value
1853031 patient has no realistic plans for self care patient is agitated delusional and threatened staff with physical harm
1853032 i learnt the first 5 notes on the e string

1853034 while they are deploying the anti missile systems in poland and the czech republic our long range strategic aircraft already will be landing in cuba
1853035 any deployment in cuba would be highly provocative and very costly there would be no military advantage cuba would want compensation
1853036 they the russians are trying to tell the guys in america that if they dont back out of their missile defence shield in europe we can make mischief in different places
1853037 we continue to work with the russians on this issue
1853038 we have consistently made it clear to them that our proposed deployment of a limited missile defence system in europe poses no threat to them or their nuclear deterrent
1853039 there is uncertainty over who is really in charge of russian foreign policy

1853044 with this kind of minimalist funding the canadian military will remain overstretched with only enough capacity to sustain 1 000 troops on the battlefield in a single location and no more
1853045 two per cent budgetary increases will become decreases in any year that the militarys inflation rate is above two per cent and it is safe to predict that this will happen every year into the foreseeable future
1853046 mr kenny in particular has too much time on his hands and is engaging in a sort of mid summer drive by smear in an attempt at self aggrandizement

1853053 because he was a cockroach archy was unable to operate the shift key on the typewriter he jumped on each key to type since using shift requires two keys to be pressed simultaneously he physically could not use capitals and so all of his verse was written without capitalization or punctuation writing in his own persona though marquis always used correct capitalization and punctuation
1853054 the teens through the mid 1930s were tumultuous times witnessing a world at war wrenching fights for labor rights and womens suffrage the excesses of the 20s and the crushing poverty of the depression marquis used his newspaper and magazine columns to comment on the events of the day good and bad exposing a progressive heart and an increasingly cynical soul archy the vers libre bard was an eloquent mouthpiece

1853090 were going to meet with our campaign people were going to pray about it and then regroup and decide where to go from there
1853091 with all these townships youre talking about 40 different precincts that report thats less than two votes per precinct
1853092 i realize in a race this close that people want to be absolutely sure the results are right i respect todds right to that
1853093 i also want to make sure that the person whos declared the republican candidate is truly the winner i have a lot of faith in our system our township clerks and county clerks at the same time i want to make sure its right
1853094 i spoke to todds representative this morning and told him ill show him the results of the canvass
1853095 your chances of picking up any votes in a recount are very slim
1853096 i did not see any township where there appeared to be any uncounted ballots i dont expect to see any glaring problems this was one of the smoothest elections weve had we had new equipment installed after the may elections
1853097 usually local races drive voter turnout for primaries and state and national races drive turnout for general elections
1853098 muy bien me dice su n mero de tel fono
1853099 aqu me viene que usted viv a en torrelodones hasta el 31 de diciembre de 1999 pero luego se mud a bagdad
1853100 pues nosotros funcionamos con la base de datos actualizada de la nasa
1853101 nosotros vimos y seguimos viendo anonadados c mo es posible que ciertos individuos que se llaman argentinos sigan siempre defendiendo lo for neo aun con mentiras y con intereses que ya no pueden ser ocultos a ning n argentino bien nacido

1853103 conocieron el mundo de la mentira de la riqueza de la vanidad y en vez de pelear ante ellos por nosotros por nuestra dura y amarga verdad se entregaron
1853104 son hombres que no tienen coraz n s lo quieren estar en el gobierno para pasarla bien

1853107 adakah kamu perhatikan lat dan uzza dan itu manat ketiga yang terakhir
1853108 kami tahu sudah bahwa allah itu menghidupkan dan mematikan menciptakan dan memberi rejeki tetapi dewa kami ini menjadi perantara kami kepadanya kalau ternyata dia juga kauberi tempat maka kamipun setuju dengan kau
1853109 kalau ternyata dewa dewa kami juga kauberi tempat maka kami pun setuju dengan kau
1853110 dan hampir hampir saja mereka itu menggoda kau tentang apa yang sudah kami wahyukan kepadamu supaya engkau mau atas nama kami memalsukannya dengan yang lain
1853111 ketika itulah mereka mengambil engkau menjadi kawan mereka dan kalaupun tidak kami tabahkan hatimu niscaya engkau hampir cenderung juga kepada mereka barang sedikit dalam hal ini akan kami timpakan kepadamu hukuman berlipat ganda dalam hidup dan mati selanjutnya engkau tiada akan mempunyai penolong menghadapi kami
1853112 dan tiada seorang rasul atau seorang nabi yang kami utus sebelum kau apabila ia bercita cita setan lalu memasukkan gangguan ke dalam cita citanya itu tetapi allah menghapuskan apa yang dimasukkan setan itu kemudian allah menguatkan keterangan keteranganya itu dan allah maha mengetahui dan bijaksana apa yang dimasukkan setan itu adalah ujian bagi mereka yang berpenyakit dalam hatinya dan berhati batu dan mereka yang melakukan kesalahan akan berada dalam pertentangan yang tak berkesudahan
1853113 dan tiada seorang rasul atau seorang nabi yang kami utus sebelum kau apabila ia bercita cita setan lalu memasukkan gangguan ke dalam cita citanya itu
1853114 dan kalaupun tidak kami tabahkan hatimu niscaya engkau hampir cenderung juga kepada mereka barang sedikit
1853115 dan tiada seorang rasul dan seorang nabi yang kami utus sebelum kau
1853116 dan sebenarnya mereka itulah gharaniq yang luhur dan perantaraan mereka bagi mereka yang diharapkan
1853117 sungguh dia telah melihat keterangan keterangan yang amat besar dan tuhan adakah kamu perhatikan lat dan uzza dan manat ketiga yang terakhir adakah untuk kamu itu yang laki laki dan untuk dia yang perempuan kalau begitu ini adalah pembagian yang tak seimbang ini hanyalah nama nama yang kamu buat sendiri kamu dan nenek moyang kamu allah tidak memberikan kekuasaan karenanya yang mereka turuti hanyalah prasangka dan kehendak nafsu belaka dan pada mereka pimpinan yang benar dari tuhan sudah pernah ada
1853118 adakah kamu perhatikan lat dan uzza dan manat ketiga yang terakhir itu gharaniq yang luhur perantaraannya dapat diharapkan adakah untuk kamu itu yang laki laki dan untuk dia yang perempuan kalau begitu ini adalah pembagian yang tak seimbang ini hanyalah nama nama yang kamu buat sendiri kamu dan nenek moyang kamu allah tidak memberikan kekuasaan karenanya
1853119 bagaimana pendapatmu sekalian kalau kukatakan bahwa pada permukaan bukit ini ada pasukan berkuda percayakah kamu
1853120 ya engkau tidak pernah disangsikan belum pernah kami melihat kau berdusta
1853121 serahkanlah putusan kamu ini di tangan orang yang pertama sekali memasuki pintu shafa ini
1853122 ketahuilah bahwa masyarakatmu ini tidak punya tujuan mereka dalam kesesatan apa artinya kita mengelilingi batu itu memdengar tidak melihat tidak merugikan tidak menguntungkanpun juga tidak hanya darah korban yang mengalir di atas batu itu saudara saudara marilah kita mencari agama lain bukan ini
1853123 ya allah kalau aku mengetahui dengan cara bagaimana yang lebih kausukai aku menyembahmu tentu akan kulakukan tetapi aku tidak me ngetahuinya
1853124 barangsiapa mengerjakan kebaikan seberat atompun akan dilihatnya dan barangsiapa mengerjakan kejahatan seberat atompun akan dilihatnya pula
1853125 o putera pamanku 9 bergembiralah dan tabahkan hatimu demi dia yang memegang hidup khadijah 10 aku berharap kiranya engkau akan menjadi nabi atas umat ini samasekali allah takkan mencemoohkan kau sebab engkaulah yang mempererat tali kekeluargaan jujur dalam kata kata kau yang mau memikul beban orang lain dan menghormati tamu dan menolong mereka yang dalam kesulitan atas jalan yang benar
1853126 yang mula mula didatangkan kepada para nabi itu mereka dalam keadaan tidur dengan maksud supaya hati mereka tenteram
1853127 ini yang dikatakan alqama ibn qais sendiri suatu keterangan yang baik diperkuat oleh yang datang sebelum dan sesudahnya
1853128 kami sungguh mengetahui bahwa mereka berkata yang mengajarkan itu adalah seorang manusia bahasa orang yang mereka tuduhkan itu bahasa asing sedang ini adalah bahasa arab yang jelas sekali
1853129 aku dapat mengenal mana yang baik dan mana pula yang buruk apa salahnya kalau aku mendengarkan sendiri apa yang akan dikatakan orang itu jika ternyata baik akan kuterima kalau buruk akan kutinggalkan
1853130 kamu utusan yang gagal kamu sekalian disuruh oleh masyarakat seagamamu mencari berita tentang orang itu sebelum kamu kenal benar benar siapa dia agama kamu sudah kamu tinggalkan dan lalu percaya saja apa yang dikatakannya
1853131 bermasam dan membuang muka ia tatkala si buta mendatanginya dan apa yang memberitahukan kau barangkali ia orang yang bersih atau ia dapat menerima teguran dan teguran itu berguna baginya tetapi kepada orang yang serba cukup itu engkau menghadapkan diri padahal itu bukan urusanmu kalau dia tidak bersih hati tetapi orang yang bersungguh sungguh datang kepadamu dengan rasa penuh takut kau abaikan dia tidak itu adalah sebuah peringatan barangsiapa yang sudi biarlah memperhatikan peringatan itu dalam kitab kitab yang dimuliakan dijunjung tinggi dan disucikan yang ditulis dengan tangan orang orang terhormat orang orang yang bersih
1853132 yang paling mulia di antara kamu dalam pandangan allah ialah yang paling dapat menjaga diri yang paling takwa
1853133 wahyu didatangkan kepada muhammad bukan kepadaku padahal aku kepala dan pemimpin quraisy juga tidak kepada abu masud amr b umair ath thaqafi sebagai pemimpin thaqif kami adalah pembesar pembesar dua kota
1853134 dan mereka berkata kenapa quran ini tidak diturunkan kepada orang besar dari dua kota itu adakah mereka membagi bagikan kurnia tuhanmu kamilah yang membagikan penghidupan mereka itu dalam hidup dunia ini
1853135 kami sudah saling memperebutkan kehormatan itu dengan keluarga abd manaf
1853136 di kalangan kami ada seorang nabi yang menerima wahyu dari langit
1853137 apabila datang suara dahsyat yang memekakkan tatkala seseorang lari meninggalkan saudaranya ibunya dan bapanya isterinya dan anak anaknya setiap orang hari itu dengan urusannya sendiri wajah wajah pada hari itu ada yang berseri tertawa dan bergembira dan ada pula wajah wajah kelabu pada hari itu tertutup kegelapan mereka itulah orang orang yang ingkar orang orang yang sudah rusak
1853138 apabila langit sudah bagaikan hancuran logam dan gunung gunung bagaikan gumpalan bulu dan tak akan ada kawan akrab menanyakan kawannya padahal mereka menampakkan diri kepada mereka ingin sekali orang jahat itu akan dapat menebus diri dari siksaan hari itu dengan memberikan anak anaknya isterinya saudaranya dan keluarganya yang melindunginya dan semua yang ada di bumi kemudian ia hendak menyelamatkan diri tidak sekali kali itu adalah api menyala lapisan kepalapun tercabut dipanggilnya orang yang telah pergi membelakangi dan yang berpaling yang telah menyimpan kekayaan dan menyembunyikannya
1853139 setiap kulit kulit mereka itu sudah matang kami ganti dengan kulit lain lagi supaya siksaan itu mereka rasakan
1853140 mungkin saja mereka dalam gua itu tapi saya tidak melihat ada orang yang menuju ke sana
1853141 ada sarang laba laba di tempat itu yang memang sudah ada sejak sebelum muhammad lahir
1853142 saya melihat ada dua ekor burung dara hutan di lubang gua itu jadi saya mengetahui tak ada orang di sana
1853143 kalau mereka ada yang menengok ke bawah pasti akan melihat kita
1853144 abu bakr kalau kau menduga bahwa kita hanya berdua ketiganya adalah tuhan
1853145 tiga peristiwa itu sajalah mujizat yang diceritakan oleh sejarah islam yang benar benar sarang laba laba hinggapnya burung dara dan tumbuhnya pohon pohonan dan ketiga keajaiban ini setiap hari persamaannya selalu ada di muka bumi
1853146 mereka berdua menuju ke sebuah gua di gunung thaur sebuah gunung di bawah mekah lalu masuk ke dalamnya abu bakr meminta anaknya abdullah supaya mendengar dengarkan apa yang dikatakan orang tentang mereka itu siang hari lalu sorenya supaya kembali membawakan berita yang terjadi hari itu sedang amir b fuhaira supaya menggembalakan kambingnya siang hari dan diistirahatkan kembali bila sorenya ia kembali ke dalam gua ketika itu bila hari sudah sore asma datang membawakan makanan yang cocok buat mereka rasulullah s a w tinggal dalam gua selama tiga hari tiga malam ketika ia menghilang quraisy menyediakan seratus ekor unta bagi barangsiapa yang dapat mengembalikannya kepada mereka sedang abdullah b abi bakr siangnya berada di tengah tengah quraisy mendengarkan permufakatan mereka dan apa yang mereka percakapkan tentang rasulullah s aw dan abu bakr sorenya ia kembali dan menyampaikan berita itu kepada mereka amir b fuhaira pembantu abu bakr waktu itu menggembalakan ternaknya di tengah tengah para gembala mekah sorenya kambing abu bakr itu diistirahatkan lalu mereka memerah susu dan menyiapkan daging kalau paginya abdullah b abi bakr bertolak dari tempat itu ke mekah amir b fuhaira mengikuti jejaknya dengan membawa kambing supaya jejak itu terhapus sesudah berlalu tiga hari dan orangpun mulai tenang aman mereka orang yang disewa datang membawa unta kedua orang itu serta untanya sendiri dan seterusnya
1853147 ingatlah tatkala orang orang kafir quraisy itu berkomplot membuat rencana terhadap kau hendak menangkap kau atau membunuh kau atau mengusir kau mereka membuat rencana dan allah membuat rencana pula allah adalah perencana terbaik
1853148 kalau kamu tak dapat menolongnya maka allah juga yang telah menolongnya tatkala dia diusir oleh orang orang kafir quraisy dia salah seorang dari dua orang itu ketika keduanya berada dalam gua waktu itu ia berkata kepada temannya itu jangan bersedih hati tuhan bersama kita maka tuhan lalu memberikan ketenangan kepadanya dan dikuatkannya dengan pasukan yang tidak kamu lihat dan allah menjadikan seruan orang orang kafir itu juga yang rendah dan kalam allah itulah yang tinggi dan allah maha kuasa dan bijaksana
1853149 saya suraqa bin jusyum tunggulah saya mau bicara demi allah tuan tuan jangan menyangsikan saya saya tidak akan melakukan sesuatu yang akan merugikan tuan tuan
1853150 yang datang ke daerah kita ini dengan maksud supaya orang orang yang hina dina di kalangan kita dapat merendahkan keluarga kita tegur mereka itu dan cegah sebenarnya said b zurara itu masih sepupuku dari pihak ibu jadi saya tidak dapat mendatanginya
1853151 kalau hal ini kau setujui dapatlah kauterima tapi kalau tidak kausukai maukah kau lepas tangan
1853152 hai banu apa yang kamu ketahui tentang diriku di tengah tengah kamu sekalian
1853153 pemimpin kami yang paling dekat kepada kami dengan pandangan dan pengalaman yang terpuji
1853154 maka kata katamu baik wanita maupun pria bagiku adalah suci selama kamu beriman kepada allah dan rasulnya
1853155 kalau kau memang berguna bertahanlah dan ini pedang bersama kau
1853156 sehingga permusuhan antara engkau dengan dia itu sudah seperti persahabatan yang erat sekali
1853157 barangkali yang ada padamu itu sama dengan yang ada padaku
1853158 tapi yang ada padaku lebih utama tentunya yaitu quran sebagai bimbingan dan cahaya
1853159 kawan kawan ini adalah lebih baik daripada apa yang ada pada kita semua
1853160 sungguh luar biasa tidak akan tinggal diam sebelum aku mati terbunuh wahai masyarakat aus kalau kamu mau menyerahkan aku lakukanlah
1853161 sekarang akan ada seorang nabi utusan tuhan yang sudah dekat waktunya kami akan jadi pengikutnya dan kami dengan dia akan memerangi kamu seperti dalam perang ad dan iram
1853162 sungguh inilah nabi yang pernah dijanjikan orang orang yahudi kepada kita
1853163 kami telah meninggalkan golongan kami yakni aus dan khazraj dan tidak ada lagi golongan yang saling bermusuhan dan saling mengancam mudah mudahan tuhan mempersatukan mereka dengan tuan bila mereka itu sudah dapat dipertemukan dengan tuan maka tak adalah orang yang lebih mulia dari tuan
1853164 posisi muhammad di tengah tengah kami sudah sama sama tuan tuan ketahui kami dan mereka yang sepaham dengan kami telah melindunginya dari gangguan masyarakat kami sendiri dia adalah orang yang terhormat di kalangan masyarakatnya dan mempunyai kekuatan di negerinya sendiri tetapi dia ingin bergabung dengan tuan tuan juga jadi kalau memang tuan tuan merasa dapat menepati janji seperti yang tuan tuan berikan kepadanya itu dan dapat melindunginya dari mereka yang menentangnya maka silakanlah tuan tuan laksanakan akan tetapi kalau tuan tuan akan menyerahkan dia dan membiarkannya terlantar sesudah berada di tempat tuan tuan maka dari sekarang lebih baik tinggalkan sajalah
1853165 sudah kami dengar apa yang tuan katakan sekarang silakan rasulullah bicara kemukakanlah apa yang tuan senangi dan disenangi tuhan
1853166 saya minta ikrar tuan tuan akan membela saya seperti membela isteri isteri dan anak anak tuan tuan sendiri
1853167 rasulullah kami sudah berikrar kami adalah orang peperangan dan ahli bertempur yang sudah kami warisi dari leluhur kami
1853168 rasulullah kami dengan orang orang itu yakni orang orang yahudi terikat oleh perjanjian yang sudah akan kami putuskan tetapi apa jadinya kalau kami lakukan ini lalu kelak tuhan memberikan kemenangan kepada tuan tuan akan kembali kepada masyarakat tuan dan meninggalkan kami
1853169 tidak saya sehidup semati dengan tuan tuan tuan tuan adalah saya dan saya adalah tuan tuan saya akan memerangi siapa saja yang tuan tuan perangi dan saya akan berdamai dengan siapa saja yang tuan tuan ajak berdamai
1853170 saudara saudara dari khazraj untuk apakah kalian memberikan ikrar kepada orang ini kamu menyatakan ikrar dengan dia tidak melakukan perang terhadap yang hitam dan yang merah4 melawan orang orang itu5 kalau tuan tuan merasa bahwa jika harta benda tuan tuan habis binasa dan pemuka pemuka tuan tuan mati terbunuh tuan tuan akan menyerahkan dia kepada musuh maka lebih baik dari sekarang tinggalkan saja dia kalaupun itu juga yang tuan tuan lakukan ini adalah suatu perbuatan hina dunia akhirat sebaliknya bila tuan tuan memang dapat menepati janji seperti yang tuan tuan berikan kepadanya itu sekalipun harta benda tuan tuan akan habis dan bangsawan bangsawan akan mati terbunuh maka silakan saja tuan tuan terima dia itulah suatu perbuatan yang baik dunia akhirat
1853171 akan kami terima sekalipun harta benda kami habis bangsawan bangsawan kami terbunuh tetapi rasulullah kalau dapat kami tepati semua ini apa yang akan kami peroleh
1853172 pilihkan dua belas orang pemimpin dari kalangan tuan tuan yang akan menjadi penanggung jawab masyarakatnya
1853173 tuan tuan adalah penanggung jawab masyarakat tuan tuan seperti pertanggung jawaban pengikut pengikut isa bin mariam terhadap masyarakat saya sayalah yang bertanggungjawab
1853174 kami berikrar mendengar dan setia di waktu suka dan duka di waktu bahagia dan sengsara kami hanya akan berkata yang benar di mana saja kami berada dan kami tidak takut kritik siapapun atas jalan allah ini
1853175 muhammad dan orang orang yang pindah kepercayaan itu sudah berkumpul akan memerangi kamu
1853176 demi allah yang telah mengutus tuan atas dasar kebenaran kalau sekiranya tuan sudi penduduk mina itu besok akan kami habiskan dengan pedang kami
1853177 kami tidak diperintahkan untuk itu kembalilah ke kemah tuan tuan
1853178 masukkan dia dalam kurungan besi dan tutup pintunya rapat rapat kemudian awasi biar dia mengalami nasib seperti penyair penyair semacamnya sebelum dia seperti zuhair dan nabigha
1853179 kita keluarkan dia dari lingkungan kita kita buang dari negeri kita sesudah itu tidak perlu kita pedulikan lagi urusannya
1853180 kuinginkan dia akan menjadi orang yang terpuji1 bagi tuhan di langit dan bagi makhluknya di bumi
1853181 tidak senang aku pulang bersama dengan teman temanku tanpa membawa seorang bayi biarlah aku pergi kepada anak yatim itu dan akan kubawa juga
1853182 mudah mudahan karena itu tuhan akan memberi berkah kepada kita
1853183 saudaraku yang dari quraisy itu telah diambil oleh dua orang laki laki berbaju putih dia dibaringkan perutnya dibedah sambil di balik balikan
1853184 aku didatangi oleh dua orang laki laki berpakaian putih aku di baringkan lalu perutku di bedah mereka mencari sesuatu di dalamnya tak tahu aku apa yang mereka cari
1853185 biarlah kami bawa anak ini kepada raja kami di negeri kami anak ini akan menjadi orang penting kamilah yang mengetahui keadaannya
1853186 bukankah sudah kami lapangkan dadamu dan sudah kami lepaskan beban dari kau yang telah memberati punggungmu
1853187 aku yang paling fasih di antara kamu sekalian aku dari quraisy tapi diasuh di tengah tengah keluarga sad bin bakr
1853188 bukankah engkau dalam keadaan yatim piatu lalu diadakannya orang yang akan melindungimu dan menemukan kau kehilangan pedoman lalu ditunjukkannya jalan itu
1853189 aku mengikutinya bersama dengan paman pamanku juga ikut melemparkan panah dalam perang itu sebab aku tidak suka kalau tidak juga aku ikut melaksanakan
1853190 aku tidak suka mengganti fakta yang kuhadiri di rumah ibn judan itu dengan jenis unta yang baik kalau sekarang aku diajak pasti kukabulkan
1853191 musa diutus dia gembala kambing daud diutus dia gembala kambing aku diutus juga gembala kambing keluargaku di ajyad
1853192 kami adalah golongan yang hanya makan bila merasa lapar dan bila sudah makan tidak sampai kenyang
1853193 aku bukan orang berpunya keadaan makin menekan kita juga aku mendengar bahwa khadijah mengupah orang dengan dua ekor anak unta tapi aku tidak setuju kalau akan mendapat upah semacam itu juga setujukah kau kalau hal ini kubicarakan dengan dia
1853194 aku mendengar engkau mengupah orang dengan dua ekor anak unta tapi buat muhammad aku tidak setuju kurang dari empat ekor
1853195 kalau permintaanmu itu buat orang yang jauh dan tidak kusukai akan kukabulkan apalagi buat orang yang dekat dan kusukai
1853196 muhammad cepat cepatlah kau menemui khadijah dan ceritakan pengalamanmu dia akan mengerti hal itu
1853197 kalau itu disediakan dan yang melamarmu itu cantik berharta terhormat dan memenuhi syarat tidakkah akan kauterima
1853198 engkaukah yang melakukan itu terhadap dewa dewa kami hai ibrahim
1853199 tidak itu dilakukan oleh yang paling besar diantara mereka tanyakanlah kepada mereka kalau memang mereka bisa bicara
1853200 bila malam sudah gelap dilihatnya sebuah bintang ia berkata inilah tuhanku tetapi bilamana bintang itu kemudian terbenam iapun berkata aku tidak menyukai segala yang terbenam dan setelah dilihatnya bulan terbit iapun berkata inilah tuhanku tetapi bilamana bulan itu kemudian terbenam iapun berkata kalau tuhan tidak memberi petunjuk kepadaku pastilah aku akan jadi sesat dan setelah dilihatnya matahari terbit iapun berkata ini tuhanku ini yang lebih besar tetapi bilamana matahari itu juga kemudian terbenam iapun berkata oh kaumku aku lepas tangan terhadap apa yang kamu persekutukan itu aku mengarahkan wajahku hanya kepada yang telah menciptakan semesta langit dan bumi ini aku tidak termasuk mereka yang mempersekutukan tuhan
1853201 bila ia sudah mencapai usia cukup untuk berusaha ia ibrahim berkata o anakku dalam tidur aku bermimpi bahwa aku menyembelihmu lihatlah bagaimanakah pendapatmu ia menjawab wahai ayahku lakukanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepadamu jika dikehendaki tuhan akan kaudapati aku dalam kesabaran setelah keduanya menyerahkan diri dan dibaringkannya ke sebelah keningnya ia kami panggil hai ibrahim engkau telah melaksanakan mimpi itu dengan begitu kami memberikan balasan kepada mereka yang berbuat kebaikan ini adalah suatu ujian yang nyata dan kami menebusnya dengan sebuah kurban besar
1853202 bahwa rumah pertama dibuat untuk manusia beribadat ialah yang di mekah itu sudah diberi berkah dan bimbingan bagi semesta alam disitulah terdapat keterangan keterangan yang jelas sebagai maqam tempat ibrahim barangsiapa memasukinya menjadi aman
1853203 dan ingatlah kami jadikan rumah itu tempat berkumpul bagi manusia dan tempat yang aman dan jadikanlah maqam ibrahim itu tempat bersembahyang dan kami serahkan kepada ibrahim dan ismail menyucikan rumahku bagi mereka yang bertawaf mereka yang tinggal menetap dan mereka yang ruku dan sujud dan ingatlah tatkala ibrahim berkata tuhanku jadikan tempat ini kota yang aman dan berikanlah buah buahan kepada penduduknya mereka yang beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian ia berkata dan bagi barang siapa yang menolak iman akan kuberi juga kesenangan sementara kemudian kutarik ia ke dalam siksa api tujuan yang paling celaka dan ingatlah tatkala ibrahim dan ismail mengangkat sendi sendi rumah suci itu mereka berdoa tuhan terimalah ini dari kami sesungguhnyalah engkau maha mendengar maha mengetahui
1853204 o hud kau datang tidak membawa keterangan yang jelas dan kami tidak akan meninggalkan tuhan tuhan kami hanya karena perkataanmu itu kami tidak percaya kepadamu
1853205 dan kami tidak akan mengadakan siksaan sebelum kami mengutus seorang rasul
1853206 engkau anak kilab bin murra dan keluargamu di mekah menempati rumah suci
1853207 saudara saudara quraisy kamu sekalian adalah tetangga tuhan keluarga rumahnya dan tempat yang suci mereka yang datang berziarah adalah tamu tuhan dan pengunjung rumahnya mereka itulah para tamu yang paling patut dihormati pada musim ziarah itu sediakanlah makanan dan minuman sampai mereka pulang kembali
1853208 tidak tetapi marilah kita mengadakan pembagian antara aku dengan kamu sekalian kita mengadu nasib dengan permainan qid h anak panah dua anak panah buat kabah dua buat aku dan dua buat kamu kalau anak panah itu keluar ia mendapat bagian kalau tidak dia tidak mendapat apa apa
1853209 sediakanlah tebusan sepuluh ekor unta kemudian keduanya itu diundi dengan anak panah kalau yang keluar itu atas nama anak kamu ditambahlah jumlah unta itu sampai dewa berkenan
1853210 tidakkah kau perhatikan bagaimana tuhanmu berbuat terhadap pasukan orang orang bergajah bukankah dia gagalkan rencana mereka dan dilepaskan di atas mereka pasukan pasukan burung melempari mereka dengan batu yang keras membakar sehingga mereka seperti daun daun kering yang binasa berserakan
1853211 maha kudus ia maha kudus demi dia yang memegang hidup waraqa khadijah percayalah dia telah menerima namus besar1 seperti yang pernah diterima musa dan sungguh dia adalah nabi umat ini katakan kepadanya supaya tetap tabah
1853212 o orang yang berselimut bangunlah dan sampaikan peringatan dan agungkan tuhanmu pakaianmupun bersihkan dan hindarkan perbuatan dosa jangan kau memberi karena ingin menerima lebih banyak dan demi tuhanmu tabahkan hatimu
1853213 jibril membawa perintah supaya aku memberi peringatan kepada umat manusia mengajak mereka dan supaya mereka beribadat hanya kepada allah tapi siapa yang akan kuajak dan siapa pula yang akan mendengarkan
1853214 demi dia yang memegang hidup waraqa engkau adalah nabi atas umat ini engkau telah menerima namus besar seperti yang pemah disampaikan kepada musa pastilah kau akan didustakan orang akan disiksa akan diusir dan akan diperangi kalau sampai pada waktu itu aku masih hidup pasti aku akan membela yang di pihak allah dengan pembelaan yang sudah diketahuinya pula
1853215 sungguh hari kemudian itu lebih baik buat kau daripada yang sekarang
1853216 abu talib saudaramu anaknya banyak seperti kaulihat banyak orang yang mengalami krisis baiklah kita ringankan dia dari anak anaknya itu aku akan mengambilnya seorang kaupun seorang untuk kemudian kita asuh
1853217 yang mengutusku menjadi nabi dan memerintahkan aku mengajak manusia menyembah allah
1853218 tuhan menjadikan saya tanpa saya perlu berunding dengan abu talib apa gunanya saya harus berunding dengan dia untuk menyembah allah
1853219 menjadi kesayangan masyarakatnya dan amikal sekali dari kalangan quraisy ia termasuk orang quraisy yang berketurunan tinggi dan yang banyak mengetahui segala seluk beluk bangsa itu yang baik dan yang jahat sebagai pedagang dan orang yang berakhlak baik ia cukup terkenal kalangan masyarakatnya sendiri yang terkemuka mengenalnya dalam satu bidang saja mereka mengenalnya karena ilmunya karena perdagangannya dan karena pergaulannya yang baik
1853220 sampaikanlah apa yang sudah diperintahkan kepadamu dan tidak usah kauhiraukan orang orang musyrik itu
1853221 saya tidak melihat ada seorang manusia di kalangan arab ini dapat membawakan sesuatu ke tengah tengah mereka lebih baik dari yang saya bawakan kepada kamu sekalian ini kubawakan kepada kamu dunia dan akhirat yang terbaik tuhan telah menyuruh aku mengajak kamu sekalian siapa di antara kamu ini yang mau mendukungku dalam hal ini
1853222 bagaimana pendapatmu sekalian kalau kuberitahukan kamu bahwa pada permukaan bukit ini ada pasukan berkuda percayakah kamu
1853223 engkau tidak pernah disangsikan belum pernah kami melihat engkau berdusta
1853224 aku mengingatkan kamu sekalian sebelum menghadapi siksa yang sungguh berat
1853225 banu banu abd manaf banu zuhra banu taim banu makhzum dan banu asad allah memerintahkan aku memberi peringatan kepada keluarga keluargaku terdekat baik untuk kehidupan dunia atau akhirat tak ada sesuatu bahagian atau keuntungan yang dapat kuberikan kepada kamu selain kamu ucapkan tak ada tuhan selain allah
1853226 celakalah kedua tangan abu lahab dan celakalah ia tak ada gunanya kekayaan dan usahanya itu api yang menjilat jilat akan menggulungnya
1853227 kamu telah dilalaikan oleh perlombaan saling memperbanyak sampai nanti kamu menuju kubur sekali lagi jangan akan kamu ketahui juga nanti jangan kalau kamu mengetahui dengan meyakinkan niscaya akan kamu lihat neraka kemudian tentu akan kamu lihat itu dengan mata yang meyakinkan hari itu kemudian baru kamu akan ditanyai tentang kesenangan itu
1853228 katakanlah aku tak berkuasa membawa kebaikan atau menolak bahaya untuk diriku sendiri kalau tidak dengan kehendak allah dan sekiranya aku mengetahui yang gaib gaib niscaya kuperbanyak amal kebaikan itu dan bahayapun tidak menyentuhku tapi aku hanya memberi peringatan dan membawa berita gembira bagi mereka yang beriman
1853229 kemenakanmu itu sudah memaki berhala berhala kita mencela agama kita tidak menghargai harapan harapan kita dan menganggap sesat nenek moyang kita soalnya sekarang harus kauhentikan dia kalau tidak biarlah kami sendiri yang akan menghadapinya oleh karena engkau juga seperti kami tidak sejalan maka cukuplah engkau dari pihak kami menghadapi dia
1853230 engkau sebagai orang yang terhormat terpandang di kalangan kami kami telah minta supaya menghentikan kemenakanmu itu tapi tidak juga kaulakukan kami tidak akan tinggal diam terhadap orang yang memaki nenek moyang kita tidak menghargai harapan harapan kita dan mencela berhala berhala kita sebelum kausuruh dia diam atau sama sama kita lawan dia hingga salah satu pihak nanti binasa
1853231 jagalah aku begitu juga dirimu jangan aku dibebani hal hal yang tak dapat kupikul
1853232 paman demi allah kalaupun mereka meletakkan matahari di tangan kananku dan meletakkan bulan di tangan kiriku dengan maksud supaya aku meninggalkan tugas ini sungguh tidak akan kutinggalkan biar nanti allah yang akan membuktikan kemenangan itu di tanganku atau aku binasa karenanya
1853233 anakku katakanlah sekehendakmu aku tidak akan menyerahkan engkau bagaimanapun juga
1853234 demi allah kalaupun mereka meletakkan matahari di tangan kananku dan meletakkan bulan di tangan kiriku dengan maksud supaya aku meninggalkan tugas ini sungguh tidak akan kutinggalkan biar nanti allah yang akan membuktikan kemenangan itu di tanganku atau aku binasa karenanya
1853235 barangsiapa berbuat kebaikan seberat atompun akan dilihatnya dan barangsiapa berbuat kejahatan seberat atompun akan dilihatnya pula
1853236 seperti kau ketahui dari segi keturunan engkau mempunyai tempat di kalangan kami engkau telah membawa soal besar ke tengah tengah masyarakatmu sehingga mereka cerai berai karenanya sekarang dengarkanlah kami akan menawarkan beberapa masalah kalau kalau sebagian dapat kauterima kalau dalam hal ini yang kauinginkan adalah harta kamipun siap mengumpulkan harta kami sehingga hartamu akan menjadi yang terbanyak di antara kami kalau kau menghendaki pangkat kami angkat engkau di atas kami semua kami takkan memutuskan suatu perkara tanpa ada persetujuanmu kalau kedudukan raja yang kauinginkan kami nobatkan kau sebagai raja kami jika engkau dihinggapi penyakit saraf4 yang tak dapat kautolak sendiri akan kami usahakan pengobatannya dengan harta benda kami sampai kau sembuh
1853237 tempat itu diperintah seorang raja dan tak ada orang yang dianiaya disitu itu bumi jujur sampai nanti allah membukakan jalan buat kita semua
1853238 mereka datang ke negeri paduka ini adalah budak budak kami yang tidak punya malu mereka meninggalkan agama bangsanya dan tidak pula menganut agama paduka mereka membawa agama yang mereka ciptakan sendiri yang tidak kami kenal dan tidak juga paduka kami diutus kepada paduka oleh pemimpin pemimpin masyarakat mereka oleh orang orang tua paman mereka dan keluarga mereka sendiri supaya paduka sudi mengembalikan orang orang itu kepada mereka mereka lebih mengetahui betapa orang orang itu mencemarkan dan memaki maki
1853239 agama apa ini yang sampai membuat tuan tuan meninggalkan masyarakat tuan tuan sendiri tetapi tidak juga tuan tuan menganut agamaku atau agama lain
1853240 ketika itu kami masyarakat yang bodoh kami menyembah berhala bangkaipun kami makan segala kejahatan kami lakukan memutuskan hubungan dengan kerabat dengan tetanggapun kami tidak baik yang kuat menindas yang lemah demikian keadaan kami sampai tuhan mengutus seorang rasul dari kalangan kami yang sudah kami kenal asal usulnya dia jujur dapat dipercaya dan bersih pula ia mengajak kami menyembah hanya kepada allah yang maha esa dan meninggalkan batu batu dan patung patung yang selama itu kami dan nenek moyang kami menyembahnya ia menganjurkan kami untuk tidak berdusta untuk berlaku jujur serta mengadakan hubungan keluarga dan tetangga yang baik serta menyudahi pertumpahan darah dan perbuatan terlarang lainnya ia melarang kami melakukan segala kejahatan dan menggunakan kata kata dusta memakan harta anak piatu atau mencemarkan wanita wanita yang bersih ia minta kami menyembah allah dan tidak mempersekutukannya selanjutnya disuruhnya kami melakukan salat zakat dan puasa lalu disebutnya beberapa ketentuan islam kami pun membenarkannya kami turut segala yang diperintahkan allah lalu yang kami sembah hanya allah yang tunggal tidak mempersekutukan nya dengan apa dan siapa pun juga segala yang diharamkan kami jauhi dan yang dihalalkan kami lakukan karena itulah masyarakat kami memusuhi kami menyiksa kami dan menghasut supaya kami meninggalkan agama kami dan kembali menyembah berhala supaya kami membenarkan segala keburukan yang pernah kami lakukan dulu oleh karena mereka memaksa kami menganiaya dan menekan kami mereka menghalang halangi kami dari agama kami maka kamipun keluar pergi ke negeri tuan ini tuan jugalah yang menjadi pilihan kami senang sekali kami berada di dekat tuan dengan harapan di sini takkan ada penganiayaan
1853241 adakah ajaran tuhan yang dibawanya itu yang dapat tuan tuan bacakan kepada kami
1853242 kata kata yang keluar dari sumber yang mengeluarkan kata kata yesus kristus
1853243 kata kata ini dan yang dibawa oleh musa keluar dari sumber cahaya yang sama tuan tuan kepada kedua orang utusan quraisy pergilah kami takkan menyerahkan mereka kepada tuan tuan
1853244 tentang dia pendapat kami seperti yang dikatakan nabi kami dia adalah hamba allah dan utusannya ruhnya dan firmannya yang disampaikan kepada perawan mariam
1853245 antara agama tuan tuan dan agama kami sebenarnya tidak lebih dari garis ini
1853246 dan balasan yang kamu terima hanya menurut apa yang kamu perbuat
1853247 demi allah kalaupun mereka meletakkan matahari di tangan kananku dan meletakkan bulan di tangan kiriku dengan maksud supaya aku meninggalkan tugas ini sungguh tidak akan kutinggalkan biar nanti allah yang akan membuktikan kemenangan itu di tanganku atau aku binasa karenanya
1853248 umar engkau menipu diri sendiri kaukira keluarga abd manaf akan membiarkan kau merajalela begini sesudah engkau membunuh muhammad tidak lebih baik kau pulang saja ke rumah dan perbaiki keluargamu sendiri
1853249 aku sudah mengetahui kamu menjadi pengikut muhammad dan menganut agamanya
1853250 kau sudi menikmati makanan pakaian dan wanita wanita padahal seperti kau ketahui keluarga ibumu demikian rupa tidak boleh berhubungan dengan orang berjual beli tidak boleh saling mengawinkan aku bersumpah bahwa kalau mereka itu keluargaku dari pihak ibu keluarga ibn hisyam lalu aku diajak seperti mengajak kau tentu akan kutolak
1853251 hai penduduk mekah kamu sekalian enak enak makan dan berpakaian padahal banu hasyim binasa tidak dapat mengadakan hubungan dagang demi allah saya tidak akan duduk sebelum piagam yang kejam ini dirobek
1853252 tidak apa kalau saya lakukan itu allah mengetahui bahwa saya tetap taat
1853253 dan hampir hampir saja mereka itu menggoda kau tentang yang sudah kami wahyukan kepadamu supaya engkau mau atas nama kami memalsukan dengan yang lain ketika itulah mereka mengambil engkau menjadi kawan mereka dan kalaupun tidak kami tabahkan hatimu niscaya engkau hampir cenderung juga kepada mereka barang sedikit dalam hal ini akan kami timpakan kepadamu hukuman berlipat ganda dalam hidup dan mati selanjutnya engkau tiada mempunyai penolong menghadapi kami
1853254 abu talib seperti kau ketahui kau adalah dari keluarga kami juga keadaan sekarang seperti kau ketahui sendiri sangat mencemaskan kami engkau juga sudah mengetahui keadaan kami dengan kemenakanmu itu panggillah dia kami akan saling memberi dan saling menerima dia angkat tangan dari kami kamipun akan demikian biarlah kami dengan agama kami dan dia dengan agamanya sendiri pula
1853255 sepatah kata saja saya minta yang akan membuat mereka merajai semua orang arab dan bukan arab
1853256 katakan tak ada tuhan selain allah dan tinggalkan segala penyembahan yang selain allah
1853257 muhammad maksudmu supaya tuhan tuhan itu dijadikan satu tuhan saja
1853258 orang ini tidak akan memberikan apa apa seperti yang kamu kehendaki pergilah kalian
1853259 sebelum wafat abu talib orang orang quraisy itu tidak seberapa mengganggu saya
1853260 allahumma yang allah kepadamu juga aku mengadukan kelemahanku kurangnya kemampuanku serta kehinaan diriku di hadapan manusia o tuhan maha pengasih maha penyayang engkaulah yang melindungi si lemah dan engkaulah pelindungku kepada siapa hendak kauserahkan daku kepada orang yang jauhkah yang berwajah muram kepadaku atau kepada musuh yang akan menguasai diriku asalkan engkau tidak murka kepadaku aku tidak peduli sebab sungguh luas kenikmatan yang kaulimpahkan kepadaku aku berlindung kepada nur wajah mu yang menyinari kegelapan dan karenanya membawakan kebaikan bagi dunia dan akhirat daripada kemurkaanmu yang akan kautimpakan kepadaku engkaulah yang berhak menegur hingga berkenan pada mu dan tiada daya upaya selain dengan engkau juga3
1853261 kata kata ini tak pernah diucapkan oleh penduduk negeri ini
1853262 addas jangan sampai orang itu memalingkan kau dari agamamu yang masih lebih baik daripada agamanya
1853263 malam itu rasulullah bermalam di rumah saya selesai salat akhir malam ia tidur dan kamipun tidur pada waktu sebelum fajar rasulullah sudah membangunkan kami sesudah melakukan ibadat pagi bersama sama kami ia berkata umm hani saya sudah salat akhir malam bersama kamu sekalian seperti yang kaulihat di lembah ini kemudian saya ke yerusalem dan bersembahyang di sana sekarang saya sembahyang siang bersama sama kamu seperti kaulihat
1853264 rasulullah janganlah menceritakan ini kepada orang lain orang akan mendustakan dan mengganggumu lagi
1853265 jasad rasulullah s a w tidak hilang tetapi allah menjadikan isra8 itu dengan ruhnya
1853266 tidak lain mimpi yang kami perlihatkan kepadamu adalah sebagai ujian bagi manusia
1853267 pada tengah malam yang sunyi dan hening burung burung malampun diam membisu binatang binatang buas sudah berdiam diri gemercik air dan siulan angin juga sudah tak terdengar lagi ketika itu muhammad terbangun oleh suara yang memanggilnya
1853268 maka meluncurlah buraq itu seperti anak panah membubung di atas pegunungan mekah di atas pasir pasir sahara menuju arah ke utara
1853269 sementara itu ada suara suara misterius mencoba menghentikan nabi orang yang begitu ikhlas menjalankan risalahnya ia melihat bahwa hanya tuhanlah yang dapat menghentikan hewan itu di mana saja dikehendakinya
1853270 seterusnya mereka sampai ke muhammad mengikatkan hewan kendaraannya itu di puing puing kuil sulaiman ia bersembahyang bersama sama ibrahim musa dan isa kemudian dibawakan tangga yang lalu dipancangkan diatas batu yaqub dengan tangga itu muhammad cepat cepat naik ke langit
1853271 langit pertama terbuat dari perak murni dengan bintang bintang yang digantungkan dengan rantai rantai emas
1853272 langit ketujuh adalah tempat orang orang yang adil dengan malaikat yang lebih besar dari bumi ini seluruhnya
1853273 sementara ia sedang merenungkan makhluk makhluk ajaib itu tiba tiba ia membubung lagi sampai di yang terletak di sebelah kanan arsy menaungi berjuta juta ruh malaikat
1853274 kemudian terasa lagi ia membubung ke atas ke tempat yang maha tinggi terpesona sekali ia tiba tiba bumi dan langit menjadi satu hampir hampir tak dapat lagi ia melihatnya seolah olah sudah hilang tertelan keduanya tampak hanya sebesar biji bijian di tengah tengah ladang yang membentang luas
1853275 kemudian lagi ia sudah berada di hadapan arsy sudah dekat sekali
1853276 sesudah berbicara tuhan memerintahkan hambanya itu supaya setiap muslim setiap hari sembahyang limapuluh kali begitu muhammad kembali turun dari langit ia bertemu dengan musa musa berkata kepadanya
1853277 bagaimana kauharapkan pengikut pengikutmu akan dapat melakukan salat limapuluh kali tiap hari sebelum engkau aku sudah punya pengalaman sudah kucoba terhadap anak anak israil sejauh yang dapat kulakukan percayalah dan kembali kepada tuhan minta supaya dikurangi jumlah sembahyang itu
1853278 muhammadpun kembali jumlah sembahyang juga lalu dikurangi menjadi empatpuluh tetapi musa menganggap itu masih di luar kemampuan orang disuruhnya lagi nabi penggantinya itu berkali kali kembali kepada tuhan sehingga berakhir dengan ketentuan yang lima kali
1853279 sekarang jibril membawa nabi mengunjungi surga yang sudah disediakan sesudah hari kebangkitan bagi mereka yang teguh iman kemudian muhammad kembali dengan tangga itu ke bumi buraqpun dilepaskan lalu ia kembali dari ke mekah naik hewan bersayap
1853280 kemudian kulihat orang orang bermoncong seperti moncong unta tangan mereka memegang segumpal api seperti batu batu lalu dilemparkan ke dalam mulut mereka dan keluar dari dubur
1853281 mereka yang memakan harta anak anak yatim secara tidak sah
1853282 mereka orang orang yang meninggalkan wanita yang dihalalkan tuhan dan mencari wanita yang diharamkan
1853283 mereka itu wanita yang memasukkan laki laki lain bukan dari keluarga mereka
1853284 sungguh aku ini manusia seperti kamu juga yang diberikan wahyu kepadaku tetapi tuhanmu adalah tuhan yang esa
1853285 bahwasanya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa orang yang mempersekutukannya tetapi dia mengampuni segala dosa selain syirik itu siapa saja yang dikehendakinya
1853286 tentu dia bicara yang sebenarnya dia mengatakan kepadaku bahwa ada berita dari tuhan dari langit ke bumi pada waktu malam atau siang aku percaya ini lebih lagi dari yang kamu herankan

1853332 cinta hanya masalah waktu saja kau akan sanggup menumbuhkannya selama kau merasa orang yang ada di sampingmu adalah orang yang cocok denganmu
1853333 aku telah memberinya harapan tapi aku tak berani mewujudkan harapan itu
1853334 aku tahu kau mencintainya sangat mencintainya bahkan ini kesempatanmu untuk mendapatkannya datanglah padanya hiburlah dia dia akan membuka pintu hatinya padamu
1853335 cinta akan datang tak harus pada awalnya bisa jadi di tengah perjalanannya atau pada akhirnya
1853336 aku tahu semua sudah terlambat kupikir tak ada salahnya aku menebus semua kesalahanku dulu tapi karena kau menolaknya aku tak bisa berkata apa apa
1853337 dicintai mufti begitu rupa lebih memilih mencintai widi yang ternyata lebih mencintai kecantikan dan kekayaan aya sofia

1853339 dulunya iya aku sangat membencinya kemudian aku mendengar perjuangannya dari abdul kalian tahu kan cinta pertama ita selama ia kerja di sini sayangnya abdul menceritakannya semuanya setelah ia menikah dengan istrinya

1853342 bukankah tadi sudah kukatakan abdul menceritakan semua tentang ita kepadaku
1853343 yang perlu kalian tahu hentikan sikap kalian jangan mengucilkannya ita tak berhak lagi mendapat perlakuan buruk itu hanya akan membuatnya semakin keras kepala dalam menjalani hidupnya ia akan dengan keras hati menghadapi orang orang seperti kalian

1853415 fellow americans id like to stand here and tell you that if you vote for me and my party we have the policies to solve our problems and secure a prosperous and peaceful future however we face problems that defy any easy solution and require americans of all political stripes to work together and think creatively these problems oil dependency massive government deficits a huge trade deficit the de industrialization of our country environmental problems and a risk of fiscal and economic collapse are the result of policies embraced by both parties no one can simply blame the other side moreover weve gotten so comfortable with partisan bashing blaming the evil democrats or the greedy republicans that weve lost sight of the fact the world is too complex for simple this way or that way solution so i cant promise new programs to solve our problems i cant promise no new taxes we have to keep all options on the table as we deal with this impending crisis i can only promise to speak openly about these problems and listen to the various options and possibilities building compromises that allow americans to work together to weather this storm and set the foundation for long term peace and prosperity

1853426 we would actually have a roundabout where traffic can come in and engage and circle through but people actually come to see it as a point of arrival and gathering imagine what if we were to take this traffic circle with a large fountain at the center and buildings describing the perimeter trees wide sidewalks cafes this becomes a destination this becomes a major element of the fabric of the city and its echoed on the far side with one at burnside and sandy at the center is a huge fountain that celebrates life in portland and from this space thats created we can establish a sense of place about who we are like a piazza in rome a place where people come to enjoy life to meet their friends this needs to be a place where we celebrate the city
1853427 the arterial connects us east west and the river connects us north south if you put a pin in portland and wanted spin the city around this is where youd put the pin
1853428 we have a city developing by the path of least resistance
1853429 weve choked our major contributory creek with a freeway because it was easy to run it through there so now weve lost all the natural characteristics weve jammed all this infastructure in in a way that has precluded people from being able to get to their river and remember why they came here in the first place you can see the dramatic difference on one side of the river thats full of development and the other side of the river thats potential development
1853430 every great city started out with great ideas thats how the city grows effectively the most important thing is to design the city create the vision and images for how the city could be weve worked very well on creating solutions for trucks trains and freight movement now its time for the city to go to the next level which is to accomodate human needs
1853431 why do you have no compassion for americans who compete for jobs with these illegal aliens
1853432 approximately 50 of male illegal aliens caught attempting to enter the united states have arrest records

1853434 my ancestors did not steal this country from the indians we stole it from the british
1853435 i and i imagine no one else had a problem with migrant farm workers over the past decades but todays illegal aliens have taken over the building trades
1853436 id like to see this bozo put in a hard days work
1853437 the basis for proposing roundabouts at key intersections in the city and specifically at burnside 23 and burnside sandy is to demonstrate that this strategy can resolve circulation issues at many intesections in the city
1853438 roundabouts are proven to reduce traffic accidents injuries and deaths also they reduce emissions and because traffic flows through them they reduce tensions
1853439 keeping the hood dumpy to get rents lower doesnt make for a good city
1853440 as a society we dont really look at the true cost of all that we do
1853441 as climate change comes to the forefront and as value is placed upon greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation or elimination of those then the cost of projects like this will actually be more directly tied to their value
1853442 thats a watershed moment well face in just a few years
1853443 early opposition was strong but appears to be withering as adjacent property owners support the couplet more and more
1853444 i just had a vision of walking out of whole foods on nw couch street to a jammed packed street full of cars large trucks and exhaust just sitting there trying to get up the west hill
1853445 one of the reasons everett is hostile to pedestrians is that there are many intersections which are unsignaled
1853446 the former westbound lanes will be raised and serve a dual function as protected angle parking during normal days and as closeable pedestrian only plazas for special events

1853462 anything that could remotely please any of your senses because they need to control all that
1853463 when that was always their last big chip when they thought they had the power of life and death
1853464 easy they just let us forget give us too much to process fill up every minute keep us distracted its what the tube is for and though it kills me to say it its what rock and roll is becoming just another way to claim our attention so that beautiful certainty we had starts to fade and after a while they have us convinced all over again that we really are going to die and theyve got us again

1853470 coming down the stretch is going to be really really difficult
1853471 you have to hit a perfect drive on that hole because you dont want to be going into that green over that water out of the rough or out of a bunker
1853472 fortunately you can hit a 3 wood or 2 iron off the tee
1853473 that green is so undulating so scary im just looking forward to hitting the ball on the fairway getting it onto the green and getting away from that hole as soon as possible
1853474 the 17th could be the toughest of the par 3s
1853475 pitching is very important what we saw yesterday showed that if a guy hits his spots you can get beat at any time today they threw a lefty at us again and we went out there and teed off on him
1853476 weve got our own thing going we dont want to do the manny papi thing were going to have a tex vlade thing
1853477 having those guys in the lineup makes it so much easier
1853478 the only thing were doing different now than earlier in the year is that were getting hits
1853479 guys are still doing the same thing theyre just finding holes now
1853480 the great thing about us right now is that on any given night someone can get the big hit
1853481 i dont have to carry this team in fact theres not one guy on this team that has to carry us
1853482 he swings from both sides of the plate with power and can hit for average and if you dont throw a strike hes not swinging
1853483 vlade is a hall of famer and other teams and other pitchers know that
1853484 i mean the guy can get on base anytime he wants to he doesnt even have to swing because theyre not giving him anything good to hit the same pitches he chased and missed early in the season hes crushing em now
1853485 he just didnt locate and didnt have much finish he had teixeira with two strikes in the first inning and left him off the hook then the pitch to guerrero looked like it was on a tee
1853486 you know doing a post doc wouldnt be that bad and then i can go on to have a nice little research lab at an undergrad institution and i think i might really enjoy that

1853498 when you are lost in the harz having hiked as i had 12 miles through thick pine forests and up 1 000 foot peaks twilight can be disorienting terrifying
1853499 wonderful article it reminded me of several visits to the harz mountains although my hiking was less arduous i also delighted in the mysterious other worldly atmosphere of these mountains
1853500 i would like the court to know that i bought the hat for the judge
1853501 mr traitor you are under the cloak of immunity for today only do not show up wearing that jacket again
1853502 i called in the first 10 minutes and got a free hedge trimmer
1853503 i just dont think our internet connection has enough poop
1853504 the nice thing about this program is you just highlight what you want to delete then you delete it
1853505 to seek the savior and respond to the gospel in faith they are made worthy and adopted and then they are saved this is not grace because the salvation of a regenerated child of god is merited
1853506 two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector 11 the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank you that i am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this tax collector 12 i fast twice a week i give tithes of all that i possess 13 and the tax collector standing afar off would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner 14 i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted
1853507 to be a christian i will submit i will love i will work i will forsake all i will exchange mine for his
1853508 the gospel is the message of the christ crucified on the cross on our behalf for our sins buried in the ground and risen and seen again
1853509 because they do not nor indeed can carry the same credibility as the argument for lordship salvation
1853510 being born again into gods family happens to the sinner before they have faith or do anything toward god at all they are born again then god reveals himself and then he gives them the faith to believe in him submit love absolutely
1853511 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god to salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and also for the greek
1853512 1 moreover brethren i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you which also you received and in which you stand 2 by which also you are saved if you hold fast that word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain
1853513 2 thes 1 8 1 peter 1 17 rom 10 16
1853514 so paul says it is a statement of fact that you accepted this
1853515 describes an action which is viewed as having been completed in the past once and for all not needing to be repeated
1853516 it is the object of that belief only if christ is not risen then our belief would be in vain yet the
1853517 anything beyond the basics of the faith 1 cor 3 1 3 yet paul writes of their eternal salvation as an established fact
1853518 unto salvation through faith and that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god 2 tim 3 15 rom 10 17 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god to salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and also for the greek
1853519 moreover brethren i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you which also you received and in which you stand by which also you are saved if you hold fast that word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen by cephas then by the twelve after that he was seen by over five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain to the present but some have fallen asleep after that he was seen by james then by all the apostles then last of all he was seen by me also as by one born out of due time for i am the least of the apostles who am not worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me therefore whether it was i or they so we preach and so you believed
1853520 receives this and the one who does receive it is saved and will eternally stand on these grounds and this is the power of god unto salvation
1853521 what are you talking about your post reads more like a commercial for your websites than it does a response to the article you have placed it under
1853522 the wind blows where man decides by believing in me and we know it goes to all who believe in me
1853523 the wind blows where man decides by believing in me and we know it goes to all who believe in me
1853524 i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
1853525 this is just exactly the same thing said in john 3
1853526 god acted and made dead sinners alive while they were still spiritually dead sinners do not make themselves alive and come to faith and then have god cause them to be born again and give them a new nature
1853527 while paul does not go into great detail the by grace you have been saved includes the exercise of faith that comes after being made alive spiritually
1853528 can mean only one thing he has been regenerated indwelt by the holy sprit and therefore he has been born again so we have clear statements from jazzy stating that he believes the lost are born again prior to and apart from personal faith in christ
1853529 well i agree that men are rebellious towards god but i also believe that christ draws all men unto himself and so everyone has equal opportunity to believe him
1853530 yes all men run away from god but god does the drawing of all men therefore it can be clearly seen that the one who comes to the light his deeds have been carried out by god
1853531 this what the bible says and each and every apostle jesus christ sent to bare testimony of him and his death burial and resurrection this gospel truly is the power of god unto salvation and here it is declared in detail by the apostle paul himself under inspiration of god the holy spirit
1853532 and he the holy spirit when he comes will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment concerning sin because they do not believe in me
1853533 therefore your view jazzys teaches that not even faith is required to be saved
1853534 i do not agree with tulip however that is not what this article the power of god to salvation is about
1853535 invitation to salvation directed to those who are not saved
1853536 a person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven
1853537 well i agree that men are rebellious towards god but i also believe that christ draws all men unto himself and so everyone has equal opportunity to believe him
1853538 i am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
1853539 i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds
1853540 for they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you and how you turned to god from idols sin to serve the living and true god
1853541 aware of how evil they are and how good god is
1853542 for those who do wicked things again every man hate the light and do not come to the light but those who do what is true come to the light that it may be clearly seen his deeds have been wrought in god
1853543 aware of how evil they are and how good god is
1853544 i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds
1853545 that is why the jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me
1853546 i will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses and from your idols i will cleanse you and i will give you a new heart and a new spirit i will put within you and i will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules
1853547 turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth
1853548 please think about why you believed believe the gospel when so many others refuse every day kev
1853549 whoever would come after me must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
1853550 i preached that they should repent and turn to god and
1853551 that is why the jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me
1853552 i will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses and from your idols i will cleanse you
1853553 turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth
1853554 look to me and be saved all you ends of the earth for i am god and there is no other
1853555 make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole and it shall be that everyone who is bitten when he looks at it shall live
1853556 he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
1853557 whoever would come after me must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
1853558 well i know that he wont interpret it that way anyway
1853559 if you are believing that your faith is a result of gods grace a decision you freely made then you are taking partial credit for your salvation
1853560 what shall we do that we may work the works of god
1853561 this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he sent
1853562 this is the work of god that you swing a hammer
1853563 for everyone who has been born of god overcomes the world
1853564 i am sure of this that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of jesus christ
1853565 now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord
1853566 my salvation is not dependent on his continued work in my life
1853567 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
1853568 now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons
1853569 if our salvation were not dependent on our on going faith he would not have said in col 1 21 23
1853570 and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him if indeed you continue in the faith stable and steadfast not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard
1853571 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ
1853572 my salvation is not dependent on his continued work in my life
1853573 because i have faith in this ive been baptized into his death and his death has become mine
1853574 and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for
1853575 for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god for
1853576 in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which comes through faith in christ
1853577 and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him
1853578 now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons
1853579 he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you who by gods power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
1853580 and i am sure of this that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of jesus christ
1853581 it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not of yourselves
1853582 its not really works if god does it through me
1853583 did i say anything different what must i do to be saved believe
1853584 this idea that people can somehow take credit for their faith is a smoke screen
1853585 an excuse to bring works salvation through the back door
1853586 just as david also speaks of the blessing of the one whom god counts righteousness apart from works
1853587 for by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
1853588 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
1853589 but the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing but to us who
1853590 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
1853591 did i say anything different what must i do to be saved believe
1853592 this idea that people can somehow take credit for their faith is a smoke screen
1853593 an excuse to bring works salvation through the back door
1853594 just as david also speaks of the blessing of the one whom god counts righteousness apart from works
1853595 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race
1853596 this is another totally unfair accusation did i not answer the question point blank when you said to me
1853597 for the purposes of this discussion lets say i did
1853598 my salvation depends on could not be possible without the gospel
1853599 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
1853600 for the purposes of this discussion lets say i did
1853601 two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector 11 the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank you that i am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this tax collector 12 i fast twice a week i give tithes of all that i possess 13 and the tax collector standing afar off would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner 14 i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted
1853602 abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness
1853603 well as long as you say you believed at one point then your name is written in the lambs book of life god be with you brother
1853604 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be save
1853605 hey honey do you believe that christ died for you was buried and rose to life again
1853606 good then your name is written in the lambs book of life dont worry that you dont ever read your bible or that you never pray and dont even believe in prayer and dont worry that you have no love for christ or desire to know him that just means youll lose crowns in heaven
1853607 paul is defending his apostleship the test is christ in you because if he is then paul is an apostle
1853608 he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death if indeed you continue in the faith first you told me your faith had to be maintained then you told me it didnt now i think youre saying it does but im just not sure anymore
1853609 this is what you must be willing to do this is true faith this is how you should act
1853610 hungry and thirsty for new life but he just hasnt had a reason to hope
1853611 i want to get out of hell i just dont want to get out of hell to spend it with jesus
1853612 hungry and thirsty for new life but he just hasnt had a reason to hope
1853613 laid it all down at the foot of the cross
1853614 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved you and your household
1853615 your husband is not professing faith he is professing intellectual understanding of a historical event to some degree
1853616 what good is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but does not have works can that faith save him but someone will say you have faith and i have works show me your faith apart from your works and i will show you my faith by my works you believe that god is one you do well even the demons believe and shudder do you want to be shown you foolish person that faith apart from works is useless was not abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son isaac on the altar you see that faith was completed by his works
1853617 they have healed the wound of my people lightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
1853618 what good is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but does not have works can that faith save him but someone will say you have faith and i have works show me your faith apart from your works and i will show you my faith by my works you believe that god is one you do well even the demons believe and shudder do you want to be shown you foolish person that faith apart from works is useless was not abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son isaac on the altar you see that faith was completed by his works
1853619 when i first had sex with hostess tracy ballucci i thought she was the one
1853620 two months later i had sex with katie but i still had to work with tracy i shouldve learned my lesson when tracy accidentally threw away a shrimp scampi that was supposed to go to a 14 top but its a little too late now since theres not a waitress left that i havent slept with
1853621 hello there come on in can i get you a drink some good food how about a massage
1853622 look around what do you see nothing look again dear give it a minute i know close your eyes and think of butterflies whats that dear total tranquility i think so candlelight in the room the fragrance of flowers in the air soft smooth silk for you to lay on the feel of the softest 1970s shag carpet between your toes
1853623 imagine a place you would most like to be and like magic you have just now entered that place
1853624 oh you do yes i like to listen to the sound of rain myself
1853625 here let me give you a pillow aahhh yes that is better now isnt it
1853626 i thank god that my children are safe while my home and possessions can be replaced we are all devastated as a family over the loss of our beloved pets i have dedicated my life to saving abandoned and homeless animals and have never felt more helpless in my life
1853627 i thank everyone for their well wishes and prayers at this difficult time for our family
1853628 hey if i went to your house and your mom made something really good i wouldnt eat just one bowl
1853629 when other countries host the olympic games they do it to make money but look at china its only for face
1853630 i guess its ok for this presidential candidate to be behind closed doors raising money but its not ok to be out front associating with the families of our soldiers
1853631 i think that shows bad judgment for someone expecting to be in charge and commander in chief of our military forces
1853632 put it this way it hasnt happened in the year and a half since ive been here
1853633 it seemed ironic to me because i thought the fake boot camp was nothing like a real boot camp
1853634 its about 10 times harder you guys from experience i can tell you firsthand
1853635 the idea for this movie is what happens when a bunch of actors get stuck out in the jungle in a real world situation because us actors most of us are what wussies
1853636 sorry we couldnt get some explosions going off in the background
1853637 and thank you for everything you do protecting our country

1853641 s immaginavo che una civilt come la vostra si rivelasse nelle comodit di sicuro non fate molto movimento
1853642 non credevo che ti saresti spaventato da quel poco che ho visto di questo mondo siete abituati a parlare con voci prive di corpo
1853643 ho notato che il problema della temperatura molto sentito qui da voi forse perch ve ne fate una colpa
1853644 disquisire forse questa la chiave voi metabolizzate i vostri errori con le parole anche se tu non sei molto loquace
1853645 eppure non sembri spaventato dalle responsabilit sei ci che voi definite una persona affidabile
1853646 se fosse vero avrei corso il rischio di legarmi a una donna avrei messo su famiglia
1853647 s lo capisco siete cos evoluti da confezionarvi le vostre illusioni
1853648 non so da dove vieni ma chiamarla evoluzione mi pare un grosso errore
1853649 stai cercando di scoraggiarmi eppure lo so che avete molto da insegnare
1853650 hai sbagliato persona io posso solo insegnarti a essere uno schifoso egoista
1853651 il concetto di egoismo esattamente ci di cui abbiamo bisogno
1853652 e da dove dovrei cominciare questo pianeta va a rotoli
1853653 perch ognuno di noi pensa solo ai pochi centimetri quadrati di terra che riesce a calpestare
1853654 e che alla fine difficile stabilire dove debba finire il proprio egoismo per lasciar spazio a quello degli altri

1853656 were being taken for fools by the iraqi government that continues to take in american money to pay for their reconstruction
1853657 their excuse is they dont have a bureaucracy thats capable of writing checks
1853658 thats about as feeble an excuse it would be laughable if it werent so serious
1853659 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills is a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1853660 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1853661 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1853662 we are praying for the swift recovery of all the victims and our hearts go out to their loved ones
1853663 theyre the best experts to predict what theyre going to need to manage their area of operation
1853664 as far as the activity going on here in san diego the agents are needed
1853665 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1853666 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1853667 would have screamed bloody murder if the border patrol had reduced san diego sector staffing levels appreciably
1853668 given the canadian teams relatively larger size compared to athens and with good medal prospects in about 10 sports i believe we could get 15 to 17 medals
1853669 i dont see the point in sending 300 plus athletes to these games if well only win about 12 medals
1853670 i am pretty confidentthat we will earn 20 to 40 medals and we will be in the top 15
1853671 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1853672 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1853673 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1853674 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1853675 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1853676 but they shouldnt have destroyed my house evicted me and left me homeless
1853677 a waiver is required for a member to go beyond 1 095 days in a rolling 1 460 day period
1853678 we have numerous volunteers and we want to encourage volunteerism
1853679 i am not a usu graduate but have had the pleasure of working with these students for the past eight years
1853680 and personally consider them to be among the best medical students in the country i am extremely honored to have been selected by them
1853681 i have always enjoyed the teaching opportunities provided to me in the military medical system and consider it a privilege to be in a position to influence young physicians
1853682 personally i think the award speaks more to the excellent overall teaching environment that the usu representatives provide here at wilford hall than anything i have done individually
1853683 as long as were over here well always professionally develop our people
1853684 and its because of the commitment of our members who put this on that we can do this
1853685 it was a very worthwhile day of reflection on our accomplishments and insight into our future responsibilities and expectations from others
1853686 the senior nco induction ceremony is a major stepping stone for the enlisted force
1853687 it is the crossing over the bridge between being a noncommissioned officer and a senior noncommissioned officer the importance of the ceremony is for the inductees to realize the importance and be recognized by their new top 3 tier
1853688 they are supporting the mission and thats what its all about
1853689 when a leader has earned authority others willingly follow even in the most difficult times and situations
1853690 inductees we are taking a day away from the war to mentor to you help you prepare for your future role as a senior nco
1853691 i feel you are prepared the question now comes from within inductees are you ready to join the senior noncommissioned officer corps
1853692 as it states in the senior noncommissioned officer charge personal professional growth never ends
1853693 we believe that charge must be upheld even in our deployed environment our mission success depends on it thats how we succeed we have some of the best professionals out there every day making it happen
1853694 as an infectious disease doctor ive always felt that a vaccine is that ultimate victory in our war against bugs
1853695 i think this month we really want to focus on the full spectrum from the newborn to the older person and the importance of vaccines and understanding when those are due throughout your life
1853696 because we have the vaccines doesnt mean they get used
1853697 we have a great opportunity to share tactics and training opportunities with the 961st aacs as we fly together over the republic of korea during the ore
1853698 the joint stars aircraft contributes in a lot of ways from developing targets of opportunity for attack operations to supporting personnel recovery operations
1853699 we use a crew normally consisting of 21 air force and army personnel to detect track report and target enemy ground movement while employing various radar modes computer subsystems and an extensive communications suite
1853700 when you start putting these two pictures together you get a lot of situational awareness of enemy activity for faster operational and tactical level decisions
1853701 though we both units have unique missions its the synergistic effect of combining the assets that makes the impact in the battle space

1853705 i would love to sit down have a cup of tea and talk with this woman
1853706 looked as if god had switched her nose with the beak of a toucan
1853707 it does not matter what we eat or whether we are muslim christian or jewish its how we treat our fellow man that counts
1853708 ive experienced many terrible things in life a few of which actually happened
1853709 men often hate each other because they fear each other they fear each other because they dont know each other they dont know each other because they can not communicate they can not communicate because they are separated
1853710 darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that
1853711 you can see who someone was is by what they did do in life
1853712 what you do doesnt define who you are who you are defines what you will do
1853713 if i only had that girl guy life would be awesome
1853714 if i only had a million dollars that car the boat
1853715 sorry little cuz but i had to take care of my garden tonight if i missed it then hey i just missed it so what
1853716 from now on i am going to be there for each and every one of my relatives like us a amp s trains should and always do were not called trains for nothing we stick together through thick and thin for life i am not a human so i should never do something that humans do to their relatives and that is focusing on other things instead of family

1853726 our data just didnt fit the current model of damage accumulation and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift
1853727 we found a normal developmental program that works in young animals but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older
1853728 it accounts for the lions share of molecular differences between young and old worms
1853729 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
1853730 a free radical doesnt care if its in a human cell or a worm cell
1853731 the take home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells
1853732 this is a new and potentially powerful circuit that has just been discovered for doing that
1853733 its a new way to think about how to slow the aging process

1853741 hurry there isnt any time to fool around come on abby
1853742 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
1853743 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
1853744 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
1853745 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
1853746 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
1853747 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version
1853748 we are not going to switch to domestic sales because the domestic market is even worse
1853749 there are still some profits in this industry but they are squeezed
1853750 i dont think they have come to the definite conclusion that we are having a sharp slowdown in growth but they are clearly cautious they do not want to re ignite inflation pressure
1853751 i think there is a bit of gridlock and not a lot of consensus about what to do
1853752 for some senior leaders who have come out and taken personal responsibility for the issues they face some career pressures
1853753 it is subscribing to something i regard not to be science
1853754 if conventional doping testing were to be submitted to a regulatory agency such as the u s food and drug admin istration to qualify as a diagnostic test for a disease it would be rejected
1853755 this is a black box with little people running around and we do not know what they are doing this area needs some fresh air it is just anti science not only in its conduct but in its attitude
1853756 it seems like a closed process by which they set these things up they say if somebody is above a certain range the chance of a false positive is one in a billion but you never see the data to support that
1853757 the detection methods undergo rigorous validation prior to being introduced this reliability has been consistently confirmed by tribunals
1853758 it would be useful and very valuable but very expensive
1853759 within a month thered be a book published on how to beat standardized testing procedures
1853760 we have a group of people trying to circumvent testing its unlike any other field i can think of
1853761 the whole testing operation benefits from involvement of first rate scientists and the critique scientists can give
1853762 when i see things i do not agree with i sometimes pass it off but if it affects people it bothers me it eats at me
1853763 recognizing the crap i will go through this is worth it to me we all want to make a difference

1853773 our understanding of the science of cyber electronics is relatively immature at this point
1853774 it includes the study of both the physical and the virtual
1853775 theres been some tremendous things going on especially in iraq and afghanistan where electronic warfare has helped in the operations and in limiting and reducing the deaths in theater
1853776 cyber electronics could include or have distinct relationships between things that we call network operations network warfare computer network operations space superiority electronic warfare and the electromagnetic spectrum operations
1853777 each represents a different slice of the cyber electronic continuum within which different capabilities must exist
1853778 there is no nation state border where were talking now
1853779 there are nation state sponsors and we have to look at it in terms of nation state sponsors as well as those who are not nation state sponsors i might call them cyber state sponsors who are really developing on their own out there

1853790 eraserheads reunion concert 2008 eheads practice tickets doh issues and another strike
1853791 he wasnt the best player ive ever had in terms of ability but in terms of influence he was the best player
1853792 he was a fantastic influence with the determination to win fire and everything you would expect
1853793 through certain i wouldnt say limited ability not true that good ability but not the ability of a cantona a giggs or a scholes they could take themselves above that with drive and ambition to get there even in sprint sessions roy was not the quickest but if you put a ball there he was the quickest to the ball
1853794 i think thats one of the things that makes me proud of being manager of our football club and it tells you what a great club we are when we have players come back to play against us or in the case of roy tomorrow and in the last few years bryan robson mark hughes and steve bruce coming back as managers they get a fantastic reception
1853795 i dont think hell be starting but he is such an important player when he comes off the bench too
1853796 yeh i was still celebrating the first goal when the second one went in and was confused at the replay too
1853797 i would like to thank the manager the coaching and medical staff and most of all the supporters who have supported me through my career
1853798 they have been fantastic and were a real inspiration to me when i was out injured the support the fans and the staff showed me during that time was the main motivation for me making my comeback i feel proud to have represented manchester united for 11 years and have some very special memories
1853799 the daily telegraph prioritised scandal over sense permitting ex liverpool defender alan hansen to devote his entire column to the apparent conspiracy hansens version of events is so myopic that it borders on a lie the entire 700 word piece collapse on the fallibility of his centre tenet that wes brown clearly handled the ball firstly from webbs vantage point brown clearly did not handle secondly replays are inconclusive and tend to suggest as the player insisted that the ball struck his chest that too was the verdict from hansens colleagues on motd presumably hansen was among those seething liverpool supporters who demanded an apology from rob styles last week it will be fascinating to learn if an apology to webb is forthcoming from hansen later this week

1853844 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities
1853845 in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls
1853846 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government

1853851 we are pleased to be collaborating with the cowen group in bringing this highly useful survey information to our readers and the industry at large
1853852 we are thrilled to be working with litigation support today they are a very well respected media organization within the litigation support community and together we aim to extend our reach in getting the word out to key people in the industry at large
1853853 the industry is changing rapidly and we hope this survey provides vital information to allow litigation support professionals to adequately plan and track their career growth and for managers to hire and retain the right people for their needs

1853920 most companies would call themselves innovative and would claim theyre delivering an above average service to their customers yet their customers opinions might differ if you drill a company on their innovation practices they would probably mention two approaches they employ 1 their research department meets with target groups compiles presentations for the upper management which then occasionally hands those reports over to the development department 2 their research or marketing department comes up with competitive matrix of the products available from competition in a meeting then executives see that their product is missing a feature and hence the development department is assigned the task of adding an internet enabled installer to the product since everybody else offers them thereby creating market expectations
1853921 excuse me gentlemen i have been making you wait i just arrived from bener meriah i had a little bit business
1853922 the demand for ala extension became our parent motivation including my father abubakar bintang head of indonesia national party pni since 1945 they have been struggling for it however it never occurred as aceh was in war ranging from dutch to gerakan aceh merdeka free aceh movement
1853923 as head of village please do tell your population tell them that acehnese people in the hinterland where located in five districts were demanding to establish new province therefore we could take good care of the people if there come any support let us together go to jakarta we will give our support to the commission ii in house of representative dpr to signing the law of government of ala
1853924 i suggest all of village headman to gather before we go to jakarta some of them have not known yet about our struggle of ala province establishment we have to brief them first
1853925 we would take some contribution from them at least five thousand rupiah
1853926 number of contribution should note down as well as the identity
1853927 we should make them believe that ala population was endorsing the province establishment
1853928 proposal of the province name was changing for few times but we finally come to ala name in the beginning the name was galaksi it is an acronym of gayo alas kuala simpang singkil it changed to gats with similar acronym to galaksi late kuala simpang or aceh tamiang was canceled its membership
1853929 ala establishment initiative had been discussed since abdurrahman wahid former president of indonesia it examined during his successor megawati soekarno putri then we hope it will establish in early times of the next president susilo bambang yudhoyono
1853930 during the meeting in my house in jakarta the board of committee agreed to let the extension initiative settle for a moment we did not want to bother the government focus on peace signing process and aceh recovery after the disaster
1853931 then the committee members were joining back together we will escort the parliament to examine acehs new province establishment
1853932 at that time rooms of all hotels in the city was full
1853933 no matter what the story goes as long as we were joining together with the coastal population we as the hinterland people will have no chance to be a leader in banda aceh our relationship is like water and oil
1853934 goods were very expensive gasoline price is breach to rp 10 000 per liter
1853935 if there are five or more children in a family its parent attention must be divided the parent would have to work hard making a living well if one of the children decided to separate maybe he wants to go abroad it will reduce the parents burden the kid will relieved try to be autonomous and make less the parents burden
1853936 aceh province should act as if as taman mini indonesia indah indonesia miniatur garden varieties of ethnic should put into one place embraced the bureaucracy at least should be like that
1853937 the extension is also part of aspiration the parliament should listen for it
1853938 the chance is open if there is a letter from the president
1853939 the accord was only prevailing between gam and indonesia government it was not international treaty since there is no parliament agreement therefore it could not be taken as legal base to administer indonesias internal affairs including aceh
1853940 it is issues of elites money and political interest are very clear in this issue if there is a new province there will be a new governor legislators and positions in the bureaucracy however the good answer is accelerating the development which reaching all of aceh region people only concern whether they could work well
1853941 it is an instrument of campaign as well we glued at houses village offices therefore our grand children will acknowledge alas region
1853942 it is really really located right in the heart of aceh
1853943 i made the map i traveled around aceh for one and a half years to mapping alas region digitally using gps however i did not go everyday
1853944 besides geographic factors in five districts i used ethnographic referential gayo is main referential wherever gayonese majority lived in it included to alas region
1853945 somebody who has objections could please to charge im ready for it
1853946 the ethnics which lived in ala are minority in aceh region we lived in upland and hinterland as well
1853947 so if somebody asked who the native of aceh is we are we had resemblances to aborigin in australia continent we are marginalizing
1853948 after a year of irwandi yusuf governing aceh the roads remain damage
1853949 but look how many times did irwandi come to see people in hinterland region particularly to visit us who lived in the highland since aceh is very wide we ask to separate
1853950 please could you tell me whether any articles in loga that point out the extension of aceh region is forbidden loga should obey the highest rule in this country the level of loga is not as high as other law for example the law of local extension
1853951 remember aceh isnt being a free country yet we are being the part of nkri when we asked to establish a new province it is legal and its our right
1853952 then why we could not be autonomous whereas we are indeed part of the nkri we never resist against the state
1853953 the government was dominated by arabs india campa keling tamil please check in the governor office how many gayonese there is it caused of we are incapable to be a leader in java many gayonese were being a leader im sorry our ancestor used to be a leader of the coast
1853954 or nine ancestors seven headman the title of the book that already translated to bahasa is
1853955 we used to feed the coastal people during the war against dutch when panglima polem and cut nyak dhien was forced to gayo they sheltered there
1853956 i am your senior while were in amm aceh monitoring mission you used to be my staff in the district you must obey what has written down in the helsinki accord do not give any comment
1853957 until now bang big brother irwandi still phones me sometime he asked me to meet him in banda aceh every time he asked about aceh tengah i always gave him views and recommendation
1853958 no problem it is part of democracy however we are committed to the helsinki accord it means some elites who demand regional extension are not happy to the peace accord they are provocateurs who want to break the peace in aceh
1853959 gam already had a province i am the governor of gam in linges region but i havent had the office yet
1853960 when the accord ended we would have demanded position acehs elites where the province that wali nanggroe hasan tiro has been promising the guerillas have been fighting and turning down from the jungle so we have no business to the central government if they were forcing to establish new province in aceh now that showed they hate gam struggle
1853961 we havent making any move yet we just keep silence for a while if we all of kpa aceh transition committee member held mass demonstration in banda aceh the story would be different
1853962 however if they resolved to establish an ala province they must defeat gam combatants in aceh tengah and bener meriah districts killed us first so that would not considered as breaking the peace accord however since we are tight up with the accord they should invite us to join
1853963 if the central government approved ala establishment there will be a chaos the war could have not be avoided it will be bigger than the last

1853965 with gas prices at an all time high and our energy security resting in the hands of hostile foreign nations we need to be giving americans greater access to biofuels at the pump
1853966 this bill helps gas station owners play an active role in furthering the development of the burgeoning biofuels industry and gives consumers the option to utilize clean sources of fuel that support south dakotas rural economies and encourage american energy independence
1853967 i understand there is an expense when installing e 85 pumps and the ease of adding an e 85 pump varies based on the existing underground infrastructure
1853968 but this legislation will help provide station owners an incentive to sell this american made fuel

1854141 larval activity and growth slowed considerably as the mean daytime temperature dropped below 25 c april september observations indicated that larvae seldom pupated at such temperatures however after transfer to 30 c some of the larvae used in the sludge processing experiments see below then pupated and adults later emerged
1854142 high insect yield 8 by dry weight i e similar to earthworm systems
1854143 roughly 20 by weight of the fresh food waste converted into fresh larvae this food waste had an average dry matter content of 37 and the prepupae had an average dry matter content of 44 on a dry matter basis the bioconversion of food waste situates at almost 24
1854144 black soldier fly larvae converted manure in a 460 hen facility to self collected prepupal biomass at a 7 8 d m basis rate sheppard et al 1994 which would represent 58 tons from 100 000 hens in 5 months
1854145 in a recent study with swine the authors observed 15 d m conversion of manure to black soldier fly prepupae
1854146 research by engineering separation and recycling l l c of washington la found a 24 d m conversion of food waste to soldier fly prepupal biomass
1854147 the larvae tolerate a wide range of ph and will survive well in compost derived exclusively from decomposing citrus fruits this finding is consistent with published data where one species of stratiomyidae was found in water at ph 5 7 brues 1928 1
1854148 while the larvae consumed all types of vegetable foods both natural and processed they had a limited ability to remove animal products meat and fat even when these represented less than 10 percent of the food available in the laboratory
1854149 the larvae tolerate saturated conditions well but large larvae lose weight at approximately 1 per hour at 75 5 relative humidity as expected the rate of water loss increases with decreasing relative humidity smaller larvae are more susceptible to water loss losing approximately 1 5 body weight per hour at 75 5 rh
1854150 found that the maximum development rates for soldier flies in dung occurs at 70 moisture levels
1854151 hoy pers comm suggests that adults avoid oviposition sites that are anaerobic
1854152 based on observations made at caboolture sewage treatment plant soldier flies do not lay their eggs in sewage sludge piles insect larvae were found but these proved to be representatives of other fly species under experimental conditions indoors described below adults did not lay in open containers of sewage sludge
1854153 larvae can operate 6 to 8 inches below the surface at lower depths they accomplish very little bioconversion
1854154 the black soldier fly bsf is a southern native non pest fly that unlike the house fly is not attracted to human habitation or foods furman et al
1854155 newly emerged soldier flies mate in flight soon afterwards females begin to deposit egg masses near edges of decaying organic matter eggs incubate 4 days to 3 weeks before hatching

1854176 king arthur is a mythical character who was invented at a certain point in history for essentially political reasons
1854177 if he had really existed there would be more concrete historical traces of him
1854178 these stories deal with universal themes the earliest fragments of the tales can be traced back to wales in the seventh century
1854179 but by the 13th century stories based on the arthurian legends were being told right across europe
1854180 it would be out of the question for us to say that
1854181 arthur was an english king who united all of the britons in the british isles and in brittany against the saxons

1854183 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited

1854185 i would reiterate that ill be happy if im top 5 i dont think im in it to win it as they say
1854186 i dont think lance does anything on a lark i think hell be prepared
1854187 i dont know how prepared floyd was last year what im saying is if we were equally prepared i just cant see where those guys wouldnt pummel me
1854188 dave wiens is super human hes just as fantastic on mountain bikes as lance armstrong is on road bikes
1854189 i dont know if i can beat wiens but im 100 percent sure i can beat carmichael
1854190 i will be home showered and probably three beers in by the time carmichael gets back
1854191 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players
1854192 the luxury tax in the nba has put a crimp on what teams can spend so players are looking for alternatives
1854193 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
1854194 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
1854195 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that caliber
1854196 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
1854197 it just shows you what a global game basketball is that there are good leagues and leagues that are willing to pay for high caliber talent
1854198 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment
1854199 without there being a players association and a collective bargaining agreement in europe theres nothing behind the contract to enforce them other than to go to court
1854200 for europe to truly get to the point where they can compete with the nba for all kinds of players theyre going to have to implement a system where theres a lot more comfort that the contracts are truly guaranteed once that happens then i think youll truly see great competition for players
1854201 we could have came to an agreement last year so i think thats the window of opportunity for a lot of teams
1854202 there is something wrong with america how are you so idiotic

1854207 it looks as though the hd mandate is not off the table however it does appear based a new filing that the commission will take it up as a seperate issue following the merger approval
1854208 i also like the comment that radios response should be to
1854209 why the fccs treatment of the xm sirius merger is an abomination
1854210 on top of that the fcc will embark on a new initiative to explore the possibility of including hd radio functionality into the xm and sirius radios that said it didnt go so far as to make it a requirement just yet and while some believe that this deal is a major blow to terrestrial radio i think that argument is hogwash the reality of the situation is that xm and sirius were led around by the nose while the fcc and companies like clear channel did everything they could to weaken the two firms

1854235 i think its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand
1854236 while we certainly have many scenes throughout the halo series that are scripted in game moments a lot of time players dont experience it or they dont see the thing going on or they maybe dont experience it in quite the same way that we expected them to

1854257 there were people who were driving by and stopped and were throwing rocks to get the bear off of her
1854258 but the bear was still there so they were still throwing rocks but it wouldnt go away
1854259 she knew what was happening when it started coming at her again she got up
1854260 its normal bear habitat and the problem with that residential area is that theres a lot of people who dont store their garbage properly it draws in the bears from their natural habitat and it puts people at risk
1854261 but if she faced it and stood there thats probably a more preventive action to take

1854420 after we confronted him about seeing rielle edwards looked like a deer caught in headlights
1854421 he was clearly surprised that we had caught him at this very late hour inside the hotel
1854422 some guests up at this late hour watched the spectacle in amusement from a staircase nearby
1854423 anyone who knows me knows that i have been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years

1854426 say for instance that the police know that a sniper killer wears a particular type of shoe that he owns a particular type of sweater and that he reads elmore leonard novels once police obtain the credit card numbers of those who bought say the type of sweater found at the murder scene they can trace other purchases made with the same card to see if the relevant type of shoe or book was bought by any of the same people of course if there is a match on one or more of the three items the surveillance may then turn into a target driven investigation

1854435 how do we make sure that the police refrain from using cameras in a discriminatory fashion self reports probably will not work how might we ensure access to the information necessary for accountability david brin has argued that the best way to control the government and everyone else in a surveillance happy transparent society is to watch the watchers camera tapes could be audited periodically or the watchers really could be watched by cameras that method would not only capture the facts necessary to determine whether conduct of surveillance standards are obeyed but also bring home to operators the panoptic effects their surveillance has on others thus perhaps curbing voyeuristic and other unnecessary observation

1854459 all of jobs ten children are killed his vast herds of sheep asses and camels are stolen or slaughtered his home is destroyed by a great wind but throughout all his job did not sin he did not charge god with unreason
1854460 turns on eliphaz as disloyal devotion is due from his friends to one who despairs and loses faith in the almighty
1854461 indeed this i know for truth that no man can win his case against god
1854462 if the appeal is to force see how strong he is if to justice who can compel him to give me a hearing
1854463 know then that god exacts from you less than you deserve
1854464 i wish you would keep strictly silent that would be wisdom for you
1854465 let me but call a witness in my defense let the almighty state his case against me if my accuse had written out his indictment i would not keep silent and remain indoors no i would flaunt it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown on my head i would plead the whole record of my life and present that in court as my defense
1854466 the lord apparently fed up with unending complaints about his misfeasance in office
1854467 what reply can i give thee i who carry no weight i put my finger to my lips
1854468 dare you deny that i am just or put me in the wrong that you may be right
1854469 i have spoken of great things which i have not understood things too wonderful for me to know
1854470 because you have not spoken as you ought about me as my servant job has done
1854471 thereafter job lived another hundred and forty years he saw his sons and grandsons to four generations and died at a very great age
1854472 1 dont ask god for any favors 2 god is not a just god or an unjust god god is just god 3 gods ways are not mans ways 4 dont blame the victim suffering is no evidence of sin
1854473 he rerooted religion in real life by taking god entirely out of moral law enforcement
1854474 in the author of jobs revision of the world god could make commandments available to humanity that would help him bring the order of goodness to the anarchy of the jungle
1854475 you realize by now the part you played to stultify the deuteronomist and change the nature of religious thought my thanks to you for releasing me from moral bondage to the human race
1854476 the book of job endorses the vassals right to make demands on his lord that not only inspired ecclesiastical artistic and political rebels to resist totalitarianism but fanned controversies about the flow of fidelity up and down when we pledge allegiance we demand allegiance
1854477 oh my heck its going to be a wild ride
1854478 id much rather go naked than ever put a dead animal on my body
1854479 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
1854480 what some people think is pretty is actually something thats very gruesome and gross
1854481 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
1854482 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked
1854483 amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced so we went ahead and arranged something else we never knew if we were going to be stopped at any point
1854484 it was a sexy ad really designed for the us market it was positive and it was supposed to be done in a private function room
1854485 im surprised they were so concerned given weve done similar with asian celebrities in the past
1854486 applies to all facets of show business especially so to actors
1854487 la luna lei pende come un crudele ritratto dolci venti sospirano le preghiere degli alberi mentre questa tragedia ha inizio con un infranto cuore di vetro e con lincubo di mezzanotte con il passo pesante dei sogni ma avanti niente lacrime per favore paura e dolore possano accompagnare la morte ma il desiderio che guida la sua certezza come noi vedremo
1854488 mai separarci per paura che il geloso cielo rapisca i nostri cuori
1854489 torna da me sono nato innamorato di te quindi perch il fato dovrebbe interferire
1854490 ill be a kid in a candy store ill be a kid in a store with a lot of candy im going to dance with the stars
1854491 what is not being said is more important than what is being said
1854492 just when was the moment when the republican party became the party of borrowing as a means of balancing a budget
1854493 j tive o prazer de assistir bel ssimas performances envolvendo harm nicas vulgo gaitas
1854494 tidak bukan aku yang mengambil tapi kau yang harus menyerahkannya
1854495 tidak kesabaran didapat dari ketabahan dalam menghadapi cobaan tidak diberikan kau harus meraihnya sendiri
1854496 tidak kuberi keberkahan kebahagiaan tergantung kepadamu sendiri untuk menghargai keberkahan itu
1854497 tidak penderitaan menjauhkanmu dari jerat duniawi dan mendekatkanmu pada ku
1854498 ya allah beri aku segala hal yang menjadikan hidup ini nikmat
1854499 tidak aku beri kau kehidupan supaya kau menikmati segala hal
1854500 im closing tonight so ill probably end up sleeping with assistant manager robert stein
1854501 a few months ago i wouldve been excited hes really cute and coworker lynette hardy says hes a great lay but now i dont know we have nothing in common except that were both working a double and neither of us can stand manager dan musket
1854502 when i first had sex with hostess tracy ballucci i thought she was the one
1854503 two months later i had sex with katie but i still had to work with tracy i shouldve learned my lesson when tracy accidentally threw away a shrimp scampi that was supposed to go to a 14 top but its a little too late now since theres not a waitress left that i havent slept with
1854504 oh kelly spencer i havent had sex with kelly yet
1854505 i dont know how much more of this i can take
1854506 ive gone through every waiter and even two waitresses maybe i should get a new job i definitely need a change
1854507 it might be fun to back him into the walk in cooler and fuck his brains out ive never had sex with anyone from the back of the house before kelly said its pretty hot
1854508 quitting is the best way to break the cycle this behavior is inhibiting her ability to forge permanent relationships and its also keeping her from refilling her customers glasses of ice water
1854509 many former waitstaff members go on to form long term monogamous relationships with people in fields such as telemarketing or hotel management
1854510 almost immediately after i quit i got work at loews cinema
1854511 thats where i met this totally hot usher weve been going out like six weeks
1854512 i went back to the bar at manilla grill last week and i barely had anything to say to those people much less a desire to have sex with them
1854513 two months namin plinano eto yung break ni james sa basketball so super nag ano nag double time talaga ako sa pagte taping para makapunta kami

1854518 two months namin plinano eto yung break ni james sa basketball so super nag ano nag double time talaga ako sa pagte taping para makapunta kami
1854519 sabi niya safe trip enjoy and see nag text kami at six oclock tapos kasi i was off thursday so nag dinner kami tapos yun lang ang balik namin dito august 18 para few days before sa 25th death anniversary ng dad ko ninoy aquino

1854521 prinsipyo ang ipinaglalaban nung tao at nakikiisa ako sa kanya
1854522 i believe in god but i am not sure about jesus my faith is not a significant part of my life
1854523 i believe in jesus and i am working on what it means to get to know him
1854524 i feel realy close to jesus i depend on him for daily guidance
1854525 my relationship with jesus is the most important relationship in my life it influences everything i do
1854526 dissatisfied with the role my church plays in helping me grow spiritually
1854527 please ill be good if you just let me come home
1854528 hey you hardly know me and you invited me in for all you know i could be a rapist
1854529 and i could be that lady in fatal attraction and you just ruined your life
1854530 if the president is allowing us to work with china and have trade relations with them should he also allow gay marriage what would allowing them rights but not the right to marry do for gays
1854531 we were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after
1854532 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1854533 the chinese said they werent required to give a reason
1854534 to me this fits in with the olympics which are about the world coming together for the betterment of mankind
1854535 i was quite surprised i got the visa in the first place
1854536 i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners account for tibetans who have disappeared since the protests in march and engage in meaningful dialogue and genuine autonomy for tibet
1854537 but it does no service to the chinese government and certainly no service to the people of china for the united states and other democracies to pretend that the suppression of rights in china does not concern us it does will and must concern us
1854538 the emergence of an economically vibrant more politically active china offers new opportunities for prosperity and cooperation
1854539 as president i intend to forge a more effective regional framework in asia that will promote stability prosperity and help us confront common transnational threats such as tracking down terrorists and responding to global health problems like avian flu
1854540 there are elements of chinese behavior which are very troubling mccain has pointed specifically to their military buildup they appear to be gaining for example maritime capabilities that in certain situations could complicate the operating ability of the u s navy they have more than a thousand ballistic missiles pointed at taiwan they are engaged in very large spending across their defense spectrum
1854541 we need to watch with interest and perhaps increasingly with concern its military program
1854542 but we cant assume that that inevitably foreshadows military confrontation with china you could create a self fulfilling prophecy there which would be unnecessary and antithetical to our national security interests
1854543 oh we really do care about human rights we do
1854544 wait a minute we dont even know the administrations stance on china yet how can liberals oppose a view they havent even heard yet
1854545 some of you may remember that in my early days i was a bleeding heart liberal then i became a man and put away childish ways
1854546 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but it is compelling evidence
1854547 the idea that anyone could say they could convict someone with what they have is stunning
1854548 they have nothing there was not a single piece of evidence produced from all those search warrants and all those affidavits he was a weird bookish nerdy kind of man but he didnt do it he was an open caring honest man with a great sense of humor who was beloved by his friends and family
1854549 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
1854550 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1854551 im a little dream self short and stout im the other half of bruce when he lets me out when i get all steamed up i dont pout i push bruce aside then im free to run about
1854552 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
1854553 had mental troubles but he always sought treatment for them he was aware of his mental state and he sought to correct it and took medication for it he never denied it
1854554 i like individual kappas enormously and love being around them i never choose an enemy but theyve been after me since the 1960s and really after me since the late 1970s at one time in my life i knew more about kkg than any non kappa that had ever lived
1854555 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1854556 sis all that matter is he love you and you love him and one thing i know is that yall love each other everything else doesnt matter for yall to be together this long through everything is a bless who give a fuck about what somebody have to say the truth will come to the light just do you and know that i got your back no matter what a man is going to be a man a young man doesnt turn into a man until hes 25 yet and still he doesnt know 100 about all the wrong choice he has made the only thing a woman can do is do what she has to do for herself because a man never ends up with a nothing ass woman unless hes a nothing ass nigga a man know where home is and he will never do anything to fuck that up but if by chance he does hes going to do everything in his power to make things right at home
1854557 thats a bit fucked up maybe you guys are cool with that i dunno
1854558 this is ridiculous they need more people to check us out i cant believe the nerve of this store letting the lines get this bad
1854559 this is totally absurd look at how slow those old people are they should fire those old people and hire someone who can get the job done
1854560 oh my gawd this is the biggest inconvenience i cant believe i have to waste my time like this
1854561 if you want a happy ending that depends of course on where you stop your story
1854562 in the end we are all separate our stories no matter how similar come to a fork and diverge we are drawn to each other because of our similarites but it is our differences we must learn to respect
1854563 it wont be long now before we reach the headquarters
1854564 ill report to the others about what has happened i think that they will take a keen interest in these recent events

1854580 send every general in the field a barrel of it
1854581 our revels now are ended is rounded with a sleep
1854582 my initial reaction was one of amazement acknowledging that young people today face so many more challenges in preparation for adult life and one challenge they dont need is the distraction of gambling and its associated vices
1854583 i do understand that its important for teachers to be creative and engaging with kids certainly with topics that can be potentially dry such as mathematics
1854584 im sure the teacher prevailed upon them to understand the financial metrics of the exercise but i dont think that the kids would have really drawn from that the key take out would be a sanctioning and mainstreaming of gambling habits
1854585 theres certainly a need to connect mathematics to the real world and im assuming that thats what they were trying to do
1854586 part of the reason would be that the students see that by looking at the mathematics of gambling that you usually dont get your money back you end up losing
1854587 i would assume people are exposed to that all the time anyway and the better way of informing kids at school is that the more mathematics that kids know the more they can make better decisions
1854588 mathematics is useful but its also a part of citizenship to understand how things work because you can make better decisions about what to do
1854589 i think teachers do a lot of those sorts of things although im not sure how often they taken them to a racetrack thats probably unusual
1854590 i see investing as being very different to gambling investing is an organised structured and guided process and i see teaching children about that as very different to taking them to race tracks and gambling which is all about profiting form someone elses loss
1854591 i have always been standing in your doorway isnt it about time somebody saved your life
1854592 it is necessary to take into full account the issue of food security in tackling the challenges in energy climate change and other fields
1854593 under the command economy the central bank is the leader while commercial banks are followers but from the current market economy perspective of the central banks functions the bipartite relationship varies on different occasions in terms of monetary policies the central bank as the monetary authority is the policy maker and regulator while commercial banks are market participants and players but in terms of market building the relationship is not simply that of leader and followers but of central bank and commercial banks in a market environment this broad positioning and premise will have a direct bearing on how we behave on the one hand it requires the central bank to work as a service provider a general designer and supervisor of the market on the other hand it requires market participants and various associations to cultivate shibor as stakeholders and players on a leveling playground
1854594 w hen clients complain about high interest rate commercial banks can pass the buck to the central bank because the central bank sets the interest floor when shibor matures shibor will become the culprit such a change bears important legitimacy authoritativeness and persuasiveness and can make shibor a recognized and authoritative benchmark
1854595 the only difference between reality and fiction is fiction has to be credible
1854596 i wanted to take ceramics but ceramics was full so i had to take photography and i failed that class

1854612 i may be kind of crazy but im a christian and i dont believe in doing these things for show
1854613 i dont do it for the publicity i do it because i want to give back baseball saved me

1854615 i want to give other kids the opportunity to experience the same things ive been able to experience its a blessing i never forget where i came from and how important baseball was to me

1854622 for so many of my supporters just like so many of baracks supporters this was a first time investment of heart and soul and money and effort and sleepless nights and miles of travel
1854623 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are once again tied in the latest gallup poll daily obama received a brief increase in support near the conclusion of his overseas trip last week gaining a nine percentage point advantage in july 24 26 polling but that bounce disappeared almost quickly as it emerged
1854624 famous for no reason just a pretty face the ad implies but loitering below is something more nefarious obama dog whistles the ad hitting old racists in the sweet spot could f k these white girls
1854625 ive covered a lot of campaigns and ive never seen anything like this
1854626 presidential election campaigns usually youre working all the time you get to the hotel at two in the morning and youre back on the plane at six but mccain does one event a day one event its unbelievable

1854628 the first analyst who actually dissected the game for viewers
1854629 the timing of minkows surrender was not that surprising considering his already discredited case against usana and to a lesser extend herbalife had taken another battering the past few days
1854630 within days of minkows first anti usana report being published in mid march 2007 three class action law suits were filed on behalf of shareholders based specifically on minkows claim that usana was an illegal pyramid scheme the most prominent allegation of wrong doing among many the suits were eventually consolidated into one and that suit has just been dismissed with prejudice meaning the plaintiff is barred from ever bringing an action again based on the same claim here are some but not all of the issues the court considered and then summarily rejected lack of demand for usana products inevitable market saturation misrepresentation of usanas long term sustainability pyramid scheme

1854638 we had an area scout go see him and then rusty saw him and he was hitting 95 mph and 98 mph
1854639 theres been some off field issues were aware of but hes going to get a second chance
1854640 weve just stepped back from negotiations with davidson and let them hopefully review opportunities in front of them
1854641 but just because his hand feels good doesnt mean hes ready to hit i dont need a body i need an offensive player
1854642 all you have to do is take a look at his numbers
1854643 with the exception of one maybe two starts all season long hes been dominating you talk to guys on the other team that have to face him and all of them are pretty impressed with the way that hes developed not only with his pitches but his maturity and learning how to pitch hes not a thrower
1854644 i felt like this outing wasnt that bad we got the win and that was the biggest part
1854645 but thats just way too many walks for me especially when im talking about trying to be efficient with my pitches those are going to kill you
1854646 its still early weve got a lot of baseball left but at this point hes throwing the ball as well as anybody in the game
1854647 theres no question hes going to get real strong cy young consideration
1854648 lincecums got some of the best stuff in the game if not the best
1854649 hes throwing a changeup that acts as a split its like 88 mph if hes got that going hes tough to hit
1854650 its hard to score in this ballpark and not only that its hard to score with their pitchers so youve got to take advantage of everything you can get
1854651 weve got guys that dont care about situations that happen on or off the field
1854652 the doom and gloom that was in here two days ago and we end up with a 4 2 road trip and again were doing fine
1854653 when you get a team thats a little more experienced youre able to understand the situations confront them and move on
1854654 you can see that maturity with our team thats starting to show
1854655 he had his best velocity since ive been here he walked those two guys in the third inning and they scored but he did throw the ball better
1854656 ricky had great at bats sparked our offense big time
1854657 i was real proud of rickie rickie got hot this time of year last year too even though theres a lot of people that get on him because they really dont look beyond the day to day happenings rickies been swinging the bat very well since the all star break
1854658 it was just out of my reach if i had to do it over again id watch it and let brandon field it
1854659 dont take this the wrong way but i hated your message
1854660 now it will be even better you can watch it with me simply because you love me
1854661 he reiterated that he was tired of taking it and was upset and had info that he had not released
1854662 i did not threaten anybody nor would i ever threaten anybody
1854663 recent events have sparked us to tell about the tim donaghy that america hasnt been introduced to but who we know all too well
1854664 we understand there are some referees who are not happy as a result of tims cooperation with federal investigators but we also expect that there will be more info coming forward in the next several weeks
1854665 were not going to allow someone who is calculating and manipulative to be painted as a victim
1854666 he has a demonstrated pattern of behavior that everyone needs to know
1854667 we dont hire or fire referees we protect our members
1854668 we interviewed him and the people with whom he was in dispute and in that process we determined no basis to terminate him
1854669 but we told him if there was additional conduct of that nature that he would be terminated we continued to investigate him and found nothing to suggest a continuation of that behavior
1854670 does not relate to mr donaghy and was not done in response to his actions its a very demanding management job to oversee a workforce of 60 highly skilled individuals who dont have a home office we needed a full time executive and manager to oversee the program
1854671 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
1854672 if i am elected president i will set this nation on a course to building 45 new reactors by the year 2030 with the ultimate goal of 100 new plants to power the homes and factories and cities of america

1854674 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
1854675 concerns over climate change suggest a larger role for nuclear power as an energy supply choice
1854676 the nuclear power 2010 program is working with industry to demonstrate the nuclear regulatory commission s new streamlined licensing process
1854677 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
1854678 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
1854679 safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste
1854680 those were two of my favorite movies and they were about role reversal

1855235 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
1855236 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
1855237 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
1855238 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
1855239 whilst we welcome this disclosure from the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children

1855252 meski benar ada si pengemis besar si pengemis pertengahan dan si pengemis kecil mereka itu bukanlah murid muridku sekalipun ini si orang she lee dia barulah belajar serupa ilmu silatku yang kasar ia masih bukan muridku yang dapat menjadi ahli warisku bukankah kau memandang enteng ilmu silatku mencuri ayam dan meraba anjing bukankah aku si pengemis bangkotan omong besar apabila aku hendak mengangkat satu murid langsung belum tentu ia seperti kau
1855253 di mulut kau mengatakan begini di dalam hatimu kau mencaci aku
1855254 di dalam hatinya dia memang sedang mencaci kau malah mencaci lebih hebat sekali
1855255 sungguh menyebalkan itulah mirip tulisannya kuasa dari toko penukar uang perak
1855256 jikalau aku sendiri yang melawan kau sampai mampus juga kau tentu tidak puas
1855257 maka sekarang juga hendak aku mengangkat seoarng murid supaya segera dia melawan kau
1855258 saudara ini barusan telah bertempur beberapa puluh jurus denganku jikalau siepe tidak turun tangan sudah tentu keponakanmu yang beruntung memperoleh kedudukan di atas angin
1855259 sekarang hendak aku mengambil kau sebagai murid kau senang atau tidak
1855260 apakah kau tidak mencele aku si pengemis tua apakah enak mendengarnya kau kalau orang katakan gurumu adalah aku si pengemis tua
1855261 sebenarnya teecu sudah mempunyai enam guru maka itu teecu pikir
1855262 seorang kuncu memang tidak melupakan asal usulnya baiklah sekarang aku mengajarkan kau dulu dengan tiga jurus
1855263 baik anak yang baik cukup sudah sekarang kau tolongi aku mengajar adat pada ini bandit cabul
1855264 jikalau hari ini aku tidak memperlihatkan ilmu silat istimewa dari keluargaku pasti sekali sukar untuk aku merebut kemenangan
1855265 semenjak masih kecil aku telah dididik pamanku kenapa aku tidak dapat merobohkan muridnya si pengemis tua ini murid yang baru saja diberi pengajaran tidakkah dengan begitu aku akan meruntuhkan kesohoran dari pamanku di tangannya si pengemis bangkotan ini
1855266 si racun tua setiap hari memelihara ular ini ilmu silatnya kulit ular emas tentulah ia ciptakan dari tubuhnya ular berbisa kau beruntung sekali karena sekarang belum aku si pengemis tua dapat memikir daya untuk memecahkannya nah kau pergilah baik baik
1855267 paman telah pesan wanta wanti padaku kalau bukan menghadapi bencana kematian tidak boleh aku menggunai ini tiou silatnya yang diberi nama kim coa kun kuntauw ular emas sekarang si pengemis tua mengetahuinya apabila pamanku mengetahui juga aku bisa di hukum berat
1855268 baiklah hari ini kau menerima dua murid kau sekarang berat sebelah aku tidak mau mengerti
1855269 maka itu tidak dapat dalam satu hari aku melanggar pula aturan dengan menerima dua murid
1855270 hm baiklah aku terima kau sebagai murid mustahil oey lao shia di bangkotan tersesat nanti gegares tubuhku
1855271 jangan kau menyesali suhu kamu kaum pengemis bagaimana caranya kamu menangkap ular coba suhu mengajari aku
1855272 kedua jeriji tangan mesti merupakan sebagai sepit asal tepat kenanya ular bagaimana beracun juga tidak bakalan bergeming lagi
1855273 ajukan tangan kiri untuk memancing ia menggigit jari tangan kiri kita
1855274 lalu dengan tangan kanan menghajar dia di tempat tujuh dim juga
1855275 tentu saja tangan kiri itu mesti dipakaikan obat supaya toh kalau kena digigit akibatnya tidak membahayakan
1855276 aku ini muridnya ang cit kong sekarang aku ingin belajar kenal dengan ilmu silatnya kulit ular lemas paling dulu hendak aku menjelaskan padamu tanganku ini sudah ditorehkan obat pemunah racun ularmu dari itu kau haruslah waspada
1855277 dengan menempur kau bukannya dengan segebrakan saja dapat aku mencekukmu tidak peduli tanganmu ada apanya yang aneh cukup untukku asal aku tidak membenturnya
1855278 karena aku cuma mau belajar kenal sama kutauw ularmu yang bau busuk itu maka jikalau kau menggunakan kainnya macam ilmu silat kau terhitung kalah
1855279 aku tidak sangka kau telur busuk pandai sekali kau bicara
1855280 kalau aku jambak rambutnya itulah terlebih hebat lagi aku jadi berlaku kasar habis kemana aku mesti menyerang
1855281 sekarang teranglah ilmu silat ularmu yang bau itu tak dapat berbuat apa apa terhadap muridnya ang cit kong
1855282 itu artinya ilmu silat itu tak ada keanehannya selama di istana chao wang kita pun pernah bertempur itu waktu aku malas mengeluarkan tenaga aku kalah karena itu kita sekarang seri mari kita bertempur lagi untuk memastikan menang atau kalah
1855283 ini nona memang lihai tetapi dia tak dapat melawan musuhnya barusan ia menang karena menggunai akal tidakkah itu bagus kenapa dia mau bertempur lagi seperti orang melukiskan ular di tambah kaki
1855284 kau yang kalah atau aku yang menang toh sama saja bukan tapi kalau ada mempunyai kegembiraan baiklah aku yang rendah suka menemani kau main main
1855285 selama di istana pangeran chao wang itu di kiri kananmu semua ialah sahabat sahabatmu andaikata aku menang terang sudah mereka bakal menolongi kau
1855286 dan aku pun ada kawan kawanku memang benar sahabatmu berjumlah lebih banyak tetapi tidak apa aku dapat melayani kerugian di pihakku itu sekarang begini saja mari kita menggurat satu lingkaran bulat siapa yang lebih dulu keluar dari lingkaran dia yang kalah
1855287 cara bun itu ialah aku menyerang kau tiga kali kau tidak boleh membalas
1855288 kau juga menyerang kepadaku dan aku pun tidak boleh membalasi kalau cara bu ialah kita bertarung sesuka kita kau boleh pakai ilmu silat ular mampus atau kuntauw tikus hidup sesukamu asal siapa yang keluar terlebih dahlulu dari lingkaran dialah yang kalah
1855289 kau pilih cara bun kau masih mempunyai harapan baiklah aku memberi keleluasan padamu kita pakai cara bun siapa yang menyerang lebih dulu kau atau aku
1855290 kau memilih belakangan karena kau tahu jikalau kau lebih dulu kau bakal tampak kerugian kau jadi berpura ngalah terhadap aku baiklah hari ini aku yang akan terus bersikap seorang kesatria aku akan mengalah sampai di akhirnya
1855291 dia memang jahat dia bagiannya mampus tetapi kalau dia mampus di tangan muridku jelek di muka pamannya itu
1855292 anak manis hari ini kau telah membikin terang muka gurumu dengan apa aku harus memberi upah kepadamu
1855293 aku memikir untuk mengajari kau satu atau dua tipu silat tetapi dalam beberapa hari ini aku sangat malas bergerak aku tidak mempunyakan kegembiraanku
1855294 aku nanti memasaki kau beberapa macam sayur untuk membangkitkan semangatmu
1855295 kami kaum kay pang ada mempunyai banyak urusan untuk dibicarakan
1855296 ma totiang yang menjadi paman gurmu yang nomor satu pernah mengajarkan ilmu silat dan lain lain paman gurumu seperti khu supee dan ong supee semua memandang tinggi kepadanya sebenarnya kita adalah orang sendiri
1855297 aku khawatir mereka jijik dengan kedekilan kita mereka tidak akan sudi dahar makanan kita kaum pengemis
1855298 lee toako ada cianpwee kami aku justru ingin sekali mempererat persahabatan kita
1855299 tapi ingat jangan kau membujuk murid kepalaku ini menjadi pengemis kau muridku yang kecil pergi kau mengantarkan nona thia pulang kami bangsa pengemis sekarang kami hendak pergi mencuri ayam dan mengemis nasi
1855300 di sini aku bertemu bersama nona oey kita pun bentrok sama auwyang kongcu kerananya perjalananku terlambat
1855301 apakah nona oey akan turut bersama pergi ke pak khia
1855302 mari kita pergi ke rumah abu untuk beristirahat setelah terang tanah kita melanjutkan perjalanan kita
1855303 yang di depan tiga orang yang di belakang yang mengejar belasan
1855304 yang di depan itu semua kuda mongolia yang di belakangnya bukan heran kenapa kuda mongolia dari gurun pasir lari larian di sini
1855305 yong jie kau memainlah dengan burung ini nanti aku menghajar tentara kim itu
1855306 hai bangsat anjing dari mana berani banyak tingkah di sini
1855307 masih kamu tidak mau menyingkir apakah kamu ingin mampus semua di sini
1855308 tiga orang itu melawan kami dengan tamengnya tidak dapat kami memanah mereka
1855309 coba tidak ceng jie datang menolong pastilah kami tak bakal dapat minum pula airnya sungai onom yang jernih
1855310 kami berjanji bersama sama mengerahkan angkatan perang kita guna menggenjet pasukan perang kim adikku bilang mungkin nanti aku ketemu kau maka ia menyuruh aku membawa burung ini
1855311 dalam satu bulan aku mesti memenuhi janji pergi ke pulau tho hoa to mungkin sekali ayahnya yong jie bakal membunuh aku maka itu tiba tiba dapat aku perdulikan lagi dia itu
1855312 sepasang burung ini menjadi kepunyaanku kau boleh ambil buat main
1855313 maka juga adik rajanya sendiri yaitu pangeran yang nomor enam yang memimpin pasukannya memegat kami
1855314 benar dia memakai kopiah emas inilah aku lihat jelas sayang sekali tiga kali aku panah dia saban saban panahku dirintangi tameng pengiring pengiringnya
1855315 yong jie adik kang wanyen lieh ada di sini mari kita lekas cari dia
1855316 kita sudah meninggalkan pangeran dan kabur kalau kita pulang kita ada bagian dipotong kepala kami
1855317 karena itu kami hendak meloloskan seragam kami untuk kabur dan menyembunyikan diri
1855318 anda aku lagi bertugas tidak dapat aku ayal ayalan maka di sini saja kita berpisahan
1855319 kita menanti sampai wanyen lieh datang bersama pasukannya itu waktu tentu kita bakal menemui dia kalau jumlahnya besar sekali kita menguntit saja malamnya baru kita menyatroni untuk membunuh padanya tidakkah itu bagus
1855320 sebenarnya ini tiou daya lumrah saja namanya berpindah dari gili gili menaik perahu
1855321 nanti aku pergi ke dalam rimba untuk menyembunyikan kuda kita
1855322 benar kebanyakan dia masih bersembunyi di dekat dekat sini mari kita cari pula
1855323 dia kwee ceng anaknya kwee siauw thian dari dusun gu kee cun di lim an
1855324 kalau kita keluar sekarang ada kemungkinan kita terlihat mereka tidak nanti mereka menyangka kita berada di sini sebentar setelah mereka pergi jauh barulah kita mengangkat kaki
1855325 pemuda she kwee itu bernama kwee ceng ia gagah sekali
1855326 untuk membalas sakit hati ayahnya ia bakal mencelakai hu ong
1855327 apakah kau pernah pergi ke lim an apakah katanya perdana menteri su itu
1855328 asal aku menggeraki tanganku pasti sudah dapat aku membalas sakit hati ibuku
1855329 tetapi bagaimana dapat aku turun tangan laginya apakah benar aku selamanya tidak sudi menjadi putra raja apakah aku mesti hidup seperti kwee ceng yang mesti merantau saja
1855330 anak kang kita pernah menjadi ayah dan anak maka itu untuk selamanya kau tetap anakku yang aku cintai
1855331 negara kim kita tak usah sampai sepuluh tahun bakal dapat merampas kerajaan song maka itu waktu dengan kekuasaan besar berada di tanganku kebahagiaan kita tidak ada batasnya egara ini yang luas dan indah adalah kepunyaanmu
1855332 dengan ketangguhan kerajaan kim sekarang memang gampang untuk menakluki kerajaan song hu ong pun sangat cerdas dan pandai bekerja sekalipun raja sekarang tidak dapat melawannya kalau usaha hu ong ini berhasil bukankah aku akan menjadi raja di kolong langit ini
1855333 dia tidak bakal lolos tentu dia sembunyi di dalam sana
1855334 pergilah toako bersama nona oey mencarinya ke timur aku akan mencari ke barat
1855335 yo toako mungkin ia sembunyi di barat mari aku turut kau memeriksa ke sana
1855336 wanyen lieh manusia licin di mana kau bersembunyi lekas keluar
1855337 tak usah kau begitu baik hati memberitahukan kedatangan kita kepadanya
1855338 lihat itulah bekasnya orang duduk benar benar ia pernah datang kemari
1855339 jangan takut yong jie si jahanam berada di dalam peti mati
1855340 kau tutup saja peti itu supaya mahkluk di dalamnya tak dapat keluar
1855341 nanti aku coba menyerang dengan pukulan memukul udara tidak peduli dia mayat hidup atau wanyen lieh mari kita dengar jeritan atau tangisannya
1855342 bukankah telur busuk itu auwyang kongcu dari wilayah barat itu
1855343 orang she yo aku beri selamat padamu di belakang hari tak terbatas kebahagiaan dan keagunganmu
1855344 rupanya dia telah mendapat dengar apa yang tadi aku bicarakan dengan hu ong
1855345 tidakkah itu terdengarnya lebih erat kenapa justru kau memanggil hu ong
1855346 mari kita pergi aku tanggung sebentar lagi mereka akan akur pula
1855347 kau tidak mau pergi jangan kau menyesal kalau ada kejenakaan sebentar aku tidak akan membilangimu
1855348 kau mengakui bangsat menjadi ayahmu itulah masih bisa dimengerti sebab di antara kamu ada rasa cinta lama dan kau pun belum dapat berbalik hati tetapi sekarang niatmu tidak benar itulah yang bukan bukan kau hendak membikin musnah negara sendiri ini ini
1855349 kau menyambut yang baru dan membuang yang lama di dalam hatimu sudah ada orang lain maka begitulah kau berlaku terhadap aku
1855350 kau telah ikut auwyang kongcu itu dia pintar surat dan pandai silat dia menangi aku sepuluh kali lipat mana kau melihat mata lagi padaku
1855351 kalau enci bok menyukai telur busuk itu mustahil dia menaruh enci di dalam peti mati ini
1855352 dia kena ditawan dia kehilangan kesucian dirinya mana bisa aku hidup bersama pula dengannya
1855353 kau telah terjatuh di tangan orang untuk banyak hari kau dipeluk dan dirangkul pulang pergi
1855354 adik hendak aku meminjam pisau belati yang baru baru ini aku serahkan padamu
1855355 pisaunya engko ceng ada padaku mana itu kepunyaannya yo toako yang aku berikan pada kau enci inilah jodoh yang sudah ditulis tadi kamu telah berselisih itulah tidak ada artinya jangan kau berbuat duka aku pun sering bercedera dengan ayahku sekarang ini bersama engko ceng aku mau pergi ke pak hia untuk mencari wanyen lieh maka itu enci jikalau kau senang mari kau turut bersama kami pesiar aku percaya yo toako pun bakal turut bersama
1855356 barusan ia berselisih dengan enci dalam gusarnya enci telah menabok dia lantas ia ngeloyor pergi
1855357 aku tidak mau pergi ke pak khia kamu juga tidak usah pergi ke sana
1855358 dalam tempo setengah tahun ini jahanam wanyen liah itu tidak nanti berada di pak khia dia takut nanti kamu pergi mencarinya untuk menuntut balas engko kwee adik oey kamu berdua orang orang baik beruntungan kamu pun bagus
1855359 mustahilkah seorang perempuan yang dirangkul rangkul dan dipeluk peluk hilang kesucian dirinya hingga sekalipun orang yang mencintainya dan menghormatinya pun menjadi tidak memandang mata kepadanya sampai ia tidak diambil peduli lagi
1855360 celaka aku pergi tanpa tujuan kalau yong jie mencari aku mungkin dia tidak dapat menemuinya
1855361 kalau oey yong dikurung ayahnya dan dia tidak dapat menolongi aku bukankah aku bakal mati kelaparan di sini
1855362 kuburan dari phang sie nyonya pemilik dari tho hoa to
1855363 macan tutul atau rase yang bagaimana gesit pun tidak dapat bergerak sepesat ini
1855364 kenapa aku lancang menolongi dia pantas saja ayahnya yong jie gusar kalau nanti dia ini satu iblis bukankah aku jadi melakukan kesalahan besar
1855365 kau muridnya salah satu dari coan cin cit cu yang mana

1855368 oey tocu dari tho hoa to yang menitahkan teecu datang kemari
1855369 ialah guruku yang baik budi ang kiu cie sin kay
1855370 dia masih begini muda umpama kata dia belajar semenjak dalam kandungan dia toh baru belajar delapan atau sembilanbelas tahun maka heran kenapa aku tidak sanggup melawan suara seruling tapi dia sanggup
1855371 ia tak ada celaannya kecuali belum mahir betul heran kenapa ia dapat bertahan dari lagu thian mo bu
1855372 orang tua ini berimbang kepandaiannya dengan ang cit kong dan oey yok su kenapa di thoa hoa to ini orang semacam ini adakah ia see tok atau lam tee
1855373 menurut apa yang teecu dengar orang yang paling gagah sekarang ini cuma ada lima orang coan cin kauwcu ong totiang telah menutup mata kiu cie sin kay yang menjadi guruku dan oey tocu teecu kenal maka itu mungkinkah cianpwee ada auwyang cianpwee atau toan hongya
1855374 bukankah kau merasakan ilmu kepandaianku berimbang sama tong shia dan pak kay
1855375 barusan cianpwee menolak padaku dari itu teecu merasa kalau bukan ang ingsu dan oey tocu belum pernah ada orang ketiganya
1855376 aku bukannya see tok auwyang hong dan bukan juga entah apa hongya maka itu cobalah kau menerka lagi sekali
1855377 pernah teecu bertemu dengan seorang yang namanya berimbang sama pemimpin dari coan cin pay yaitu kiu cian jin tetapi ia cuma menang nama kepandaiannya biasa saja
1855378 sebenarnya pengetahuan teecu masih sangat cetek teecu tidak ingat nama cianpwee
1855379 teecu sudah berlaku tidak hormat harap cianpwee suka memberi maaf
1855380 kau menyebut namaku apakah yang tidak hormat kauwcu dari coan cin pay ong tiong yang ialah kakak seperguruanku dan ma giok serta khu cie kee lainnya mereka semuanya keponakan muridku kau bukannya orang coan cin pay tidak usah kau menyebut nyebut cianpwee kau panggil saja aku pek thong
1855381 teecu adalah sebawahan ma totiang dan khu totiang seharusnya teecu menghormati cianpwee sebagai sucouw ya
1855382 ma giok dan khu cie kee semua tidak memandang aku sebagai yang terlebih tua mereka pun tidak menghormati aku sebagai yang terlebih tua itu
1855383 kuping orang ini ditusuk hingga tuli oleh oey yok su coba kau suruh dia membuka mulutnya
1855384 kau telah datang ke mari jikalau kau tidak mati di belakang hari kau bakal jadi seperti dia ini
1855385 setiap malam oey lao shia menyiksa aku tetapi aku tidak sudi menyerah kalah tadi hampir aku roboh di tangannya jikalau tidak kau datang membantu aku saudara kecil dan mungkin tabiatku suka menang sendiri selama belasan tahun akan runtuh dalam satu malaman mari mari disini ada arak dan barang santapan mari kita mengangkat saudara di belakang hari ada untung kita cicipi bersama ada kesusahan kita tanggung bersama juga ketika dulu hari aku mengangkat saudara sama ong tiong yang ia pun mula mula main tolak tolak bagaimana eh apakah benar benar katu tidak sudi
1855386 bukannya begitu cianpwee sebenarnya tingkatku beda hingga dua tingkat jikalau teecu menerima kehendak cianpwee pasti orang akan tertawa dan mencaci teecu tidak tahu diri dan kalau nanti teecu bertemu sama ma totiang dan khu totiang apakah teecu tak malu juga
1855387 kau tidak sudi mengangkat saudara apakah kau mencela usiaku yang sudah lanjut oh
1855388 kau menuruti karena aku paksa kalau lain hari ada orang menanyakan kau kau bakal timpakan kesalahan padaku aku tahu kau tidak sudi angkat saudara denganku
1855389 kakak begini baik hati bagaimana teecu bisa menampik itu mari kakak marilah kita mengangkat saudara mari kita gunai tanah sebagai gantinya hio
1855390 karena aku tidak bisa keluar aku akan paykui di dalam kurungan ini dan kau di sebelah luar
1855391 teecu ciu pek thong hari ini teecu mengangkat saudara dengan saudara kwee ceng di belakang hari senang atau susah kita sama sama mencicipinya siapa yang kemudian menyalahkan janji biar thian kutuk padanya
1855392 perkara panggilan jangan kau bikin susah umpama kata kau lagi main sandiwara kau memanggil ibu padaku boleh saja nona juga boleh
1855393 kau toh ketahui hal ikhwalnya dulu hari itu tong shia see tok lam tee pak kay dan tiong sin thong berlima mengadu kepandaian di puncah gunung hoa san
1855394 ketika itu akhirnya musim dingin di gunung hoa san itu salju seperti membungkus puncak
1855395 mereka berlima itu mulut berunding tangan mengadu pedang lamanya tujuh hari tujuh malam di akhirnya tong shia see tok lam tee dan pak kay berempat mengakui kakak seperguruanku itu ong tiong yang sebagai orang gagah nomor satu di kolong langit ini taukah kamu mengapa mereka membuat pertemuan di hoa san itu
1855396 kalau beigitu kitab itu adalah kitab celaka dalam dunia kita ini
1855397 kalau tan hian hong tidak mendapatkan itu tentulah ia bisa hidup berbahagia dengan bwee tiauw hong di dalam desa di mana mereka mengumpatkan diri dan oey tocu tidak nanti menghendakinya
1855398 kalau begitu ini kakak tua sudah kegilaan ilmu silat sebenarnya belum pernah aku mendengar lain orang yang seperti dia gilanya
1855399 sampai di bagian orang orang kosen di kolong langit ini hendak merampas kitab kiu im cin keng itu
1855400 benar urusan lantas jadi makin hebat bahkan kauwcu dari coan cin kauw tuan dari tho hoa to ang pangcu dari kay pang dan lainnya ikut campur tangan berlima mereka itu merundingkan ilmu silat dengan perjanjian siapa yang paling lihai ialah yang mendapatkan kitab itu
1855401 persahabatanku dengan ong suko memang erat sekali sebelum ia menjadi imam kita memang sudha bergaul rapat belakangan ia ajarkan aku ilmu silat dia mengatakan aku berlajar ilmu silat berlebihan dan kukuh sekali hingga jadi seperti tolol katanya itulah bukan syaratnya kaum imam karena itu aku tidak menjadi murid coan cin kauw di antara dia katanya sebab terlalu mengutamakan ilmu silat ia jadi mengabaikan agama kalau belajar silat orang mesti sungguh sungguh belajar ilmu to kauw mestilah hati orang tawar jadi kedua ilmu itu bertentangan satu dengan lainnya ma giok yang mewariskan pelajaran agamanya suheng dan khu cie kee yang ilmu silatnya sempurna
1855402 jikalau demikian adanya kenapa ong cinjin dapat menjadi orang suci sejati berbareng lihai juga ilmu silatnya
1855403 itulah disebabkan pada dasarnya suko memang berbakat baik dan ia gampang mempelajari segala macam ilmu dia bukanlah seperti kita yang memerlukan latihan mendalam eh ya tadi ceritaku sampai dimana kenapa kau memegatnya
1855404 sampai di bagian sukomu mendapatkan kitab kiu im cin keng
1855405 benar setelah mendapatkan kitab itu suka tidak memahamkan apa bunyinya dia hanya menyimpan buku itu di dalam kotak yang kotaknya ia tindihkan batu di bekalang kuil aku heran sekali aku telah menanyakan sebab dari perbuatannya itu suka tidak mau memberikan keterangannya ia jawab aku dengan tersenyum saja ketika aku mendesak dia menyuruhku menerka sendiri sekarang cobalah kau yang menerka apakah sebabnya itu
1855406 tentulah itu disebabkan ia khawatir kitab itu ada yang curi
1855407 siapakah yang berani mencuri barangnya kaucu dari coan cin kauw siapa berani berbuat begitu itulah tandanya dia sudah bosan hidup
1855408 hanya tidak dapat ia melakukan itu beberapa kali sudah ia mencoba saban saban gagal karena kesangsiannya ah adikku kau nampaknya tolol mengapa kau dapat membadenya
1855409 aku pikir sukomu itu sudah lihai walaupun ia belajar lebih jauh dia tetap nomor satu
1855410 aku pikir pula dia tentunya pergi ke hoa san bukan untuk mendapatkan nama jago nomor satu hanya semata mata untuk mendapatkan kitab itu dan dia mendapatkan bukan untuk belajar lebih jauh hanya untuk menolong orang orang gagah di kolong langit supaya mereka tak usah terus menerus saling membunuh

1855426 in fact eight months after the rapanos decision came out the corps of engineers revised its written regulations regarding application of the clean water act the revised regulations authorize federal jurisdiction only over streams which have continuous flows for at least three months a year
1855427 n either the corps nor the epa would take any action and indeed told me that they epa didnt care what lynn did to the creek channel
1855428 i was again threatened amp judge winmill refused to grant me immunity
1855429 no where has the notion that the federales said its not our cup o tea ever been substantiated
1855430 this episode is classic obama he was slow to recognize he had a problem he looks alternately recalcitrant and then irresolute as with the surge as be bobs and weaves between his base and political reality and he own voting record but it is really a failure of common sense why not include domestic drilling as a significant part of our energy approach after several weeks someone seems to have explained this to the one you have the feeling that each day will bring a new challenge gambit from the mccain camp whats next jiffy lube tune ups for the entire press corps and the rest of the day will be spent watching obama and his media allies trying to swat away the incoming fire it is what happens when you take a victory lap months before the first votes are cast

1855436 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house they confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1855437 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements
1855438 upon release one of the christians permanently departed the country the others thinking that their ordeal was over went back to their daily lives and work but soon received letters demanding that they leave the country immediately
1855439 the decision to deport them runs contrary to recent attempts to portray the kingdom as a beacon of reconciliation among christians muslims jews and others three weeks ago saudi arabia hosted an interfaith conference in madrid spain during the conference that took place from july 16 19 king abdullah of saudi arabia called for reconciliation among various religions
1855440 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation

1855469 the twelve stores nominated for the 2008 will eisner spirit of comics retailer award was the strongest group of candidates i have seen in my ten years of acting as facilitator of this award

1855513 kota po eng ini bukannya kota melarat miskin kenapa sih orang orang polisi dapat berubha menjadi segala tukang minta minta
1855514 tetapi kemarin ini aku mendengar pembilangnya beberapa pengemis cilik tentang lenyapnya tak berbekas dari beberapa nona cantik manis adri itu timbullah kegembiraan aku si pengemis tua maka aku jadi datang melongok
1855515 sebenarnya beberapa nona itu tidak cantik luar biasa kalau kau menginginkannya dengan memandang mukamu sukalah aku membayarnya pulang
1855516 tuan yang terhormat apakah shemu yang mulia dan namamu yang besar
1855517 rupanya ang cit kong baru mengajari ia ini satu jurus pembela diri

1855519 selagi si pengemis tua nelusup masuk ke dalam kantong aku yang rendah menantikan di bawah lauwteng lantas aku mengundang nona thia terus aku pulang terlebih dahulu untuk menunggui kamu di sini
1855520 nama partai pengemis sangat kesohor sehingga nama itu membuatnya orang tertawa hingga giginya copot apa yang dinamakan ilmu silat mencuri ayam dan meraba raba anjing apa ynag disebut pukulan mengemis nasi dan menangkap ular semua itu telah dikeluarkan dibelakang hari masihkah kau berani usilan urusan kongcu kamu sekarang ini suka aku memberi ampun pada jiwanya ini pengemis bangkotan asal aku dapat meminjam dia punya kedua cahaya terang sebagai tanda mata

1855523 aku hanya hendak membesarkan nyaliku untuk memberi nasehat kepada kau kongcu aku minta sukalah kau memerdekakannya nona thia habis itu lekas lekas kau pulang ke wilayah barat

1855534 dia pun banyak mulutnya aku si pengemis tua dapat aku mencuri dapat aku gegares tetapi aku tidak merampas anak dara orang maka kenapa aku bolehnya tidak sehat bukankah pamanmu tidak sakit dan tidak tumbuhan juga
1855535 bukankah kau menyebut nyebut tentang ilmu silat mencuri ayam dan meraba raba anjing tentang pukulan mengemis nasi dan menangkap ular bukankah kau sangat memandang enteng kepada semua ilmu silat itu
1855536 aku tidak menyangka bahwa dia telah bersembunyi di atas penglari
1855537 kau menyebut dia lo enghiong tetapi dia tidak sanggup melawan kau maka itu kaulah si enghong
1855538 kau mengandalkan ilmu silatnya si racun tua kau datang ke tionggoan ke tenggara ini untuk malang melintang hm hm tapi ketahui olehmu selama si pengemis belum mampus aku khawatir kau tidak akan mendapatkan tempatmu di sini
1855539 siepee bersama pamanku ada sama kesohornya maka itu aku menurut saja segala perintah siepee

1855543 for paul it was no small evil to quench the light of the gospel to bring a mans conscience into bondage and to remove the distinction between the law and gospel

1855866 non ha aperto bocca per dire una parola di preghie ra onde essere risparmiato n una parola di maledizione per i suoi assassini come una pecorella si lasciato condurre al macello per essere ucciso come agnello muto portato davanti a chi lo tosa

1856008 omar will be convicted those military commissions are designed to convict
1856009 theres very little question what the end of the road is for omar khadr if the canadian government doesnt intervene and demand omars release from guantanamo to face due process in a canadian court
1856010 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd
1856011 but convicting someone with unfair rules cant ever be just
1856012 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values
1856013 hamdan is probably guilty and probably a real terrorist but what is unfortunate is that instead of having a real conviction in a real court we have this very dubious process
1856014 while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden
1856015 we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1856016 time is like a handful of sand the tighter you grasp it the faster it runs through your fingers
1856017 just because a day care has a license doesnt mean it offers the educational and nurturing environment that i was looking for
1856018 the star rating system will help parents feel good about all the things not covered by licensing
1856019 research tells us that a childs brain develops most rapidly in the preschool years
1856020 these early life experiences are critical we need to pay attention to the quality of the programs these children are participating in
1856021 you have this baby and youre going to give it to someone to take care of all day
1856022 and you hear about these shaken babies and other stories its scary
1856023 is this the night i make good on your 50 bucks
1856024 i called prudence tonight and wanted to spend some time with her
1856025 youre lucky she still speaks to you you named her prudence
1856026 i bet she appreciates you a lot more than you know but come on with a divorce im sure shes still trying to decide if one of you is the good guy or the bad guy
1856027 most of the dorky kids out there on the block are there because they dont feel comfortable at home ya know mom hates dad but is boinkin the next door neighbor when
1856028 dont know the details and nobody wants to tell us so why should we believe one over the other
1856029 so why dont you wanna be cremated he asked casually leaning back to poke at his food
1856030 when i was kid the neighbors house burnt down and when they brought out the two kids who died in it they looked like charcoal
1856031 i was only about six but i knew then i didnt ever want to be burned it was really icky
1856032 mike joseph you are a mean man yes it was icky
1856033 maybe i think about stuff too much thats what kenny says
1856034 tell prudence tell prudence i said youre the real thing mike joseph
1856035 whadda ya say we go back to my place and you collect on your 50 dollar investment
1856036 the police report said shes at bellevue after your last attack on her sanity
1856037 or she fell madly in love with you every woman does i bet
1856038 man your license plate flagged but i didnt know if it was really you
1856039 the man signaled wildly and the car behind turned off the beacon that mike could almost feel burning his neck
1856040 im just trying to get a feel for this place
1856041 he had placed a personal ad that had been accidentally run as personnel i was fresh out of college and i answered it primarily because it sounded so odd then he explained everything and told me he did need a bookkeeper for his business and so i started to work for him and then we started to date
1856042 he was older so smart well established i think i fell in love with what i thought my life would be like with him does that make sense
1856043 somehow i felt i pushed him to find someone more i dont know
1856044 lydia how was the relationship between your husband and melissa
1856045 warren was distant sometimes when she got as and bs in school warren said she shouldve gotten all as melissa never felt she measured to his expectations
1856046 sometimes i thought melissa was staying with friends to avoid um confrontations with her father or just feeling less than adequate in in his eyes

1856048 there are already state laws in place prohibiting teens age 18 and under from texting or using cell phones while driving we need stiffer penalties for crashes where distracted driving by anyone at any age contributes to accidents especially resulting in injuries or fatalities
1856049 i try not to text while driving but yes i have
1856050 i know its not safe but i dont think it should be illegal theres a safe way to do things
1856051 we determined that ms starks actions while clearly negligent did not rise to the level of recklessness as it has been defined in the existing reckless homicide statute
1856052 she had to be going at a fast pace with her eyes off the road for a long time
1856053 the police officer said she drove completely off the roadway and struck matt with the drivers side of the car
1856054 i drive all over the state and i see a lot of things i dont like
1856055 i dont even keep my phone available when im driving
1856056 gue sudah dengar tapi gue nggak mau komentar soal itu itu bukan hak perogratif gue suka suka mereka lah
1856057 mereka nantikan yang memetik benih yang mereka tabur kalau itu anak gue pasti sudah gue geret geret sekolah
1856058 kalau pindah sekolah sih tidak saya paling milih home schooling soalnya di situ lebih fokus juga tidak berpatok pada kurikulum
1856059 kalau misalkan izin itu bebas tidak seperti di sekolah umum
1856060 paling dari nama nama saya gisella dulu dipanggil gisel rasanya jadi aneh
1856061 aku selalu merasa aneh saat orang bertanya bagaimana kamu sampai kenal orang seperti itu apa kamu ingin menjadi seperti mereka
1856062 hence my concern if a completely bogus claim that environmental protection is raising energy prices can get this much political traction what are the chances of getting serious action against global warming
1856063 in a de centered world all it takes is a few well placed parochial interests to bring a vast global process tumbling down
1856064 when governments have been confronted by breakdowns they have frequently resorted to totalitarian measures to keep order in the face of chaos
1856065 is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral
1856066 permatang pauh by election anwar appointed new parliamentary opposition leader
1856067 given the turmoil in the traditional media industries and the large number of layoffs particularly in the daily newspaper segment
1856068 the consistency in the experiences of the 2007 graduates probably can be treated as good news
1856069 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium
1856070 only now is a picture emerging of what may have happened it destroys the pjs theory that the couple accidentally killed madeleine and then tried to dispose of her body
1856071 the met police were tipped by an anonymous source the files showed
1856072 life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like
1856073 you must not lose faith in humanity humanity is an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty the ocean does not become dirty
1856074 all of a sudden the impossible seems possible virtually every area in your personal and professional life can be expanded and explored whatever you dreamed of accomplishing can be realized with the assistance of a service dog
1856075 if youre an incompetent person trying yourself working for everyone
1856076 okay here we go again tall pretty skinny host i hate her already

1856084 dedizione verso attivit pi o meno piacevoli che risultino tuttavia impegnative quindi infiacchenti
1856085 dan zijn onze vrijwilligers nog sneller in de kazerne als we moeten uitrukken
1856086 voor onze vrijwilligers is dat een erezaak als de woningen er zijn zullen we de uitruksnelheden halen van een beroepskorps en dat voor de prijs van een vrijwilligerskorps een koopje
1856087 eerst bouwen we de kazerne daarna volgen de woningen een vijftal jaar later al is dat lang niet zeker
1856088 verschillende vrijwilligers wonen rond de huidige kazerne dat laat ons toe van snel te opereren dat principe willen we nu kopi ren naar de nieuwe kazerne
1856089 voor de twaalf plaatsen heb ik nu al zeventien kandidaten de woningen zullen comfortabel zijn en te huur aan redelijke prijzen er komt een groen scherm tussen de n16 en de woningen ook is er aan de kant van de n16 de noordkant een blinde muur voorzien het gaat om n gebouw met twaalf appartementen voor zowel singles als gezinnen er komt een gemeenschappelijk tuin goed afgescheiden van het terrein rond de kazerne zodat de kinderen er veilig kunnen spelen dat het centrum van kalfort met de gemeenteschool en ook de nieuwe technische school van sjabi vlakbij gelegen zijn maakt het voor gezinnen nog aantrekkelijker
1856090 de samenhorigheid in ons korps is heel groot ik ben daar nogal gerust in
1856091 we kijken vooral uit naar de nieuwe kazerne over de woningen wordt eigenlijk niet veel gesproken de huurprijs zal een belangrijke rol spelen ook zal niet elk meiske er willen wonen maar als er niet genoeg kandidaten zijn kunnen ze er altijd sociale woningen van maken
1856092 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards
1856093 men wil doen uitschijnen dat mijn cli nt jaloers was omdat nathalie een paaldanseres was
1856094 terwijl dat hem helemaal niet kon schelen hij lachte er zelfs mee
1856095 dat was iets wat zij graag deed en waar ze geld mee verdiende
1856096 ze werkte als mannequin danste in de illusion en in de limburgse club exhibit ze blijven van mijn lijf suste ze ons al van toen ze klein was en de eerste keer deelnam aan de soundmix show was ze verknocht aan het podium we hebben haar dat zeker nooit opgedrongen
1856097 wat als wij hem tegenkomen in de stad dat is toch onmenselijk dat dit vlak voor de feestdagen gebeurt maakt het voor ons nog moeilijker wat moeten wij straks denken als we hier met kerstmis rond de tafel zitten zonder nathalie en hij met zijn familie is verenigd
1856098 een kaakslag hij krijgt zelfs geen enkelband om is het normaal dat wij als ouders van een vermoord kind de man die de trekker heeft overgehaald kunnen tegenkomen in de stad wij zouden ons uit de voeten moeten maken om geen ongelukken te begaan hoe moeten wij onze emoties anders te baas kunnen op zon moment
1856099 ik herbeleef nog elke dag hoe ze me die ochtend om 10 uur kwamen vertellen dat nathalie was doodgeschoten
1856100 je staat er mee op en je gaat er mee slapen
1856101 normaal doen of plezier maken dat kunnen wij niet meer
1856102 dan voel ik me direct schuldig ik houd me altijd in gewoon doen gaat niet meer je voelt je als iemand die met zijn laatste krachten probeert naar de kant te zwemmen elke keer als je boven water komt hap je naar adem maar na een tijdje word je moe en wordt het moeilijker en moeilijker om boven te komen ik blijf naar adem happen omdat ik in het psychiatrisch centrum waar ik werk dagelijks mensen zie die er niet meer bovenop geraken vreemd genoeg geeft dat me de kracht om te overleven maar op een dag als deze weet ik het ook niet meer
1856103 het pand staat hier al minstens veertien jaar te verkrotten
1856104 en het zit er vol met ratten dat is het ergste onlangs stond ik nog in mijn waskelder en liep er een rat vlak naast mijn hoofd het gebeurt regelmatig dat we ratten zien het uitzicht vlak naast onze ingang is natuurlijk ook geen cadeau hoog tijd dat er iets wordt aan gedaan
1856105 plots werden we op het fietspad de weg versperd door de politiecombi zodat we in de remmen moesten levensgevaarlijk bovendien gedroegen de twee inspecteurs zich bijzonder arrogant wij hebben niets verkeerd gedaan daarom laten we dat niet over onze kant gaan en hebben we klacht ingediend bij het comit p
1856106 toen ik hen hun gevaarlijk gedrag wees lachten ze mijn protest weg de agenten beweerden dat we een rood licht hadden genegeerd en ook niet op tijd op het fietspad gingen rijden dat ontkennen we ten stelligste meer nog ze behandelden ons echt op een botte manier ze vroegen me mijn identiteitskaart als ze er mee klaar waren smeten ze de kaart terug in mijn richting ze vroegen me mijn adres toen ik zegde dat die op mijn identiteitskaart stond ik was vergeten dat dit met de nieuwe identiteitskaart niet meer het geval is antwoordde de agent niet met mijn voeten spelen eh als ik opperde dat we het koud kregen zegde hij als je kou hebt moet je maar met de auto rijden die uitdagende manieren die uitdagende houding dat stoort me dat arrogante gedoe moet maar eens gedaan zijn stond ik niet recht in mijn schoenen dan zou ik zo niet reageren
1856107 de twee fietsers staken de combi van de inspecteurs rechts voorbij reden niet op het fietspad en reden door het rode licht bovendien gedroegen de twee zich arrogant tegenover onze inspecteurs
1856108 binnen enkele dagen zal worden beslist of we de klacht zelf behandelen ze doorspelen aan het intern toezich van de mechelse politie of ze seponeren
1856109 ik heb alle vertrouwen in het feit dat het comit p de klacht op een grondige manier zal behandelen
1856110 ik werd wakker door flikkerende lichten op het plafond van mijn slaapkamer en hoorde wat lawaai
1856111 ik dacht dat het een auto was die zich keerde niet ongewoon omwille van de uitgaansbuurt hier vlakbij omdat het bleef duren ging ik een kijkje nemen ik schrok hevig als ik de brand zag de vlammen schoten al uit de ene auto de auto ernaast brandde ook al de brandweer was snel ter plaatse ik ben beneden gaan kijken de hitte was enorm onze venster op de eerste verdieping is trouwens gesprongen van de hitte de twee autos naast de auto die is afgebrand zijn zwaar beschadigd een auto aan de overkant van de straat was dat bijna ook maar de brandweer heeft hem meteen afgekoeld dit gaat toch wel erg ver voor een halloweengrap
1856112 ik hoop dat het geen brandstichting was maar een kortsluiting wat moet een mens anders denken
1856113 ik heb geen vijanden waar ik weet van heb ik hoop dat het onderzoek snel duidelijkheid brengt blijkbaar zijn er een jaar geleden in de capucijnenstraat ook twee wagens in brand gestoken toen hebben ze de daders gepakt hopelijk lukt dat als er vandalen mee gemoeid zijn nu ook ik de audi de wagen kostte me 50 000 euro pas sinds april
1856114 mul i c l tori tr iau doar pentru moment neg ndindu se la ce li se va nt mpla m ine
1856115 allemaal omdat we ons hebben verdedigd tegen een vijftien man sterke bende die ons heeft aangevallen
1856116 als mijn broer mij niet had verdedigd dan lag ik nu in het ziekenhuis met een steekwonde als ik het al had overleefd dat is toch wettige zelfverdediging
1856117 de ruzie is ontstaan omdat ik een klant een opmerking maakte over zijn kledij
1856118 de jongen kwam hier binnen met een trainingsbroek sportschoenen en een brede openhangende vest en ik vond dat ongepast in sommige restaurants en bars word je dan meteen geweigerd hier niet we hebben die jongen en zijn vriendin gevraagd om van het restaurantgedeelte te verhuizen naar de lounge toen hij langs me liep maakte ik mijn opmerking de jongen reageerde agressief en zegde is dit niet goed genoeg kus mijn kloten ik ben weg ik geloofde mijn oren niet maar trok het me verder weinig aan
1856119 mijn broer jeto ging meteen naar buiten en ik ging hem achterna we vroegen aan de bende om iets verder richting ijzerenleen met ons te praten net op het moment dat er een auto passeerde kreeg ik een stamp tegen mijn hoofd
1856120 als die jongen niet in het ziekenhuis lag dan lag mijn broer daar nu
1856121 we vinden het heel erg dat er iemand gewond is geraakt
1856122 ik ben een belg van marokkaanse origine ik vind het erg dat mensen van mijn eigen gemeenschap een criminele kern van 15 tot 20 jarigen het zo verbrodden voor de hele gemeenschap dit is een spijtig incident dat wij niet hebben gewild wij willen bloeiende zaak opbouwen iedereen is hier welkom we vragen alleen een beetje respect
1856123 and in that time i have heard something like 3 000 sermons but for the life of me i cant remember a single one of them so i think im wasting my time and the pastors are wasting theirs by giving sermons at all
1856124 ive been married for 30 years now in that time my wife has cooked some 32 000 meals but for the life of me i cannot recall the entire menu for a single one of those meals but i do know this they all nourished me and gave me the strength i needed to do my work if my wife had not given me these meals i would be physically dead today likewise if i had not gone to church for nourishment i would be spiritually dead today
1856125 right now i feel like were going on the right pace
1856126 geez talk bout moving fast haha but at that time in my dream i was in love but like i said more of a dream was coming up see there was this guy that came up to me and karol yesterday a little short mexican man and he was in my dream ill continue later
1856127 umm these guys must be really bored to be actually following us and ditching their other friend
1856128 here take these and whatever ills you will go away
1856129 teclado es el reflejo de lo que hay en tu nariz y en tus intestinos

1856131 hard core illegal drugs is going down for many reasons including price and the government crackdown on supply chains
1856132 i am good christian do not sell my drugs do not do anything to harm anybody are good starting statements but the abuse of my compassion is as high as making them you will be under constant watch and in time with you help mostly your true intentions will be reveled

1856134 tidak pernah dilakukan oleh as salafus sholeh padahal dorongan untuk diadakannya perayaan ini sudah ada dan tidak ada penghalangnya sehingga seandainya perayaan ini sebuah kebaikan yang murni atau lebih besar niscaya as salaf ulama terdahulu semoga allah meridloi mereka akan lebih giat dalam melaksanakannya daripada kita sebab mereka lebih dari kita dalam mencintai rosulullah dan mengagungkannya dan mereka lebih bersemangat dalam mendapatkan kebaikan dan sesungguhnya kesempurnaan rasa cinta dan pengagungan kepada beliau terletak pada sikap mengikuti dan mentaati perintahnya dan menghidupkan sunnah sunnahnya baik yang lahir ataupun batin serta menyebarkan ajarannya dan berjuang dalam merealisasikan hal itu dengan hati tangan dan lisan sungguh inilah jalannya para ulama terdahulu dari kalangan kaum muhajirin dan anshor yang selalu mengikuti mereka dalam kebaikan
1856135 adapun berwasiat untuk perayaan al maulid as syariif maka al fakihany telah menyebutkan bahwa perayaan maulid adalah makruh hukumnya
1856136 fathu al aly al malik fi al fatawa ala mazhab al imam malik
1856137 kalau allah menyembuhkan sapiku maka wajib atasku untuk menyembelih anak yang di dalam perutnya ketika acara maulid rosulillah
1856138 alhamdulillah dan sholawat dan salam semoga terlimpahkan kepada sayidina muhammad rosulillah dia tidak berkewajiban apa apa karena perayaan maulid rosulillah ungkapkan pengarang kitab
1856139 terhadap sebuah pertanyaan yang ditujukan kepadanya tentang seseorang yang mewakafkan sebatang pohon untuk malam maulid kemudian orang tersebut meninggal lalu anaknya ingin mengambil pohon tersebut
1856140 cara cara mereka pada saat ini telah mencemari agama karena kebiasaan mereka dalam perkumpulan tersebut hanya menyanyi dan bersorak sorai mereka telah mempengaruhi orang oramg awam kaum muslimin bahwa hal yang demikian adalah ibadah yang sangat agung untuk dilakukan pada waktu tersebut dan merupakan jalan para wali allah sedangkan kenyataan mereka adalah kaum yang bodoh yang mana diantara mereka banyak yang tidak mengetahui hukum hukum yang diwajibkan kepadanya dalam sehari hari sebenarnya mereka adalah para pesuruh setan untuk menyesatkan orang awam kaum muslimin dengan menghiasi kebatilan kepada mereka mereka telah memasukan kedalam agama allah sesuatu yang tidak termasuk kedalamnya karena bernyanyi dan bersorak sorai adalah termasuk dalam senda gurau dan main main mereka menganggap hal yang demikian adalah perbuatan para wali allah ini adalah suatu kebohongan dibuat di atas nama mereka sebagai salah satu jalan bagi mereka untuk memakan harta manusia dengan cara haram karena itu kebiasaan mereka adalah menyendiri supaya mereka bebas melakukan hal hal yang dilarang maka apa yang diwakafkan untuk hal tersebut hukumnya batil karena tidak menurut cara yang benar disyariatkan oleh agama maka dianjurkan bagi orang yang berwakaf tadi untuk mengalihkan wakafnya kepada hal lain yang dianjurkan dalam syariat kalau seandainya ia tidak mampu maka hendaklah ia ambil untuk dirinya sendiri semoga allah menuntun kita selalu untuk mengikut sunnah nabinya muhammad dan mengikuti para salaf sholih karena keselamatan terdapat dalam langkah mereka
1856141 sang imam muhammad bin abdul wahab melarang kebiasaan orang orang di negri tersebut dan daerah lainnya dari membesarkan hari maulid dan hari hari besar jahiliyah lainnya yang tidak ada dalil yang memerintahkan untuk membesarkannya dan tidak pula keterangan dan hujah syariyah karena hal yang demikian adalah menyerupai umat nasroni kristen yang sesat dalam hari besar mereka baik secara waktu maupun tempat ini adalah kebatilan yang ditolak dalam syariat penghulu segala rasul agama islam di kutib dari
1856142 dan apa yang dilakuakn pada tanggal 27 rajab mengkhususkannya dengan berpuasa dan berkoban pada hari tersebut kemudian amalan malam nisfu syaban seperti itu juga apakah hal tersebut haram dilakukan atau makruh atau mubah boleh
1856143 barang siapa yang menambah nambah dalam urusan kami ini agama ini sesuatu yang tidak termasuk kedalamnya maka hal tersebut adalah ditolak
1856144 hati hatilah kalian terhadap sesuatu hal yang baru dalam agama ini sesungguhnya segala hal yang baru dalam agama adalah bidah dan setiap bidah itu adalah sesat
1856145 barang siapa yang melakukan suatu amalan ibadah yang tidak ada contoh dari kami maka amalan tersebut ditolak
1856146 apakah mereka itu memiliki tandingan tandingan yang membuat syariat agama bagi mereka yang tidak pernah diizinkan allah
1856147 perbuatan maulid adalah perbuatan bidah mungkar dan jelek mengeluarkan harta untuk perbuatan tersebut adalah bidah yang diharamkan dan orang yang melakukannya adalah berdosa maka wajib dicegah orang yang melakukannya
1856148 adapun yang pertama yaitu mewasiatkan sepertiga harta untuk pelaksanaan maulid sebagaimana yang banyak dilakukan manusia ini adalah bidah yang diada adakan setiap bidah itu adalah sesat bersepakat untuk melakukan bidah tidak boleh dan wasiatnya tidak dilakukan bahkan diwajibkan kepada qodhi untuk membatalkannya dan mengembalikan sepertiga harta tersebut kepada ahli waris supaya mereka bagi sesama mereka semoga allah menjauhkan para kaum fakir dari menuntut supaya dilaksanakannya wasiat seperti ini
1856149 tidak boleh mengkhususkan bulan ini rabiul awal dengan berbagai macam ibadah seperti sholat zikir sedekah dll
1856150 sekalipun tidak terdapat dalam pelaksanaan maulid tersebut nyanyi nyanyian cukup sekedar acara makan bersama saja dengan maksud melaksanaka maulid bersamaan dengan itu mengajak teman teman maka hal tersebut tetap merupakan bidah walaupun hanya sebatas niat saja karena hal tersebut adalah menambah nambah dalam urusan agama yang tidak pernah dilakukan oleh para ulama salaf yang silam mengikuti salaf adalah lebih utama dan wajib dari pada menambah niat yang melanggar terhadap apa yang mereka lakukan mereka adalah manusia yang sangat bersungguh sungguh dalam mengikuti sunnah rasulullah saw dan lebih cinta kepadanya dan kepada sunnahnya kalau hal tersebut benar tentulah mereka orang yang pertama sekali melakukannya tetapi tidak seorang pun dari mereka yang melakukannya kita hanya mengikuti mereka kita telah mengetahui bahwa mengikut mereka dalam segala sumber dan keputusan
1856151 sebagian penyair telah menceritakan keadaan zaman kita ini dalam syair mereka orang orang yang mencegah bagi segala perbuatan yang mungkar
1856152 jika ada yang bertanya dari mana kalian mengetahui bahwa rasulullah tidak melakukannya tidak ditemukannya dalil tidak mesti perbuatan tersebut tidak ada
1856153 memberi makan orang yang lapar dianjurkan dalam setiap waktu apa lagi bergembira atas munculnya cahaya kenabian pada bulan yang mulia ini tapi tidak kita temukan seorang pun dari generasi salaf para ulama yang terdahulu yang melakukan hal demikian sekali pun sekedar memberi makan orang yang kelaparan
1856154 melakukan maulid tidak pernah dilakukan oleh generasi islam pertama dari salafus sholih sedangkan mereka adalah orang yang jauh lebih menghormati dan mencintai nabi saw yang mana kecintaan dan penghormatan salah seorang diantara mereka terhadap nabi saw tidak terjangkau oleh kita sekarang ini walau hanya secuil
1856155 dalil yang menunjukkan bahwa orang orang salaf generasi islam yang pertama tidak pernah membedakan antara malam maulid dengan malam malam yang lainnya yaitu perbedaan mereka dalam menentukan malam tersebut sebagian berpendapat pada bulan ramadhan dan sebagian yang lain berpendapat pada bulan rabiul awal kemudian mereka berbeda pendapat lagi tentang tanggalnya dalam empat pendapat kalau seandainya mereka melakukan ibadah tertentu pada hari lahirnya nabi muhammad saw tentu hari tersebut diketahui secara masyhur dan tidak akan terjadi perbedaan pendapat tentang hari tersebut
1856156 yang sangat mengherankan kenapa mereka bergembiraria untuk kelahiran nabi saw
1856157 hitam kelam pandangan ku kalau kita perhatikan apa yang dilakukan oleh kebanyakan orang pada bulan tersebut rabiul awal jusru mereka bergebiraria dan berjoget joget bukanya menangis dan bersedih kalau ini yang mereka lakukan akan lebih tepat dengan suasananya supaya terhapus dosa dosa mereka karena bersedih dan menangis atas kepergian nabi muhammad saw akan menghilangkan dosa dosa dan menghapus bekas bekasnya sedangkan kalau seandainya mereka lakukan ini secara rutinitas juga merupakan bidah sekalipun bersedih atas kepergian nabi saw wajib bagi setiap muslim tetapi bukanlah dengan cara berkumpul untuk melakukan hal yang demikian sekalipun meneteskan air mata itu lebih baik tapi kalau tidak mungkin cukup dengan bersedih hati saja yang melatar belakangi pendapat ini adalah karena mereka melakukan kegembiraan yang membuat jiwa mereka terlena dengan bersenda gurau jogetan gendrang dan seruling berbeda dengan menangis dan bersedih yang bisa membuat jiwa mereka tersendu dan menahan diri dari berbagai macam syahawat dan kesenangannya jika ada yang berpendapat saya melakukan malid karena merasa bahagia dan gembira atas kelahiran nabi muhammmad saw kemudian pada hari yang lain saya khususkan untuk upacara kesedihan atas kematiannya jawabannya adalah telah kita sebutkan di atas seseorang yang mengadakan jamuan makan saja dengan niat maulid dan mengajak teman temannya maka hal ini dianggap bidah yaitu suatu pebuatan yang secara lahirnya kebaikan dan ketakwaan maka bagaimana lagi dengan orang yang mengumpulkan berbagai macam bidah dalam sekaligus terlebih lagi yang melakukannya dua kali sekali untuk bergembira dan kali yang lain untuk bersedih maka semakin bertambah dengannya bidah dan semakin banyak ia mendapat celaan dalam agama wallahu alam
1856158 sesungguhnya bulan kelahiran nabi muhammad saw bertepatan dengan bulan kematiannya maka tidak lah bergembira lebih utama dari pada bersedih pada bulan tersebut

1856187 2007 was not the year of mobile marketing that it was advertised to be
1856188 the vast majority of the spending will be based on text messaging campaigns
1856189 with mobile display advertising and mobile search constituting the rest of the main market
1856190 a basic problem facing mobile marketing and advertising is that while the business proposition cuts across many industries telecom technology media marketing retail it affects the economics of each industry differently
1856191 all parties agree that better targeting will happen given the personal nature of mobile phones but the question of how to use customer information to improve ad targeting while respecting privacy remains elusive
1856192 its not lost on mobile users that they still pay for almost everything on mobile
1856193 dit is het eerste onderzoek dat wij op de mobiele telefoon hebben laten uitvoeren
1856194 er zijn wel eerder onderzoeken gedaan naar mobiel internet maar deze zijn nooit op de mobiele telefoon zelf uitgevoerd opvallend is de hoge respons bijna 400 respondenten hebben de vragenlijst ingevuld op de in totaal twaalf vragen die de respondenten op hun mobiel hebben beantwoord dit toont aan dat mobiel internet een interactief medium optima forma is
1856195 reclame op de mobiel is innovatief daarnaast heeft het een hoge attentiewaarde en daarmee een hoge herkenning dat ook de waardering hoog is mits de boodschap relevant maakt het mobiele internet nog interessanter voor adverteerders
1856196 mobiel internet is een markt die nog te vaak wordt onderschat met name de jonge en mannelijke gebruikers lijken de nieuwe technologie mobiel internet massaal te omarmen ik voorzie dat steeds meer mensen van dergelijke technologie gebruik gaan maken mede door de komst van de iphone het groeiende aantal mobiele internetsites en de aantrekkelijke aanbiedingen van de telecomproviders wellicht dat dit onderzoek adverteerders kan attenderen op de voordelen van deze innovatieve manier van adverteren

1856256 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
1856257 if im asked for my views as a theologian rather than a church leader i have to be honest and admit that they are as ive said
1856258 ive been watching them for the last couple of years and i think it is a very promising club with a lot of talented young players coming through
1856259 i want to be part of something great at the club and i will do everything i can to help souths be a success
1856260 this is a fantastic signing for the club and were sure rhys will be part of a team and working in an environment in which he can fire
1856261 he has a phenomenal tryscoring strike rate hes a great team player and were sure he will do a wonderful job for us at fullback
1856262 hes an enthusiastic player and i think he will fit in perfectly with the young backs weve got already
1856263 our recruitment has targeted some experienced outside backs and he will do the job for us along with colin best next year
1856264 rhys has been a wonderful ambassador for the panthers he has spoken to me on a number of occasions concerning this release and it is in the best interests of both parties

1856278 we pick and choose which bits of scriptures to believe p 238
1856279 we pick and choose among the scriptures for the nice bits and reject the nasty p 243
1856280 by what criterion do you decide which passages are symbolic which literal p 247
1856281 we do not as a matter of fact derive our morals from scripture p 243
1856282 those who wish to base their morality literally on the bible have either not read it or not understood it p 237
1856283 all i am establishing is that modern morality wherever else it comes from does not come from the bible apologists cannot get away with claiming that religion provides them with some sort of inside track to defining what is good and what is bad a privileged source unavailable to atheists p 246 247
1856284 if god wanted to forgive our sins why not just forgive them p 253
1856285 individual atheists may do evil things but they dont do evil things in the name of atheism p 278
1856286 religious wars really are fought in the name of religion and they have been horribly frequent in history i cannot think of any war that has been fought in the name of atheism p 278
1856287 why would anyone go to war for the sake of an absence of belief p 278
1856288 what matters is not whether hitler and stalin were atheists p 273
1856289 i am so saddened by the loss of my dear friend murray vincent he was one of the first faculty to welcome me to public health more than seventeen years ago with a firm handshake and a wide grin and a visit to my new office
1856290 even in retirement he stayed involved with new faculty in the school and made frequent visits to say hello and inquire about how well they were doing
1856291 he remained passionate about sex education issues and continued to influence thinking on the topic with letters to the editor and in other venues i first met him in 1963 when we were grad students together at peter and christine i had many enjoyable hours talking with even debating on a variety of issues over the years we played church league basketball and softball together played a lot of golf and ran our first marathon together in 1969
1856292 we had a lady on the custodial staff who was making a pathetic salary
1856293 thats a remarkable example of caring most people just would never think of it
1856294 it is a truth universally acknowledged that barack obama must continue to grovel to hillary clintons dead enders some of whom mutter darkly that they will not only not vote for him they will never vote for a man again
1856295 yeah tell em they can shove their vr 1 disciplinary report essentially up their
1856296 oh what really huh well i had a ton of em
1856297 you know you have to bring a medical excuse back before you can come back right
1856298 yeah well the thing is i guess im not coming back
1856299 okay really umm yeah thats super way to cripple a prison dude thats just jesuschrist
1856300 peyton remember back when i said how valuable you were to the prison and how if the warden couldnt see the advantage in not fucking over a responsible talented sergeant with a clean record then he was a complete jackass
1856301 he had too many vr 1s to even count thinks its funny to screw up an entire shift at a maximum security prison and cant be bothered to do the job he trained for less than a year ago and they want to rehire him
1856302 yes and he was one of their best recruits dont look at me for an explanation
1856303 daddys job keeps everyone safe both us and the people whove done bad things

1856329 they were reportedly working as per instructions given by an ltte operative in london they told us the materials were samples and that they were supposed to hand them over to some other agency the agency was asked to test the materials in a lab to ensure the quality and then order it in bulk

1856341 there are places where there are no markers at least not easily found
1856342 theres no line painted in the sand or anything like that
1856343 were working with the mexican government to make sure that this doesnt happen again this cant be happening
1856344 it seems that there are dissimilar versions of what happened and both countries are trying to clarify it together
1856345 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along the non demarcated areas of our border
1856346 its a minor miracle that none of our agents have been killed or seriously injured
1856347 vacating settlements which were previously approved for these families has rubbed raw the wounds of september 11 it has caused severe upset disappointment and for some anger
1856348 moral reasons of corporate responsibility and a desire that u s taxpayers not be required to pay for my familys loss
1856349 my attorneys fees were agreed at 25 percent were earned at 25 percent and i request that your honor please pay these attorneys fees at 25 percent of my recovery
1856350 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1856351 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them

1856356 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
1856357 he said well they told my family that i was a murderer
1856358 what he said was my therapist is revealing all my private conversations to the fbi
1856359 somewhat prone to hyperbole when you talked with him youd have to sift through what he was saying to get to the truth of it
1856360 one glass of wine and it would make him really goofy

1856379 we stand by the facts as alleged in the criminal complaint filed in court
1856380 in addition suggestions that siddiqui has been in u s custody for five years are not accurate she was detained on july 17 2008 as alleged in the criminal complaint
1856381 obviously she was arrested in 2003 but we dont know at what stage she was handed over to the americans
1856382 it is a little ironic that while the government is trying to prove the military commissions process is legitimate in the hamdan trial that the next person they arrest immediately goes into the federal court system
1856383 in some ways using a criminal approach has become easier

1856385 16 i did 2 x 2 and then 4 squared and then i thought
1856386 we are working to provide them with the additional forces they would like there is a concerted effort by this building to figure out what more can be done and as the secretary said he would like it done sooner rather than later
1856387 at some point soon hes going to make a recommendation to the secretary and to the president on the possibility of further troop drawdowns
1856388 i know much has been made of sort of the correlation between forces coming down in iraq and going up in afghanistan
1856389 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
1856390 we have first commitments across the globe and threats and contingencies we need to be situated for beyond just the wars in iraq and afghanistan
1856391 our understanding of the science of cyber electronics is relatively immature at this point
1856392 it includes the study of both the physical and the virtual
1856393 theres been some tremendous things going on especially in iraq and afghanistan where electronic warfare has helped in the operations and in limiting and reducing the deaths in theater
1856394 cyber electronics could include or have distinct relationships between things that we call network operations network warfare computer network operations space superiority electronic warfare and the electromagnetic spectrum operations
1856395 each represents a different slice of the cyber electronic continuum within which different capabilities must exist
1856396 there is no nation state border where were talking now
1856397 there are nation state sponsors and we have to look at it in terms of nation state sponsors as well as those who are not nation state sponsors i might call them cyber state sponsors who are really developing on their own out there

1856432 and by taking more time and seeing how the economy now at least here in las vegas has not fallen off the cliff as some people have suggested well be in far better position
1856433 you can take a look at us and our competitors
1856434 were still making money although not as much as we have in the past
1856435 this being the 10th year nothing has changed in that there is no support from so many angles such as the kenyan government the american government
1856436 we blame them the us for the bombing without their embassy being here in kenya we would not have been bombed
1856437 many have died from the injuries many have died because they dont have medical support many have died because they cannot meet their obligations
1856438 it is sad but telling that the presidential campaign of republican sen john mccain has already slipped into the gutter before the nominating convention has even been held it would be even sadder considering the nations desperate desire and need for a change in political leadership and policy if american voters fall for the inane irrelevant mean spirited and flatly false commercials now attacking democratic candidate sen barack obama
1856439 all mccain has left is to strike at obamas image
1856440 while the midsummer timing may seem early in the election season to launch attack ads theyre indicative of mccains predicament being on the wrong side of popular opinion on just about every major issue in the campaign all mccain has left is to strike at obamas image and you can expect the attack ads to keep rolling out all summer long
1856441 of course there are risks for mccain in how he goes after obama with some republicans and old advisers second guessing the tone and content of his attacks and worrying out loud about whether mccain is putting his vaunted personal image and nonpartisan appeal at risk by sounding negative on the stump
1856442 john mccains campaign so far is a disappointment once upon a time he seemed didnt he like a guy who would resist turning to the slash and burn tactics associated with the likes of karl rove he talked about wanting a respectful campaign he invited his opponent to share the stage with him at multiple events he trashed certain kinds of charges made against sen obama such as those made by ohio talk show host bill cunningham and columbus based preacher activist rod parsley but look at whats happening now
1856443 its awfully early for john mccain to be running such a desperate ugly campaign against barack obama negative campaigning is not a pretty thing and it should be beneath john mccain to stoop so low
1856444 by featuring paris hilton and britney spears in an attack ad against barack obama the senator from arizona has risked charges of silliness to draw attention to his frequently overshadowed campaign even some mccain allies have winced at the paris britney spot
1856445 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
1856446 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter sen john mccain has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama by raising questions about his patriotism instead of taking the democrat down a few notches these baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
1856447 has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
1856448 the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook mr mccain used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics which killed his own 2000 presidential bid but he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day to day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of mr rove and gave top positions to two others
1856449 but lumping obama with spears and hilton two celebrities who have not exactly comported themselves in public in a mother teresa like manner seems like a dubious comparison rates thisad 0 in truthfulness on a scale from 0 misleading to 10 truthful
1856450 the attacks are part of a newly aggressive mccain operation
1856451 the attacks are part of a newly aggressive mccain operation whose aim is to portray the democratic presidential candidate as a craven politician more interested in his image than in ailing soldiers a senior mccain adviser said they come despite repeated pledges by the republican that he will never question his rivals patriotism asked repeatedly for the reports bounds provided three examples none of which alleged that obama had wanted to take members of the media to the hospital

1856501 he enjoyed what he was doing and was proud to be in the army
1856502 at the same time he knew the risks he wanted to remind me how very much he cared for his brothers and sisters he asked me to tell them that if the worst happened
1856503 he said it happened very quick and that my son didnt suffer
1856504 he told me my son never knew what hit him
1856505 he was really my best friend he seemed more focused when he came home he had goals he wanted to go to college when he got out of the army

1856507 it is a serious matter that members of the armed forces clandestinely leaked news without coordination with their superiors
1856508 cnn declined to buy the material at the price being asked it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images
1856509 said that when the helicopter was about to land he saw so many guerrillas that he got terribly nervous and fearing for his life he pulled a piece of cloth with the red cross emblem out of his pocket and put it over his vest
1856510 it is serious that in the initial investigation of the operation the whole truth did not emerge
1856511 serious concern over what appears to have been a deliberate misuse of the red cross emblem
1856512 if authenticated these images would clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
1856513 complete and total respect for the red cross emblem is essential if the icrc is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence
1856514 should not tarnish the results of the operation which we are all still celebrating
1856515 the information initially obtained from the presidents office was apparently not so accurate
1856516 the emblem was misused with the wrong intentions that is not a good thing because humanitarian efforts could be affected
1856517 a violation of international humanitarian law whether or not it generates security problems

1856520 we learn that jesus was a wise man who did surprising feats taught many won over followers from among jews and greeks was believed to be the messiah was accused by the jewish leaders was condemned to be crucified by pilate and was considered to be resurrected
1856521 we learn that jesus was conceived out of wedlock gathered disciples made blasphemous claims about himself and worked miracles but these miracles are attributed to sorcery and not to god
1856522 how many other sources report the same details about this person
1856523 it makes a whale of a difference in english if you say dog bites man or man bites dog sequence matters in english but in greek it doesnt one word functions as the subject of the sentence regardless of where it stands in the sequence
1856524 in real terms the new testament is easily the best attested ancient writing in terms of the sheer number of documents the time span between the events and the documents and the variety of documents available to sustain or contradict it there is nothing in ancient manuscript evidence to match such textual availability and integrity

1856528 for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish so the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
1856529 we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the gentiles who will mock him and spit on him flog him and kill him three days later he will rise
1856530 many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
1856531 many other signs therefore jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these have been written that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you may have life in his name
1856532 it may be stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted a biblical reference

1856607 he must be called the saviour of humanity i believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much needed peace and happiness
1856608 i believe in one god and mahomet an apostle of god is the simple and invariable profession of islam the intellectual image of the deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the honor of the prophet has never transgressed the measure of human virtues and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion
1856609 if greatness of purpose smallness of means and astounding results are the three criteria of human genius who could dare to compare any great man in modern history with muhammad
1856610 philosopher orator apostle legislator warrior conqueror of ideas restorer of rational dogmas of a cult without images the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire that is muhammad as regards all the standards by which human greatness may be measured we may well ask is there any man greater than he

1856612 these and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle when i closed the 2nd volume of the prophets biography i was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great life
1856613 how one man single handedly could weld warring tribes and wandering bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades
1856614 muhammad was the soul of kindness and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him
1856615 the personality of muhammad it is most difficult to get into the whole truth of it only a glimpse of it i can catch what a dramatic succession of picturesque scenes there is muhammad the prophet there is muhammad the warrior muhammad the businessman muhammad the statesman muhammad the orator muhammad the reformer muhammad the refuge of orphans muhammad the protector of slaves muhammad the emancipator of women muhammad the judge muhammad the saint all in all these magnificent roles in all these departments of human activities he is alike a hero
1856616 my choice of muhammad to lead the list of the worlds most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels
1856617 it was the first religion that preached and practiced democracy for in the mosque when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered together the democracy of islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim god alone is great i have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity of islam that makes man instinctively a brother

1856620 aku hanya memikir setelah kitab itu mencelakai banyak orang walaupun benar benar mustika adanya sudah seharusnya dimusnahkan saja
1856621 cumalah aku itu waktu tidak dapat memikirkannya dulu hari suko pernah membilangi aku bahwa aku berbakat baik dan ulet tetapi aku un terlalu kukuh disebelah itu katanya aku kekurangan sifat wales asih kurang kedermawaan maka itu bagaimana pun aku rajin aku tidak bakal menyampaikan puncak kemahiran ketika itu aku tidak percaya suko aku pikir apa sangkutannya pelajaran silat sama sifat prikemanusiaan hanya sekarang adikku setelah berselang belasan tahun barulah aku mempercayainya adikku dalam ilmu silat kau kalah dengan aku tetapi dalam hal kejujuran hati lapang kau menang daripada aku maka itu dibelakang hari kau akan memperoleh hasil sepuluh lipat lebih banyak sayang suko sudah menutup mata kalau tidak pelajaran suko semua bisa diwariskan kepadamu suko oh suko kau benar
1856622 nanti habis bercerita aku boleh menangis pula ya kita sudah bercerita sampai di mana kenapa kau tidak membujuki aku supaya aku jangan menangis
1856623 koko bercerita sampai ong cinjin menyembunyikan kitab di bawah batu
1856624 setelah ia menaruh kitab di bawah batu itu aku minta suko memperlihatkan kitab itu padaku
1856625 suko tahu saatnya sudah tiba sesudah lantas mengurus segala apa mengenai partainya dan meninggalkan pesannya ia suruh aku mengambil kitab kiu im cin keng itu
1856626 ia pun menitahkan menyalakan api di perapian ia niat membakar itu selagi menantikan api marong ia pegangi kitab itu ia mengusap usapnya sembari menghela napas panjang ia berkata inilah hasil cape hatinya cianpwee mana dapat kitab ini termusnah di tanganku air itu dapat menampung perahu tetapi dapat juga mengaramkannya maka itu haruslah dilihat bagaimana orang orang di jaman belakangan dapat mempergunakan kitab ini cuma orang orang partai kita siapa pun tidak dapat menyakinkan ilmu ini supaya jangan sampai orang luar mengatakan aku merampas kitab ini sebab aku sekaker habis berkata begitu suko menutup mata malam itu jenazahnya ditunda di dalam kuil belum sampai jam tiga terjadilah onar
1856627 malam itu aku berada bersama sama tujuh murid coan cin pay menemani jenazah
1856628 tepat tengah malam musuh datang menyerbu semua mereka orang orang lihai ketujuh murid itu memecah diri untuk menyambut serangan untuk mencegah musuh bisa merusaki jenazah gurunya semua muridnya itu memancing musuh keluar kuil aku sendiri yang menjaga jenazah suko tiba tiba aku mendengar bentakan dari luar kuil menyuruh kita menyerahkan kitab musuh itu mengancam hendak membakar kuil aku melongok keluar aku mengeluarkan peluh dingin aku melihat seorang berdiri di atas pohon teranglah ia lihai daripada aku dalam hal enteng tubuh walaupun demikian terpaksa aku melawan dia aku berlompat keluar di atas pohon itu kita bertempur sampai kira kira empatpuluh jurus musuh itu lebih muda beberapa tahun daripada aku tetapi ia lihai dan telangas aku melawan keras dengan keras akhirnya pundakku kena dihajar dia aku terjatuh dari atas pohon
1856629 suko sudah begini lihai aku masih tetap tidak sanggup melawan dia siapakah dia itu
1856630 sebab adikmu berpikir orang yang terlebih lihai daripada toako adalah cuma mereka berlima yang mengadu pedang di hoa san
1856631 guruku ang cit kong orang terhormat toan hongya adalah hongya satu raja mesti ia menghormati dirinya sendiri pemilik dari tho hoa to itu adikmu tidak kenal baik tetapi melihat romannya dialah bukan satu manusia rendah yang suka menyerang orang yang lagi dirundung malang
1856632 oey lao shia itu pandai ilmu gaib maka itu tamannya ini diatur menurut barisan rahasia pat tin touw dari cu kat bu houw
1856633 oey lao shia itu sangat cerdas dia pandai main tetabuan main catur dan menulis surat indah dan menggambar dia juga mengerti obat obatan dan ilmu alam tak terkecuali ilmu pertanian serta ilmu memeriksa keletakan tempat yang indah juga ia paham ilmu perusahaan dan ilmu perang pendeknya tidak ada ilmu yang ia tidak paham maka sayang sekali jalannya sesat kalau dia mondar mandir di tamannya ini lain orang tidak akan dapat menyusul atau mencari padanya
1856634 apakah suko terbangun arwahnya apakah dia hidup pula bukan semuanya itu bukan suko hanya pura pura mati
1856635 benar beberapa hari sebelumnya suko menutup mata ia sudah ketahui see tok senantiasa berkeliaran di luar kuilnya untuk menanti begitu lekas ia meninggal dunia hendak ia merampas kitab kiu im cin keng itu maka itu malam itu suko berpura pura mati dengan ilmu kepandaiannya suko dapat menahan jalan napasnya kalau ia membuka rahasia pada semua muridnya pasti mereka tidak akan sangat berduka bukankah see tok sangat licin dari itu ia menutup rahasia habis menggempur tutup peti mati suko meloncat keluar untuk terus menotok see tok dengan totokannya it yang cie see tok kaget tidak terkira ia melihat tegas dari jendela suko telah menutup mata sekarang suko bisa berlompat keluar dari peti mati dia memangnya jeri terhadap suko sekarang ia kaget tidak sempat ia membela diri maka ia terkena totokan it yang cie pada alisnya dengan begitu pecahnya ilmu yang dinamakan kap moa kang atau ilmu kodok dia lari pulang ke wilayah barat kabarnya tidak pernah dia datang pula ke tionggoan suko tertawa panjang terus ia duduk bersemadhi di atas meja aku tahu dengan menggunai it yang cie telunjuk matahari suko telah menggunai tenaga terlalu banyak maka aku tidak ganggu padanya aku hanya lari keluar untuk menyambut ketujuh muridnya untuk memukul mundur semua musuh ketika semua keponakanku itu mendapat tahu gurunya belum menutup mata girangnya bukan kepalang semua lantas lari pulang hanya ketika mereka jadi kaget sekali semua mengeluh kecele
1856636 aku lantas menghampirkan dan meraba tubuhnya nyata tubuh itu dingin bagaikan es sekarang barulah suko berpulang ke alam baka kita lantas melaksanakan pesan suko ialah kitab dipecah menjadi dua bagian atas dan bagian bawah suko ingin kalau kitab sampai lenyap tercuri orang tidaklah tercuri semaunya aku yang menyimpan bagian atas lalu bagian bawah aku bawa ke sebuah gunung kesohor di selatan aku hendak menyembunyikan itu ketika di tengah jalan aku bertemu dengan oey lao shia
1856637 oey lao shia itu aneh tabiatnya tetapi dengan aku dia berjodoh bertemu beberapa kali dia tidak nanti kemaruk kitab seperti see tok
1856638 aku mendapatkan terang sekali cahaya mukanya oey lao shia itu maka untuk memberi selamat kepadanya sebagai mempelai aku undang dia untuk berjamu aku pun menuturkan halnya suko pura pura mati dan sudha menghajar auwyang hong mendengar ceritaku itu istrinya oey lao shia minta pinjam lihat kitab itu dia mengaku bahwa dia tidak mengerti ilmu silat dia mau melihat saking ingin tahu saja dia ingin melihat kitab yang sudah menyebabkan kebinasaan begitu banyak ahli silat kenamaan oey lao shia sangat menyintai istrinya itu tak ingin ia menolak keinginan orang ketika ia mendapatkan aku agaknya keberatan dia kata padaku pek thong istriku benar benar tidak mengerti silat dia masih muda sekali dia gemar melihat apa yang baru maka itu kau kasihlah ia melihat lihat ada apakah halangannya jikalau aku sendiri melirik saja kitabmu itu aku nanti korek biji mataku untuk diserahkan padamu oey lao shia ada satu jago pasti aku percaya padanya tetapi kitab itu sangat penting terpaksa aku menggoyangi kepala terhadapnya dia menjadi tidak senang dia kata mustahil aku tidak menginsyafi kesulitanmu kalau kau memberi lihat pada istriku ini satu kali saja nanti akan datang harinya aku membalas budi kamu pihak coan cin pay jikalau kau tetap menampik terserah padamu siapa suruh kita bersahabat dengan pihak coan cin pay semua anggotanya tidak aku kenal aku mengerti maksudnya itu dia biasa lakukan apa yang dia katakan dia tidak enak mengganggu aku tetapi dia dapat mencari alasan untuk mengganggu ma giok dan khu cie kee semua dia lihai sekali sungguh berbahaya kalau kalau ia sampai bergusar maka itu aku kata padanya oey lao shia jikalau kau hendak melampiaskan penasaranmu kamu carilah aku loo boan tong ciu pek thong perlu apa pula kau cari segala keponakan itu istrinya itu tertawa waktu dia mendengar aku menyebutkan julukanku loo boan tong itu ia lantas berkata ciu toako kau gemar sekali berkelakar baiklah kita jangan ngotot saja lebih baik kita pelesiran tentang kitab mustikamu itu tak apalah aku tidak melihatnya ia menoleh kepada oey lao shia untuk berkata terus rupanya kitab kiu im cin keng itu sudah kena dirampas si orang she auwyang maka itu ciu toako tidak sanggup melihat padaku maka juga apa perlunya kita memaksa dia juga boleh boleh dia menjadi hilang muka oey lao shia tertawa dia kata kau benar eh pek thong marilah mari aku membantu kau mencari si tua bangka berbisa itu untuk membuat perhitungan
1856639 maka itu aku menjawab mengadu gundu ya mengadu gundu mustahil aku takut nyonya oey itu tertawa ia kata ciu toako jikalau kau kalah kau kasih lihat kitab itu padaku jikalau kau yang menang kau menghendaki apa atas kata kata istrinya oey lao shia membilang coan cin kauw ada mempunyai mustika mustahil tho hoa to tidak ia terus membuka buntalanny adan mengeluarkan serupa barang hitam semacam baju yang ada durinya coba bade barang apakah itu
1856640 oey lao shia kata padaku pek thong kau bilang kau tidak membutuhkan ini untuk melindungi dirimu hanya kalau dibelakang hari kau menikah sama si bocah wanita nakal dan dia melahirkan bocah yang nakal kalau bocah nakal itu mengenakan baju lapis ini faedahnya bukan kepalang jikalau kau menang pusaka tho hoa to ini menjadi kepunyaanmu aku menjawab si bocah nakal tidak bakal terlahir tetapi baju lapismu ini sangst kesohor di dalam kalangan rimba persilatan kalau aku mengenakannya pastilah aku aksi sekali dengan begitupun biarlah diketahui tocu dari tho hoa to telah roboh di tangannya loo boan tong di bocah tua nakal lantas nyonya oey memotong aku katanya kau jangan omong saja sekarang mulailah kamu berdua sampai disitu cocoklah sudah lantas kita mulai kita memegang masing masing sembilan biji gundu kita membuat delapan belas lubang dialah yang menang siapa yang gundunya masuk paling dulu
1856641 bertiga kita pergi ke luar ke latar selagi keluar aku perhatikan gerak gerik istrinya oey lao shia aku dapat kenyataan dia benar tidak mengerti ilmu silat akulah yang membuat lubang di tanah lalu aku menyuruh oey lao shia yang mulai dalam hal menggunai senjata rahasia oey lao shia lihai istimewa dia mestinya menang daripada aku tetapi dalam hal main gundu ada lain tipunya aku membuat lubang yang istimewa kalau gundu masuk ke dalam situ gundu itu bisa keluar pula untuk itu aku mesti pandai mengimbangi menyentil gundu itu dengan begitu gundu jadi dapat berdiam terus di dalam lubang tiga kali oey lao shia menyentil tiga tiga gundunya masuk tepat hanya begitu masuk ketiganya lompat pula keluar aku telah memasuki lima biji semuanya tidak keluar lagi oey lao shia lihai ia mencoba menyusul tetapi gagal kembali satu gunduku masuk aku girang bukan main aku percaya aku bakal menang dia bakal kalah dewa pun tidak bakal berhasil membantui dia ah siapa tahu oey lao shia main curang dia menggunai akal coba bade apakah akal liciknya itu
1856642 bukan bukan oey lao shia busuk sekali tidak nanti dia pakai akal sekasar semacam itu dia tahu dia bakal kalah mendadak dia mengerahkan tenaganya dan menghajar tiga gunduku hingga habislah sisa semua gunduku gundunya sendiri lantas masuk ke dalam lubang
1856643 ya aku cuma bisa melihat dia main sendiri demikianlah aku kalah
1856644 mendengar perkataannya itu aku keluarkan kitab kiu im cin keng itu dan aku serahkan padanya dia menyambuti dia bawa itu ke bawah satunya pohon di situ ia duduk di atas sebuah batu lalu ia mulai membalik baliki lembarannya oey lao shia mengawasi aku ia dapat kenyataan hatiku tidak tentram ia kata padaku eh lao boan tong di jaman sekarang ini ada berapa orangkah yang dapat mengalahkan kita berdua aku menjawab yang dapat mengalahkan kau belum tentu ada tetapi yang dapat mengalahkan aku terhitung kau sendiri ada empat atau lima orang kataku tong shia see tok lam tee dan pak kay berempat mereka mempunyai kepandaian sendiri sendiri mereka tidak dapat saling mengalahkan auwyang hong telah dirusak ilmunya kap mao kang dalam waktu sepuluh tahun ia tidak bisa berbuat apa apa terhadap kita di dalam dunia kangouw terkabar ada tiat ciang sui siang piauw kiu cian jin tempo pertemuan di hoa san dia tidak hadir biarnya dia lihai aku tidak percaya dia lihai luar biasa loo boan tong bagaimana adanya ilmu silatmu aku tahu baik sekali selain beberapa orang yang sudah disebutkan barusan kaulah yang nomor satu maka itu kalau kita berserikat siapapun tidak bisa melawan kita atas pendapat itu aku menjawab memang oey lao shia berkata pula maka itu kenapa hatimu tidak tentram dengan adanya kita berdua di sini siapakah di kolong langit ini sanggup merampas kitab itu
1856645 aku pikir dia benar juga dari itu hatiku menjadi sedikit lega
1856646 mungkinkah auwyang hong telah dapat menukarnya selama ong cinjin belum keluar dari peti mati
1856647 tapi oey lao shia sangat licin sedang perkataannya nyonya oey itu aku tidak dapat percaya semuanya nyonya itu mengawasi aku yang menjublak saja ia rupanya menduga aku bersangsi maka ia berkata pula ciu toako bagimana bunyinya kitab kiu im cin keng yang tulen tahukah kau aku menjawab bahwa semenjak kitab itu berada di tangan kakak seperguruanku tidak pernah ada orang yang membacanya kakak pun membilangi selama tujuh hari tujuh malam ia bergulat mendapatkan kitab itu maksudnya untuk menyingkirkan suatu akar bencana besar untuk kaum rimba persilatan sama sekali ia tidak pernah memikir untuk memilikinya sendiri maka itu ia telah memesan semua murid coan cin pay siapa pun tidak boleh menyakinkan ilmu dalam kitab itu
1856648 ong cinjin demikian jujur ia mendatangkan hormatnya siapa juga berkata lagi nyonya oey hanya karena itu kena diperdayakan orang ciu toako coba kau periksa kitab ini aku bersangsi tetapi mengingat pesan kakak seperguruanku aku tidak berani memeriksa kitab itu inilah kitab ramalan yang terdapat di mana mana di wilayah kanglam berkata pula nyonya oey harganya tak setengah peser juga lagi pula taruh kata inilah kiu im cin keng yang tulen dan kau tidak ingin mempelajarinya apabila kau hanya melihat saja apakah halangannya aku terdesak aku pun penasaran maka akhirnya aku periksa kitab itu aku mendapatkan pelbagai pelajaran silat serta rahasianya sama sekali itulah bukannya buku petang petangan selagi aku memeriksa nyonya oey berkata kitab semacam ini aku telah membacanya habis semenjak aku berumur lima tahun aku dapat membacanya di luar kepala dari permulaannya sampai akhirnya kami anak anak di kanglam dalam sepuluh sembilan pernah bersekolah jikalau kau tidak percaya ciu toako mari aku membacanya untuk kau dengar benar benar ia membaca dari kepala sampai dibuntut membacanya dengan lancar aku merasakan tubuhku dingin lalu nyonya itu berkata pula halaman mana saja kau cabut dan tanyakan aku asal kau menyebut kalimatnya dapat aku membaca diluar kepala buku ini yang telah dibaca sejak masih kecil sampai tua juga aku tidak dapat melupakannya aku ingin mencoba aku uji ia beberapa kali benar benar ia bisa membaca dengan hapal tidak pernah ada yang salah maka itu oey lao shia tertawa terbahak bahak aku menjadi sangat mendongkol aku ambil kitab itu aku merobek robek terus aku sulut dan bakar hingga hangus habis
1856649 setelah itu mendadak oey lao shia kata padaku loo boan tong tidak usah kau ngambul dengan tabiat bocahmu itu nah ini bajuku yang berduri aku aku hadiahkan padamu aku tidak tahu bahwa aku telah dipermainkan aku hanya menduga karena merasa tidak enak hati hendak ia menghadiahkan kepadaku untuk membikin reda kemendongkolanku disamping mendongkol aku pun mengerti tidak dapat aku memiliki pusaka tho hoa to maka itu aku tolah hadiah itu aku membilang terima kasih padanya lantas aku pulang seterusnya aku mengunci pintu menyekap diri di kampung halamanku untuk menyakinkan ilmu silatku ketika itu belum sanggup aku menandingi auwyang hong dari itu aku berlatih keras selama lima tahun aku memikir setelah mendapatkan pelbagai macam ilmu hendak aku pergi ke wilayah barat untuk mencari see tok untuk meminta pulang kitab yang tulen itu
1856650 kalau toako pergi bersama ma totiang dan khu totiang bukankah itu terlebih baik lagi
1856651 aku menyesal karena tabiatku suka menang sendiri aku kena dipermainkan orang
1856652 setelah oey tocu mendapat kitab itu mungkin mulanya ia memikir untuk memberitahukan toako
1856653 hanya diluar dugaannya kitabnya itu kena dicuri muridnya yang jahat aku tahu betul mengenai kejadian itu dia murka bukan main hingga empat muridnya yang lainnya yang tidak tahu apa apa sudah dipotong kakinya dan diusir
1856654 umpama kata kau yang mengalami kejadian seperti itu kau pasti tidak menginsyafi bahwa orang telah tipu padamu ketika itu khu cie kee selainnya membicarakan urusan itu juga meminta pengajaran beberapa rupa ilmu silat padaku setelah beberapa hari ia berangkat pergi sesudah lewat dua bulan ia datang padaku kali ini ia membawa kabar kepastian bahwa tan hian hong dan bwee tiauw hong benar dapat ilmu kepandaian dari buku yang dicuri dari gurunya dengan menempuh bahaya khu cie kee mengintai hek hong siang sat dan mendengari pembicaraan mereka itu nyatanya oey lao shia mendapatkan kitab kiu im cin keng itu bukan boleh merampas kitab dari tangan see tok hanya boleh mencurinya dari tanganku sendiri
1856655 mungkinkah nyonya oey telah menukarnya dan toako diberikan kitab yang palsu
1856656 di dalam hal itu aku telah berjaga jaga selagi istrinya oey lao shia membaca tidak pernah aku memisahkan diri darinya dia tidak mengerti ilmu silat umpama kata dia sangat gesit dia tidak bakal lolos dari mataku bukankah kita yang pandai menggunai senjata rahasia mempunyai mata yang sangat awas dia bukannya menukar kitab hanya dia menggunai kecerdasan dan kekuatan otaknya untuk menghapalkan bunyinya kitab di luar kepalanya
1856657 adikku jikalau kau membaca sesuatu berapa kali kau membacanya untuk kau dapat membaca pula di luar kepala
1856658 yang sukar membutuhkan pembacaan dari enam sampai tujuhpuluh kali mungkin delapan atau sembilanpuluh kali
1856659 memang adikmu bebal sekali toako baik dalam hal membaca buku baik pun dalam hal belajar ilmu silat kemajuanku sangat lambat
1856660 mari kita bicara hal ilmu silat kalau gurumu mengajarkan kau suatu rupa ilmu silat bukankah itu memerlukan pengajaran berulang ulang beberapa puluh kali baru kau mengerti
1856661 akan tetapi di dalam dunia ini ada orang yang asal melihat orang berlatih dalam sesaat saja dapat ia menintainya
1856662 itulah benar umpama putrinya oey tocu ang insu mengajari dia cukup dua kali tidak pernah sampai tiga kali
1856663 nona itu demikian cerdas otaknya mungkin dia akan berumur pendek seperti ibunya
1856664 ketika itu hari nyonya oey meminjam lihat kitab ia cuma membacanya dua kali toh ia tidak melupakan satu huruf jua rupanya setelah berpisah dari aku segera ia mengambil pit dan kertas untuk mencatatnya setelah mana ia memberikan itu kepada suaminya
1856665 nyonya oey tidak mengerti tentang kitab itu cara bagaimana dia sanggup menghapalkannya
1856666 kenapa di kolong langit ini ada orang yang demikian terang otaknya
1856667 aku rasa sahabatmu yang cilik itu yaitu nona oey pun dapat berbuat demikian
1856668 setelah mendapat keterangannya khu cie kee itu aku lantas memanggil berkumpul tujuh murid coan cin pay untuk mendamaikan urusan itu guna bisa memaksa hek hong siang sat membayar pulang kitab itu
1856669 pantas kalau liok chungcu membenci hek hong saiang sat dia diusir gurunya tanpa bersalah cuma disebabkan hek hong siang sat yang bersalah yang sudah mencuri kitab
1856670 aku tidak dapat mencari hek hong siang sat itu sudah tentu aku mencari oey lao shia oleh karena aku khawatir nanti terhilang pula aku bawa bawa kiu im cie keng bagian atas itu setibanya di tho hoa to aku tegur oey lao shia dia kata padaku pek thong aku oey yok su jikalau akau kata satu tentu satu aku telah bilang tidak nanti aku melihat kitabmu itu aku pegang perkataanku kapannya aku melihat kitabmu itu kiu im cie keng yang aku baca ialah yang dicatat oleh istriku hal itu tidak ada sangkutannya dengan kau aku tidak mau mengerti maka itu kita jadi berselisih lantas aku minta dia kasih aku bertemu sama istrinya atas itu aku melihat ia meringis romannya berduka lantas ia ajak aku ke ruang dalam di sana aku terkejut untuk apa yang aku lihat istrinya sudah meninggal dunia di situ terlihat cuma meja abunya beserta sincienya aku ingin memberi hormat pada arwah nyonya oey itu tetapi oey lao shia kata padaku dengan dingin loo boan tong tidak usah kau berpura pura coba kau tidak mengoceh tentang kitab tulen dan yang palsu tidak nanti istriku meninggalkan aku aku jadi heran apa katamu aku tanya dia tidak menjawab dia mengawasi aku dengan murka kemudian mendadak saja air matanya mengalir lewat sesaat baru ia suka menerangkan tentang meninggalnya istrinya itu
1856671 istrinya oey lao shia itu ada seorang yang otaknya terang luar biasa untuk suaminya itu ia sudah mengingat baik baik bunyinya kitab kiu im cin keng yang ia pinjam lihat dari aku hanya dua kali membaca
1856672 dia telah menghajar patah kedua kakiku dia memaksa aku mengeluarkan kiu im cin keng bagian atasnya katanya untuk dibakar buat menyembahyangi arwah istrinya aku tidak serahkan kitab itu yang aku simpan di dalam gua ini aku sendiri menjaga di depan aku telah berkeputusan asal ia memaksa hendak aku meludaskan kitab itu atas sikapku itu oey yok su bilang bahwa akhirnya mesti ada jalan untuk dia mendapatkannya ialah dengan membikin aku meninggalkan gua ini marilah kita coba aku menantang demikian sudah terjadi aku berdiam saja di dalam gua ini aku mensia siakan tempo limabelas tahun dia tidak berani membikin aku kelaparan dia telah mempergunakan pelbagai macam tipu daya akan tetapi tetap dia tidak berhasil aku tidak kena dipaksa atau dibujuk hanya tadi malam hampir aku runtuh juga syukur kau datang mebolongi baiknya ada hantu atau malaikat yang bawa kau padaku jikalau tidak tentulah kitab itu sudah terjatuh ke dalam tangannya oey lao shia
1856673 hendak aku melewatkan waktu bersama sama oey lao shia untuk membuktikan dia yang terlebih panjang umur atau aku yang hidup terlebih lama
1856674 umpama kata mereka mendapat tahu tidak nanti mereka dapat masuk ke mari kecuali oey lao shia sengaja memberikan ketikanya
1856675 limabelas tahun lamanya aku melewatkan waktuku di tho hoa to ini selama itu aku tidak mensia siakannya di sini aku tidak pernah mengangkat kaki setengah tindak sekalipun hatiku pun tidak terganggu dengan begitu aku berhasil dengan peryakinkanku cobalah di tempat lain sedikitnya aku membutuhkan tempo duapuluh lima tahun aku merasa bahwa aku telah memperoleh kemajuan sayangnya aku tidak punya kawan untuk berlatih bersama sama karenanya terpaksa aku memakai kedua tanganku saja
1856676 tangan kananku aku umpamakan oey lao shia tangan kiriku adalah aku sendiri kapan tangan kanan memukul tangan kiri menangkis tangan kiri itu terus membalas menyerang demikian kedua tangan itu bertarung
1856677 toako barusan kau menggunai jurus di bawah pohon membereskan pakaian kau menggerakkan tangan kananmu kenapa tidak kaki
1856678 sekarang mari kita coba pula aku tidak akan pinjam tenaga di kaki itu
1856679 ilmu ini aku dapatkan selama sepuluh tahun aku berdiam di dalam gua ini
1856680 aku pun mendapatkannya secara tiba tiba semasa hidunya suko ia pernah omong halnya menyerang menggertak manjadi benar benaran dulu hari itu aku tidak menginsyafinya aku tidak perhatikan hanya kemudian baru aku memahamkan itu tadinya aku belum mempercayai penuh sebab aku cuma dapat berlatih belum pernah mencobanya sekarang barulah aku menguji terhadapmu adik mari kita mencoba pula kau jangan takut lagi beberapa kalli aku akan membuatmu roboh
1856681 adikku aku menggemari ilmu silat melebihkan jiwaku selama limabelas tahun aku mengharap harapkan ada orang yang bisa main main dengan aku buat beberapa jurus saja beberapa bulan yang lain putrinya oey lao shia telah ke mari ia omong banyak bisa menghibur aku hanya selagi aku ingin memancing ia untuk diuji dilain harinya ia tidak datang pula adikku yang baik tidak nanti aku merobohkan keras keras padamu
1856682 adikku yang baik tidak percuma aku membuatnya kau roboh nanti aku memberi penjelasan kepadamu tentang jurus ini
1856683 mangkok ini asalnya terbuat dari lumpur karena tengahnya dikosongi dapatlah dipakai mengisi nasi coba semuanya terisi ada apakah gunanya
1856684 inilah sangat sederhana tapi sebenarnya tadi tadinya belum pernah aku memikirkannya
1856685 karena di dalamnya kosong dan ada pintu dan jendelanya rumah itu dapat ditinggali kalau rumah itu terisi dan tanpa pintu atua jendela apa jadinya
1856686 demikian pula ilmu silat coan cin pay ilmu ini berpokok pada kosong dan lemas kosong dapat diisi dan lemas dapat dibikin keras
1856687 ang cit kong itu ahli gwa kee ilmu luar dia sudah sampai di puncaknya kemahiran maka itu meski aku mengerti ilmu silat coan cin pay mungkin aku bukan tandingan dia tapi ilmu luar itu ada batasnya tidak demikian dengan coan cin pay buktinya ketika kakak seperguruanku memperoleh gelar orang gagah nomor satu ia bukannya mendapatkannya itu karena beruntung tidak itulah karena kepandaiannya coba ia masih hidup sekarang setelah peryakinan lebih jauh belasan tahun apabila dia diadu pula tidak nanti dia memakai tempo sampai tujuh hari tujuh malam aku percaya dalam tempo satu hari saja dapat ia merobohkan semua lawannya
1856688 ang insu dengan hang liong sip pat ciang menjadi jagonya golongan ilmu luar dan toako barusan dengan ilmu silatmu yang manjatuhkan aku itu menjadi jago golongan lemas
1856689 memang lemas bisa mengalahkan keras hanya kalau hang liong sip pat ciang kau adalah semahir ang cit kong tidak dapat aku merobohkan kau semua itu tergantung sama dalam dan ceteknya peryakinan sekarang kau perhatikanlah
1856690 kalau kau sudah tidak sakit lagi mari aku mencoba merobohkan pula padamu
1856691 sakitnya sih tidak malah pengajaran barusan belum aku mengerti semua

1856917 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1856918 they didnt talk about one thing that they got as result of all those searches
1856919 i just dont think he did it and i dont think the evidence exists
1856920 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1856921 its closing a lot of things but its also opening up a lot of doors
1856922 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt

1856954 small group meetings and exchanges with the employers their amptp representatives and a core group of leaders in both organizations
1856955 progress doesnt have to occur directly across the table discussions through alternative channels are ongoing as we work toward a fair deal for actors as soon as possible
1856956 no meetings formal or informal regarding these negotiations have taken place since the sidebar sag requested on july 16 and no meetings are pending
1856957 the amptp is always interested in exploring ways to reach an agreement and if sag has an approach thats consistent with the parameters of our june 30 final offer then we are open to hearing that
1856958 sags negotiators have not discussed with us any plan to reach an agreement and the only meeting the parties are attempting to schedule is one to resolve some outstanding grievance claims
1856959 i would suspect that there have been informal talks in the course of business
1856960 theyre not negotiations not sidebars not subcommittees but people meeting because they have a reason to meet this comes up because everybody has this topic on their minds and i think sag is trying to characterize it as more than it is
1856961 i dont think that the sag leadership would have been so irresponsible to send out a letter to membership to say that smaller groups were having discussions if there werent discussions taking place
1856962 there are individuals within the business probably at high levels who are having conversations
1856963 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok

1856965 dr bruce ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1856966 we believe that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1856967 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1856968 the spores used in the attacks were taken from that specific flask
1856969 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
1856970 the investigation determined that dr ivinss role in the experiments were minimal and did not justify the time he spent
1856971 occasionally i get this tingling that goes down both arms
1856972 at the same time i get a bit dizzy and get this unidentifiable metallic taste in my mouth im not trying to be funny it actually scares me a bit other times its like im not only sitting at my desk doing work im also a few feet away watching me do it theres nothing like living in both the first person singular and the third person singular
1856973 it was literally resistant to every meaningful antibiotic that we had
1856974 so we had this report and i looked at it and said to myself my god this is an organism that basically we cant treat
1856975 they were very effectively moving the organism from one bed to the next
1856976 is that you take a capable micro rganism like klebsiella and you put it through the gruelling test of being exposed to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and it will eventually defeat your efforts as this one did
1856977 virtually all cases of mrsa were either in hospitals or nursing homes in the hospital setting they cause wound infections after surgery pneumonias and bloodstream infections from indwelling catheters but they can cause a variety of other infections all the way to bacterial meningitis
1856978 and then it started showing up in men who have sex with men
1856979 soon it began to be spread in prisons among the prisoners now we see it in a whole bunch of other populations
1856980 there are about a dozen new antibiotics coming on the market in the next couple of years
1856981 but there are no good drugs coming along for these gram negatives
1856982 the klebsiella that caused particular trouble in new york are spreading out
1856983 they have very high mortality rates they are sort of the doomsday scenario bugs
1856984 i was really interested to see whether we could find an antibiotic resistant population of bacteria in a place that had never seen antibiotics
1856985 they were at the time thought to be drugs of last resort because they had activity against a whole variety of multiply resistant gram negative bacteria that were already floating around
1856986 its a big problem and its contaminated the evacuation facilities in germany and a lot of the v a hospitals in the united states where these soldiers have been brought
1856987 seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in america end up in agriculture
1856988 the drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances these are perfect environments for disease and we also have found for reasons that i dont think we entirely understand that administering low levels of antibiotics to animals speeds their growth
1856989 believes that prudent drug use principles are essential to the control of antimicrobial resistance
1856990 antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are found in the air and soil around farms in surface and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry arb are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are cross contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices
1856991 the problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant
1856992 weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens
1856993 bad bugs no drugs as antibiotic discovery stagnates a public health crisis brews
1856994 most people would say that efflux is the most common form of bacterial resistance to antibiotics
1856995 this has been a problem in mediterranean europe that started about ten years ago
1856996 it started to get really serious during the last five or six years and has become really dramatic in greece
1856997 there are now a growing number of reports of cases of infections caused by gram negative organisms for which no adequate therapeutic options exist
1856998 this return to the preantibiotic era has become a reality in many parts of the world
1856999 anytime you hear about some kid getting snatched you want to find something in that story that will convince you that that family is different from yours
1857000 but the problem is that any of us could be an i c u patient tomorrow its not easy to convey this to people if its not immediately a threat you dont want to think about it but its actually anybody who goes into a hospital this is scary stuff
1857001 they developed a huge number of important anti microbial agents they had incredible chemistry and incredible research facilities and unfortunately they have completely pulled out of it now after squibb merged with bristol myers they closed their antibacterial program
1857002 fda approval of new antibacterial agents decreased by 56 per cent over the past 20 years 1998 2002 vs 1983 1987
1857003 antibiotics are the only class of drugs where all the experts as soon as you introduce them clinically we go out and tell everyone to try to hold it in reserve
1857004 if there is a new cardiology drug every cardiologist out there is saying that everyone deserves to be on it
1857005 the big picture did not receive the attention it deserved
1857006 as loud as my voice might be there are louder voices screaming bacteria
1857007 the difficulty that we are faced with is that our budget has been flat for the last five years
1857008 in real dollars weve lost almost fifteen per cent purchasing power
1857009 the problem is it is extremely difficult to do a prospective controlled trial because when people come into the hospital they immediately get started on some treatment which ruins the period of study
1857010 the culture of american medicine makes a study like that more difficult to execute
1857011 of course its only around ten million people so its possible to intervene because everything is smaller
1857012 maybe swedes are more used to this type of intervention and regulation
1857013 you are probably going to have to screen millions of compounds and you cant screen millions of infected mice
1857014 so our approach was to find an alternative host that could be infected with human pathogens which was small enough and cheap enough to be used in drug screens whats remarkable is that many common human pathogens including staphylococcus and pseudomonas will cause intestinal infection and kill the worms so now you can look for a compound that cures it that prevents the pathogen from killing the host
1857015 bacteria dont want to alert their host that they are there by immediately producing virulence factors which the host would recognize
1857016 when they reach a certain quorum there are too many of them for the host to do anything about it
1857017 its a great idea but so far nobody has been able to make it work for human infections
1857018 i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
1857019 i will play for united with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as ive always shown
1857020 hes never had a complaint about manchester united hes always been treated properly and i have a great relationship with the boy as do all the players
1857021 i think we can put this to bed now its finished the boys a united player and thats whats important
1857022 the fans have got to understand its very hard when a young boys tempted by all this money
1857023 hes a young lad from madeira and his father died a young man cristiano now looks after his mother sister and his brother so i can understand that money may have been tempting
1857024 you know it is a really nice hat if i hadnt worn it with so much pride which is a sin and maybe rick wouldnt be in so much purgatory right now prayers to you rick
1857025 no problem at all as long as we can get something to eat on the way home

1857027 a particularly obvious example involves the olympics which titor claimed as a result of the many conflicts no there were no official olympics after 2004 the uneventful staging of the 2006 winter olympics refutes this claim however there are arguments as to whether or not titor was referring exclusively to the summer olympics to those accepting this caveat it is the successful or unsuccessful realization of the 2008 summer olympics that will ultimately determine the accuracy of this claim
1857028 i guess his proponents can claim that john titor was not a fraud and that he must have visited the past from a different alternate timeline however as i am only interested in the timeline i am living in i am going to dismiss titor

1857032 there is no explicit requirement that xcel has to inform the commission before it rebills a customer for an inaccurate meter
1857033 however it is the scope of this thats concerning and its our expectation they xcel would have been in contact with our consumer staff earlier to work out any concerns our staff would have
1857034 it has all been very confusing for the people in their homes
1857035 with a colder than normal winter and with gas prices so high this rebilling just added to the trauma of all that
1857036 but when we think of those rules we think of them for isolated meters not 4 400 of them
1857037 had the insiders waited and conducted their transactions after the earnings report their proceeds would have been just 2 7 million a drop of nearly 40

1857041 walking through this park like area the memorial appears as a rift in the earth a long polished black stone wall emerging from and receding into the earth
1857042 as we turn to leave we see these walls stretching into the distance directing us to the washington monument to the left and the lincoln memorial to the right thus bringing the vietnam memorial into historical context we the living are brought to a concrete realization of these deaths
1857043 brought to a sharp awareness of such a loss it is up to each individual to resolve or come to terms with this loss for death is in the end a personal and private matter and the area contained within this memorial is a quiet place meant for personal reflection and private reckoning the black granite walls each 200 feet long and 10 feet below ground at their lowest point gradually ascending towards ground leve effectively act as a sound barrier yet are of such a height and length so as not to appear threatening or enclosing the actual area is wide and shallow allowing for a sense of privacy and the sunlight from the memorials southern exposure along with the grassy park surrounding and within its walls contribute to the serenity of the area thus this memorial is for those who have died and for us to remember them the memorials origin is located approximately at the center of the site its legs each extending two hundred feet towards the washington monument and the lincoln memorial the walls contained on one side by the earth are ten feet below ground at their point of origin gradually lessening in height until they finally recede totally into the earth at their ends the walls are to be made of a hard polished black granite with the names to be carved in a simple trojan letter the memorials construction involves recontouring the area within the walls boundaries so as to provide for an easily accessible descent but as much of the site as possible should be left untouched the area should remain as a park for all to enjoy
1857044 all these social networks i cant friging keep up with all these sites
1857045 ummm yeah it is different circumstances but ultimately the same thing

1857185 i cant make you love me right before i went out the door to the post office
1857186 for a country to have a great writer is like having a second government thats why no r gime has ever loved great writers only minor ones
1857187 during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
1857188 such an emergence seemed then to me and not without reason to be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my manuscripts and to my own destruction but on that occasion things turned out successfully and after protracted efforts a t tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later the printing of my work was however stopped almost immediately and the authorities stopped both my plays and in 1964 the novel the first circle which in 1965 was seized together with my papers from the past years during these months it seemed to me that i had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my work prematurely and that because of this i should not be able to carry it to a conclusion
1857189 literature that is not the breath of contemporary society that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers such literature does not deserve the name of literature it is only a fa ade such literature loses the confidence of its own people and its published works are used as wastepaper instead of being read
1857190 i am of course confident that i will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death but may it be that repeated lessons will finally teach us not to stop the writers pen during his lifetime at no time has this ennobled our history
1857191 woe to that nation whose literature is disturbed by the intervention of power because that is not just a violation against freedom of print it is the closing down of the heart of the nation a slashing to pieces of its memory the nation ceases to be mindful of itself it is deprived of its spiritual unity and despite a supposedly common language compatriots suddenly cease to understand one another silent generations grow old and die without ever having talked about themselves either to each other or to their descendants when writers such as interred alive throughout their lives are condemned to create in silence until they die never hearing the echo of their written words then that is not only their personal tragedy but a sorrow to the whole nation a danger to the whole nation

1857257 overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face falls in the prices of oil and some world food commodities such as wheat and soya provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising
1857258 the further sharp rise in the shop price deflator in july is worrying news for the bank of england while shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices the bank of england will also note that non food prices edged up year on year for a second month running in july after extended falls
1857259 by the end of the 1980s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

1857262 we only started to focus on dr ivins in 2007
1857263 we believe that on basis of the evidence we collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond reasonable doubt
1857264 we are confident that he was the only person responsible for the attacks
1857265 chain of evidentiary items that lead to only one conclusion
1857266 he may have been trying to create a scenario whereby people realised they would need to take the vaccine
1857267 he wasnt a fan of the steve mcqueen film he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
1857268 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue for someone who was actually there that was upsetting
1857269 for instance he thought the scene with the motorbike was well over the top a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
1857270 its a ridiculous question to ask who depicted my father really the film blends fiction and fact
1857271 there were people who made disguises made passes and permits and various things
1857272 they the guards were always on the lookout for tunnels but this particular one harry they didnt detect this was a masterpiece
1857273 i was a bit involved and i knew some of the people who died we were pleased so many got out but then word came back that 50 had been murdered that cast a different light on it
1857274 im extremely proud of my father and especially proud of his bravery and what he did for his country my father was happy to talk about his wartime experiences at some length when he was asked and wrote down his memories in great detail
1857275 but he had two memories which caused him great sorrow and pain the first was when he had to go on a bombing training mission in ireland he was supposed to be in the wellington but missed the flight the entire crew died and he felt a sense of guilt that he had survived it
1857276 we would prefer to retain psb status but not at any price
1857277 ofcom understands our predicament but does not quite understand the urgency never mind next year we could do with it next month there is an important connection between the goodwill impairment and the psb review
1857278 it is unarguable now that ofcom needs to take quick action to redress the imbalance between the value of the licence and that which we are required to provide
1857279 if this was a one month blip they wouldnt act this quickly to lower the dividend and take a goodwill impairment
1857280 the pace of deterioration and halving the dividend highlight that this is not hot air from michael grade and shows how urgently itv needs the process to go through
1857281 itv is outperforming commercial rivals and ad revenues are flat which is pretty good given the markets overall decline michael grade is trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear
1857282 in terms of how the second half will go we are positive about our capability but markets are difficult we expect to do well in the segments we work in but there is no way of guessing where the market overall will go
1857283 we have gone for a different part of the market from our competitors
1857284 we are less exposed to consumers ability to direct discretionary amounts towards savings we are more exposed to money in the market moving around the market
1857285 the environment remains challenging but comfort can be taken from the companys generally resilient performance in the period
1857286 acted in good faith and in the best interests of our clients both before and since auctions began to fail and there is simply no basis for claims to the contrary
1857287 neither we nor anyone else can predict when the housing market will fully recover and it would be folly to try to do so but i can promise you freddie mac will play a pivotal role in ensuring it does so
1857288 it would be an extremely ugly mortgage market that didnt have gses in it
1857289 it is likely that flaws in the design and workings of the systems of incentives within the financial sector have inadvertently produced patterns of behaviour and allocations of resources that are not always consistent with the basic goal of financial stability
1857290 this is really some of the most exciting news since the announcement of freespire 1 0 this is what we were hoping to see both the continued development of freespire and a return to a debian base
1857291 quite optimistic and im convinced he is going to carry on with us
1857292 he is a sporting player and thats it theres been plenty of rumours this summer and an offer was made but we rejected it because it wasnt interesting for the club
1857293 i do look at the clubs that have the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them and think thats probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful club
1857294 mark its not ok for people to dismiss those of us with disabilities in any way

1857299 mr key blamed labour activists for infiltrating the cocktail party saying some were ejected later in the conference weekend
1857300 as revelations go these are rather less remarkable than the method by which they were obtained
1857301 a defining aspect of 21st century politics is the pervasiveness of political spin and the tactics of media manipulation by political parties frankly if a lone activist with a 200 dictaphone can defeat the massed phalanxes of p r bullshit and thereby give the public a clearer idea of what the next government may actually do when elected then surely thats all to the good isnt it
1857302 as we grow we learn that even the one person that wasnt supposed to let you down probably will youll have your heart broken probably more then once and its harder every time youll break hearts too so remember how it felt when someone broke yours youll fight with your best friend and maybe even fall in love with them youll blame a new lover for things an old one did youll cry because time is passing to fast and youll eventually lose someone close to you so take too many picture laugh too much and love like youve never been hurt because every 60 seconds you spend angry or upset is a minute of your happiness youll never get back

1857684 a terra era nova ainda gerava em seu tero sua filha lua enquanto o pai c u trabalhava arduamente na noite plantando cada semente das estrelas do firmamento eram dias longos e de pouca luz dias cansativos no qual m e terra sentia as dores que viriam no parto e o pa c u se preparava para repousar eternamente deixando apelas seu filho trov o para guardar e proteger sua m e nessa terra antiga onde haviam rvores maiores que as montanhas viviam os p ssaros majestosos viviam os lobos filhos do trov o viviam tantos poderes selvagens e primitivos que a morte n o existia para nada a morte era apenas uma crian a que aprendia os des gnios de suas tarefas entendia que esse mundo seria escondido dentro de um novo que iria nascer e o tempo para que isso ocorresse seria quando sua irm lua estivesse pronta para sair do tero da terra morte apenas vagava como um esp rito da gua um esp rito que n o tinha sombra ou luz e que apenas podia ser sentido como um frio suspiro que a todos ali era tempor rio a morte conhecia cada aspecto da terra em seus caminhos aprendia os nomes primais de cada ser e os registrava em sua sabedoria e sempre que estava cansada descansava com seu grande amigo o condor ave maior no c u era o condor cujas asas pareciam abra ar o mundo e cujo bater delas criava o ar que os seres anci os respiravam a cada volta que o condor dava em volta do mundo a estrela pequena que m e terra e pai c u chamaram de sol despontava no horizonte e irradiava seu calor para a gesta o da lua condor e morte sabiam que um dia teriam de se separar quando n o mais fossem necess rias as asas dele para que o ar fizesse presente em m e terra e quando todas as criaturas daquele lugar viveriam com os filhos que condor semeava pelos quatro cantos de toda exist ncia foi quando os quatro filhos do condor receberam o sopro de vida que o condor sabia que seu papel n o mais era necess rio m e terra despediu se de pai c u e na despedida ele trouxe a luz a lua que havia nascido ela carregava ferimentos do nascimento e cicatrizes velhas do corpo de sua m e anci enquanto pai c u se afastava de m e terra em uma dan a que todos viventes pararam para vislumbrar a lua acompanhava em amor seu pai mas quando estava prestes a se afastar de sua m e sentiu o doce aroma da terra ouviu os cantos de felicidade de seu nascimento que os ventos sopravam entre as rvores rei o amor de lua era t o grande por sua m e e pai que escolheu ficar entre eles pela eternidade para que quando cada um deles olhasse para ela pudessem se lembrar do amor que havia gerado toda a manifesta o e ali naquele lugar onde ela escolheu andar a lua se fez mulher e o novo dia havia chego o sol saudou sua m e adormecida e quando seus primeiros raios tocaram a terra as montanhas se levantaram como bra os dormentes da m e que procuravam alcan ar seu amado condor passava os ltimos momentos de sua exist ncia ao lado de sua amada morte e ent o o sol chegou no ponto mais alto de sua jornada incumbido da mais rdua das tarefas ele anunciou que os mundos haviam se dividido a terra adormeceu a morte deu seu nico beijo ao condor para um sono eterno os ventos tentaram chorar l grimas mas apenas quando conseguiram se condensar em nuvens conseguiram chorar de tristeza e felicidade as rvores permaneceram im veis em sua sabedoria as montanhas crian a que se esticaram em dire o ao pai n o conseguiram entender a nova ordem e a nova raz o e no bra o mais longo da m e onde condor que semeou possibilidade de vida morava a morte cantava sua can o de passagem o condor n o mais respirou e seu corpo se tornou mole o cansa o se dissipou e ele havia sa do do bico de seu corpo tornou se luz intensa como seu irm o sol e abriu suas asas num v o em dire o ao pai toda vida que o condor havia alimentado e que agora os filhos tratavam de nutrir junto com o corpo da m e teria de receber um beijo de sua amada um dia agora s havia mudan a e muitos sentimentos se fizeram em flores animais e gente a exist ncia tomava in cio cada sopro novo dos filhos do condor era um sopro a menos para que a morte se aproximasse deles e o pr ximo a receber esse beijo de transforma o era lobo trov o que deveria explorar o outro mundo para que os caminhos fossem conhecidos pelos que o seguiriam depois acontece que morte ao beijar lobo trov o sentiu desespero de que um dia somente ela restaria fugiu ent o para o vale de onde lua havia nascido tentou se esconder de volta no tero da m e mas ele estava adormecido tamb m morte n o conseguia ouvir voz e canto de seus semelhantes e a dor pela saudade de seu amado condor despeda ou a em sentimentos somente irm lua que via tudo que estava acontecendo sem ser cegada pelos raios de seu irm o conseguiu entender aquela dor e levou ao conhecimento dos av s que antecediam m e terra e pai c u e os av s que n o conheciam tal solid o tal desespero e amor quebrado deram ao condor o dom de rever sua amada a viagem seria longa e condor fechou suas asas caindo em um razante de rel mpagos seu amigo lobo trov o havia assumido a tarefa do outro mundo e o condor poderia ser novamente presente com sua amada imortal naquele vale onde a lua nasceu e parte da morte se despeda ou a lua tomou parte dessa dor negra e da terra onde morte estava uma rvore pequena surgiu essa rvore com galhos de ossos possu a ra zes de sangue cujos frutos nasceram mortos como do ventre dela ela a lua que conheceu os lamentos da morte sem ter morrido que foi a ltima vida a sair da terra ela era a lua a testemunha de todo o novo mundo e quando a morte se dissipou tanto soprada pelos ventos filhos de condor estava pr xima a deixar de existir o condor deu seu grito e foi visto pela morte que primeiro foi cega pelos raios de sol foi confortada pelas palavras de lua e viu as asas de seu amado se abrirem denovo o poder e ess ncia de vida que condor tinha e toda necessidade de morte que eram prop sito da cria o se abra aram e se amaram e assim a morte se tornou menos triste e severa e o condor para jamais se afastar dela denovo seria aquele que levaria os mortos para as terras onde lobo trov o agora reinava condor se tornou meio morto e meio vivo pois amava e era t o amado pela morte que jamais seu beijo tirou lhe totalmente a vida foi na primeira noite que condor teve de se despedir de sua amada para cumprir suas tarefas que a noite dos mortos nasceu condor zumbi era o pai da noite dos mortos e a morte sua amada era aquela que sempre estaria por ele esperando

1857915 questa lo sar puoi non uccidere quelluomo ma per farlo dovresti allungare di ben tre giorni il vostro viaggio verso il castello giorni che non avete a disposizione uno vi serve per le cure che dovrai dare a tua madre una per intraprendere il viaggio attraverso garrisons peek ed uno nella pianura per arrivare alla caccia di primavera la vita di quelluomo o quella di molti altri perch se non lo farai saranno in molti a pagarne il prezzo ma parla con i tuoi compagni poich io non ho altro da dire a te o a loro per il momento
1857916 io non uccider pu dire tutto quello che vuole sar la prima volta che si sbaglia
1857917 ma ha anche detto che costerebbe al vita a molte persone
1857918 una va direttamente al castello mentre quella che passa da riverdall ci arriva ma ci vogliono proprio tre giorni di viaggio in pi
1857919 tre giorni non sono irriprendibili in un percorso di due settimane
1857920 non hai sentito se prendiamo quella via molta pi gente morir
1857921 ma temo che lunica cosa che possiamo fare uccidere noi quelluomo
1857922 qualsiasi strada prenderemo non abbiamo modo di sapere come sarebbe andata se avessimo preso laltra
1857923 non lo voglio in alcun modo ma sei veramente disposto a rischiare che vengano uccise molte persone
1857924 vorrei avessimo cavalli alati o simile ma non gli abbiamo
1857925 ma come facciamo a sapere che non sia quella decisione che provocher lincontro mortale non possibile
1857926 elisabeth ha un buon cuore e quelli come lei non sono mai pronti ad uccidere ma ci andiamo a cacciare in una guerra e lo sai anche tu uccider lo sapevamo dal momento in cui abbiamo accettato che venisse con noi sei un guerriero non dovrei dirti certe cose
1857927 non rimane altra scelta che affrontare la strada pi breve rischiando solo una vita e cercare come ha detto mara di essere noi a macchiarci le mani di sangue
1857928 o per lo meno cercheremo di fare quanto possiamo per evitare che tu sia costretta a farlo
1857929 a la campa a la tengo hecha porque no puedo dejar de pensar pero por ahora s lo tuvimos una charla todav a no me contrataron
1857930 me interesa porque creo que los latinos decidir n qui n es el pr ximo presidente de estados unidos si bien suena cool decir voy a votar a obama porque es negro y joven en el cuarto oscuro no lo van a votar tanto como dicen creo que para ganar debemos despegar la imagen de john mccain de george bush y que podremos contra obama
1857931 dicen que soy aburrido y despu s export su creatividad electoral para vicente fox en m xico y michelle bachelet en chile
1857932 en estados unidos no pueden participar extranjeros directamente en la campa a presidencial pero tienen una ley que permite que instituciones que apoyan a un candidato s puedan hacer campa a por su cuenta a m me llamaron algunos grupos de latinos que apoyan a mccain y est n interesados en que los ayude a comunicar a los hispanos la candidatura republicana

1857935 el voto de cobos no s lo impidi que se convierta en ley este aumento tributario que ha tenido en vilo a la econom a y la pol tica de argentina en los ltimos cuatro meses sino que ha supuesto una crisis de gobierno porque se ha opuesto a una iniciativa que la presidenta y su marido y antecesor n stor kirchner hab an planteado como de vida o muerte para su programa econ mico
1857936 la derrota por 37 a 36 es un gran traspi pol tico para el gobierno izquierdista sic que hab a invertido una enorme cantidad de credibilidad y capital pol tico en la cuesti n

1857938 this is something were looking at first in minneapolis and then in st paul but this is a much bigger issue than that
1857939 the impression that theres an increasing rate of autism in the somali community is definitely there and people are wondering whats going on
1857940 if theyre having more children many of the siblings also have autism we have a number of somali families who have two children on the autism spectrum and sometimes more ive been working to get somebody to look at this and pay attention because it feels like this is too specific to somalis its got to be preventable
1857941 theyre beginning to be aware that this is a huge issue in their community and theyre starting to come together and not isolate themselves
1857942 theyre given more vaccines then we get and sometimes theyre doubled up
1857943 then their children are given immunizations in somalia their generations have not received these immunizations and then suddenly theyre getting just a wallop of them in the moms and then in the babies thats certainly a concern thats been expressed to me by the somali population
1857944 research has not shown its related to shots or toxins kids who havent received immunizations have the same baseline for autism as those who have
1857945 children of somali immigrants born in the us get a bonus gift autism
1857946 more than two dozen current and former high ranking executives at freddie mac analysts shareholders and regulators said in interviews that mr syron had ignored recommendations that could have helped avoid the current crisis
1857947 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
1857948 there were two different ways of looking at the thain saga
1857949 if you think that yesterdays data had a clear cut message you missed the point take a step back and look again
1857950 those with a mission pick the adjustment that fits the viewpoint
1857951 the recessionistas did not get the negative gdp number they wanted so they object to the methodology
1857952 overdoing the doom one of his sources reported the start of a federal program of extended benefits
1857953 in short the news was a little negative but no big deal
1857954 the concept of real gdp is intended to measure physical quantities rather than dollar amounts so that if you paid a higher dollar price but purchased the same number of physical goods real gdp would be unchanged
1857955 i got hit on the head with a rock when i woke up id made my announcement and then it was too late

1857957 today by adopting the declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples we are making further progress to improve the situation of indigenous peoples around the world
1857958 we are also taking another major step forward towards the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all
1857959 this marks a historic moment when un member states and indigenous peoples reconciled with their painful histories and resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights justice and development for all
1857960 the 13th of september 2007 will be remembered as an international human rights day for the indigenous peoples of the world a day that the united nations and its member states together with indigenous peoples reconciled with past painful histories and decided to march into the future on the path of human rights
1857961 we are only calling for the right to live in peace on our land to be able to speak khmer to practise theravada buddhism to travel freely between cambodia and vietnam and to teach our history in our schools we also want the continual persecution of our people to stop

1857980 now one component of the fractious republican party foreign policy establishment the so called pragmatists some of whom have come to view the iraq war or its execution as a mistake is expressing concern that mr mccain might be coming under increased influence from a competing camp the neoconservatives whose thinking dominated president bushs first term and played a pivotal role in building the case for war

1858010 its like going shopping with a friend versus going alone
1858011 you get to bounce ideas off of each other and get new ideas its the kind of discovery that comes from shopping in a group that makes the site work
1858012 our social shopping site is a dynamic ever changing shopping magazine thats edited by hundreds of users
1858013 were a very active community and offer a large variety of social shopping tools
1858014 the people who recommend the most are driven by status and recognition
1858015 theres a real healthy competition that goes on to be the most influential people
1858016 once you get a shopping personality going youll develop a following
1858017 stylehive isnt where the final decision to buy something is made its the starting point and to be where decisions begin is important to retailers
1858018 it used to be the magazines telling you what to wear

1858026 regardless of our losses im ready to send replacements of planes and crews and continue building up our strength the opposition isnt nearly what it was and we are wearing them down the loss of 60 american bombers in the schweinfurt raid was incidental
1858027 loss of 60 american bombers in the schweinfurt raid was incidental
1858028 the allied air attacks remained without decisive success until early 1944
1858029 this failure which is reflected in the armaments output figures for 1943 and 1944 is to be attributed principally to the tenacious efforts of the german workers and factoiy managers and also to the haphazard and too scattered form of attack of the enemy who until the attacks on the synthetic oil plants based his raids on no clearly recognizable economic planning
1858030 armaments production would have been materially weakened over a period of two months and would have been brought to a complete standstill at the end of four months if
1858031 1 all ball bearing plants had been attacked at one and the same time
1858032 2 the attacks had been repeated three or four times at intervals of fourteen days each without regard to the bomb plots
1858033 3 each attempt at reconstruction had been attacked every eight weeks by two consecutive heavy raids and if the execution of this total bombing policy had been continued for six months
1858034 the destruction of the ball bearings industry at the cost of a small expenditure of effort would have caused a complete standstill of armaments and war production within a period of four months and in certain important spheres even within fourteen days to eight weeks
1858035 the variation in destructiveness of bombs was very great so that it is impossible to state any coefficient of the number of machines destroyed or damaged per bomb hit
1858036 es is kein ger t zur ck geblieben weil w lzlager fehlten
1858037 the eighth air force had temporarily lost its air superiority over german targets
1858038 the incalculable advantage of a breathing spell from further attacks for another four months
1858039 was granted the germans who regarded the omission on the part of the army air forces as nothing less than miraculous
1858040 virtually marked the end of the strategic bombing attacks on schweinfurt
1858041 by the beginning of 1945 before the invasion of the homeland itself germany was reaching a state of helplessness
1858042 if we fail to recognize this we lose moral clarity the legitimate differences among us the shades of gray in a free society will be wrongly perceived as black and white then the real black and white line that divides free societies from fear societies the real line that divides good from evil will no longer be distinguishable
1858043 people cannot distinguish between religious fundamentalists in democratic states and religious terrorists in fundamentalist states it is why people living in free societies can come to see their fellow citizens as their enemies and foreign dictators as their friends

1858049 18 years ago we fought the low level dump here and i was part of that and then we fought it again three years ago
1858050 it just seems like were a dumping ground for everyone elses trash and thats what a waste dump is and we dont want it we have enough problems were trying to deal with now
1858051 when you have a 90 rate saying they dont want it it should have been settled
1858052 this is just treachery i guess you can say that i just cant believe south carolina thought they could throw the dump in north carolina with out us saying a word
1858053 everyone knows im in over my head over my head
1858054 sam being protective of the boys something unusual being used as a weapon and sg 1 dealing with an offworld matriarchal society
1858055 state your purpose or we shall be forced to remove you from our land
1858056 this is doctor daniel jackson colonel jack oneill and tealc weve come to talk and trade
1858057 you heard the lady now why dont you put down your weapons so we can get down to business
1858058 i cant be certain since its an extinct language that hasnt been
1858059 i think there must be some rules governing communication on this planet you should step forward and engage with the leader ill talk to jack and tealc
1858060 then wed like to be sure we honor your domain
1858061 come major samantha carter of sg 1 you shall ride with me
1858062 they shall ride in the chariot behind us as to not tire their feet
1858063 when we get to town were having a little chat
1858064 they are a healthy strong bunch are all your men the same
1858065 but they are a beautiful kind race we are good to them
1858066 and we will show you the greatness and hospitality of the sinnu
1858067 sir we have to honor their ways and join the feast
1858068 sams right you have no idea how important this is
1858069 there are goddess worship cults and ancient societies that have more of a female consciousness to them but society and culture itself has always been patriarchal at least to our knowledge in both recorded history and the archaeological record
1858070 even off world we havent encountered anything like it before this is a rare find jack its worth exploring
1858071 for the sake of finding out why and how they became a matriarchal
1858072 i do not see any reason for us to engage in trade
1858073 sir weve seen in the past that we cant judge a people based on first impressions alone
1858074 this has nothing to do with how primitive or how advanced they are
1858075 you complained all the way to the city about the injustice of this place and how no one would talk to you
1858076 no im not happy about it but its still an amazing find maybe sam can talk anu into letting us have some privileges and extra freedoms as guests
1858077 on our way into the city i noticed an abundance of strategically placed alien technological devices throughout the ziggurat and associated buildings id like the opportunity to discuss them with anu to better understand their function and see if they would be offered in trade
1858078 they could be a form of advanced defense shield technology something that we could use in our fight against the goauld
1858079 but if i have to wear a dress we are so out of here
1858080 most scholars have theorized that societies that are matriarchal in composition would be more egalitarian but here it seems the women are completely in charge i havent seen a man in any positions of authority
1858081 as long as you let me handle the discussions and dont speak out well be fine
1858082 id like to learn more about their history maybe figure out how they grew to be such a strong society
1858083 aya this is major samantha carter of sg 1 she has come through the apsu
1858084 its a complimentary title used between the women here im guessing
1858085 he is very strong and very beautiful i have never seen a man like him
1858086 i am honored that you believe this to be so
1858087 we have many things to discuss and empty bellies to fill
1858088 i would like for us to talk trade if possible
1858089 we travel searching for new medicines technology and defense weapons to protect ourselves in turn we are willing to offer medicines and supplies of our own
1858090 i have noticed that you have taken interest in our defensive shields
1858091 im interested in how your technology interfaces with your city
1858092 surely if your men are strong your women are stronger why would you need such defensive weapons
1858093 but we are a cautious people and we like to take as many steps as possible to protect ourselves
1858094 i understand i would be as protective as you if my men were like yours
1858095 do not worry over them they will be safe here i shall guarantee it
1858096 and i will agree to allow you to study our devices however we of the sinnu ask trade in return
1858097 we would like the secrets to how you make your men so strong
1858098 your men seem to have a great love for talking
1858099 it is true your customs must be different than ours
1858100 can you ask for some books if they keep insisting that were strong that must mean that their men are uh not as strong
1858101 id like to see if i can figure out why
1858102 we would gladly share with you how we make our men strong
1858103 but in order for us to be thorough we would like access to some of your historical documents for comparison purposes
1858104 our history is our life our tools are our protection
1858105 i just want to learn about your people so we can become better friends
1858106 but are you certain it is wise to put such a strain on your men
1858107 she does not wish torture on such a fair race
1858108 we mean no harm we have no desire to hurt anyone not even our own
1858109 i understand that your men are strong but they are not infallible
1858110 i am troubled you wish to push them to such lengths men are of feeble minds
1858111 i believe there may be a difference in our peoples
1858112 most of our men and our women are strong in mind and body
1858113 but our men do take on active roles in our lives
1858114 however there appear to have been several modifications made to the walls
1858115 urshanabi was always stronger than most i taught him to read and to manage some of the finances but over the past few years he has become weaker
1858116 men are not made for this kind of stress no matter how strong they are
1858117 i urge you to reconsider placing such pressures on your men
1858118 but some of them succumb to the blight more so than others
1858119 you do not follow our rules i will not have you speak outwardly to my mother any longer
1858120 if they are able to speak let them speak i will deem when they will be silent
1858121 continuous defiance of the rules shall make the goddess angry
1858122 our men are weak from the blight only those that are taxed beyond their abilities become damu
1858123 book tablets anything maybe we can help figure out why your men are born with the blight
1858124 female ones at that we can send some people over here have them take a look and see if theres something we can do
1858125 all of this in exchange for our books and some of our technology
1858126 but wed appreciate a look at your shields and any other gizmos you might have oh
1858127 but we would only ask for the metal in ways that would not harm you
1858128 any books that you need are yours tablets scrolls i shall have all of them delivered to your suite including information on our shields
1858129 i have set you up in my best suite ningal and aya will show you the way
1858130 i think i found the ladies room whoa talk about fancy
1858131 we have a rings system in the hallway it makes transportation of large goods easier
1858132 you should not be in need throughout the night but if you require assistance there is a communicator on the wall
1858133 and the books are from my personal collections if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me
1858134 oh like a vizier you would be the best one to know about customs and rituals associated with the goddess
1858135 nammu is our supreme goddess when she returns you may ask her
1858136 do you think this nammu goddess is on her way back
1858137 nammu was killed in battle by ras forces many years ago
1858138 yup now you know how it feels when im in charge
1858139 if you hadnt taken four hours to eat one damn plate maybe we would have shown some better manners
1858140 were trying to impress these people our aerial surveys show high concentrations of naquadah in their soil
1858141 right now im thinking thats the least of our worries
1858142 i cant believe im going to say this but i think jacks right

1858156 although no differences in condom use were identified between marijuana users and non users results suggest that marijuana users are engaging in sexual acts with riskier partners and under riskier circumstances and had higher rates of stds
1858157 if you could have either sex or cake what would you choose
1858158 sam being protective of the boys something unusual being used as a weapon and sg 1 dealing with an offworld matriarchal society
1858159 i will shoot you you know i will you know its what daniel wants
1858160 carter if were goauld you know we can break through these tealcs already tried the restraint trick before with hawkins and rothamn
1858161 im sorry sir but i can only trust my instincts on this one
1858162 when we reach the room i need you to try to sense naquadah in daniel and colonel oneill
1858163 at first i thought they had been taken as hosts
1858164 tealc and sam are trying to protect us somethings wrong
1858165 sir this goes way beyond testosterone deficiency somehow you have trace amounts of naquadah in your system
1858166 for me to be able to detect the naquadah it means you have to have concentrations large enough to be noticeable
1858167 i dont have a sudden epiphany that junior is close by
1858168 well its not nearly enough to reach levels of a goauld is it
1858169 i cant be certain but i believe that you have either ingested small amounts of naquadah or absorbed it through your skin
1858170 tealc is probably affected as well but its masked by the properties of the symbiote
1858171 it is possible that my symbiote can absorb the naquadah
1858172 i think the three of you should report to the infirmary immediately
1858173 the crystals sir someone has taken one of the crystals necessary to power the dhd
1858174 i believe the stargate is our only way off this world oneill
1858175 tealc if they can cloak their city they have other stuff
1858176 daniel did you find anything when you were reading through those rubbings last night
1858177 i warned you this would happen i told you that you could not push them as you did
1858178 did you not understand did you wish for your men to become as damu
1858179 you know they are different than the men you govern you know how strong and lucid they were you saw them yesterday you know this doesnt happen in one day
1858180 you said yourself that the men here are born with this disease
1858181 take your belongings and leave this world to protect them
1858182 i would but someone has sabotaged the stargate so we cant leave
1858183 were trapped here its clear why its never been about genetic problems its been poison all along
1858184 you knew that wed figure out what was really happening
1858185 aya if you are not honest with me i shall banish you from this palace
1858186 give me the truth do it not for me but for your father
1858187 i did it for you i did it for you and for father
1858188 she said the goddess would be angry she said nammu would punish you for giving so much to father just as the other women had been punished before you
1858189 ningal told me to take the crystal she told me not to let the strangers leave
1858190 ningal knew that once we entered the temple wed figure out the truth
1858191 we can read the sacred text that has been kept from you she knew that once we figured out that the men on this planet were intentionally poisoned we would expose her
1858192 i do not expect this to be a clean confrontation
1858193 i need that crystal to get back to my world its the only way i can help them
1858194 we can come back and help you we might be able to help your people
1858195 we have a ship for scouting it is stashed in our upper west level
1858196 is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
1858197 ok badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
1858198 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1858199 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
1858200 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1858201 bretts ready to go play it looks like its going to be new york or tampa bay were waiting to find out and we could learn in the next hour or so

1858203 sam being protective of the boys something unusual being used as a weapon and sg 1 dealing with an offworld matriarchal society
1858204 i was out like a light tealc i need to be more alert
1858205 i said rest im sure theres no harm in getting your fair share of kelnoreem
1858206 the language and writing has evolved since last on earth and they have adapted cuneiform to be used on a variety of different media
1858207 the cuneiform on nems planet was akkadian and that was hard enough and i could only make out half of the rules we read earlier
1858208 the sheer volume of material alone is enough to keep me busy for a lifetime but
1858209 as far as i can tell not a whole lot
1858210 just that nammu put the blight on the men before she left the planet
1858211 the details are vague something about the women are stronger dedication temple something something other than that much of their text is just a reiteration of the rules in place governing male and female behavior
1858212 most of their medical terminology is lost on me but i can make out words and phrases
1858213 we probably should have doctor fraiser take a look at them
1858214 i cant be certain for sure but im reading that the
1858215 uh aside from being treated for muscle weakness fatigue poor
1858216 theres no way we can be certain that you havent been exposed to anything on the planet
1858217 however based on the information daniel has found and the statements from our hosts there is little reason to fear an all out contagion
1858218 well the men are given gishtil to fight off the blight now gishtil roughly translates into vehicle of life which would make sense if they were given supplements
1858219 there might be goauld schematics locked inside that i could use to reference the ones that anu provided for us
1858220 and help me place the cuneiform texts into context if i can find a point of reference
1858221 if nammu was experimenting on these people shes bound to have some kind of log in goauld that either tealc or myself can read
1858222 you do realize this is not going to go over well with the ladies
1858223 if they are able who is to say they cannot enter
1858224 the temple is my domain just as the government is yours
1858225 ningal i shall speak with you outside siduri see to them
1858226 if you wish to enter the temple you must be clean
1858227 i mean no disrespect irnini sam but what are these that your men carry
1858228 you know that my men are not like your own we have been carrying our belongings for over a day without any problem
1858229 and i have been patient with your ways for just as long
1858230 i am afraid that i must ask them to lay down their weapons it is for them and for us
1858231 sir please if we want access to the temple we need to cooperate
1858232 we will not harm you you are all under my protection
1858233 indeed it is i believe it will serve you well on your way to the temple
1858234 but i need to speak with you about your men
1858235 i know that your men are strong stronger than any i have ever seen and i give you many liberties as an honored guest however
1858236 our ways are not your ways and we do not take kindly to deception i have allowed for your men to carry their concealed weapons and for your jaffa to keep his staff but i warn you to take care in your choices irnini where i may offer you safety and protection i do not have eyes that see all i fear that you may anger the wrong people
1858237 do you have enemies we should know about are you in need
1858238 your kindness warms me irnini and i know that you are just all i ask of you is to keep your men in their place
1858239 sir i need to have a word with you its important
1858240 sir i feel its imperative that we keep a low profile here
1858241 no sir i really believe she has our best interests in mind
1858242 i know what youre thinking i dont like it any more than you do but well go to the temple check in with general hammond and then we can decide where to go from there
1858243 extremely necessary and the least we can do is to try to help these people not to mention it might benefit us in the long run
1858244 well were never going to get any answers if we dont ask questions
1858245 you mean to say we came all this way and youre not going to let us inside
1858246 did we not just undergo the rite of purification before traveling here
1858247 is there anything they can do to enter the temple sam asked
1858248 i couldnt help but notice that during our walk here there were no children
1858249 sir if the men are suffering from some form of erectile dysfunction then it would make sense that there would be a low birth rate
1858250 we were wondering how the population sustained itself if they have a low birth rate and a small population then they might actually have enough resources to maintain their numbers
1858251 if it is indeed true that the men of this world are born with this inability then it is possible the goauld have tampered with them
1858252 why would a goauld make efforts to effectively destroy her own power base
1858253 but its worth finding out maybe perky there knows something
1858254 it is the remains from our most holy of lizards
1858255 i have allowed you to bless me to show my support in the actions of major carter
1858256 i do not believe in your goddess nor will i enter her place of worship
1858257 i will be fine i will stand guard while you explore the temple
1858258 its an obscure dialect but i can make out most of it tealc can always help with the rest
1858259 it is not i will take you to the tablets
1858260 the altar inscriptions talk about her being mother of the gods and
1858261 not hathor but im pretty sure shes a goauld queen in babylonian she could have been known as tiamat
1858262 yes and theres no saying she is the same goauld remember the goauld have taken names for various earth mythology they may be different or they could be related for all we know
1858263 it doesnt just say shes creator of all it says shes creator of man
1858264 so were going with the theory that nammu somehow genetically altered these men
1858265 im figuring that she must have some more information describing her accomplishments stored on tablets or other records
1858266 i think our history has shown us the goauld are nothing if not self absorbed
1858267 this describes some of our history i believe that you would be interested in this one
1858268 you cannot stay in the temple to read these and it would be too strenuous to carry all of these back
1858269 oh i agree but i dont need to bring them back with me
1858270 well find out when i have a chance to better look at the text
1858271 it turns out the aerial survey was correct theyve got naquadah and a bunch of other gizmos that they seem willing to share
1858272 sir weve agreed to help the sinnu with a medical anomaly
1858273 there seems to be a medical situation among the men on this planet sir
1858274 we believe some kind of reproductive problems with the men
1858275 weve noticed a very small population and the men appear to have a loss in bone and muscle mass
1858276 in fact all men experience a decrease in testosterone as they age a congenital cause would be genetic and an acquired cause could happen at any point in a mans life acquired testosterone deficiency usually happens through damage to the hypothalamus pituitary gland or the testes
1858277 sometimes it can happen through disease how are you doctor jackson and tealc feeling
1858278 id really like to have a look at those affected and run some tests
1858279 is it not abnormal for the majority of a population to suffer from such an affliction
1858280 tealc you want to show our friend your neat eyebrow trick
1858281 well after encountering some resistance we were finally able to
1858282 right the inscriptions i found within the temple discuss experiments that nammu performed on the male population
1858283 apparently she was attempting to perfect a method of weakening the male forces probably jaffa and other slaves used by other goauld and to give herself more power she was out to take ras place in the goauld family tree
1858284 so what does this have to do with your current situation
1858285 the priestess of the temple has been aware of the medical condition of the men on this planet and has kept it a secret
1858286 they obviously didnt want us to know what the goauld did to the men on this planet
1858287 at first i thought maybe it was a measure to keep stability on the planet and not throw their whole society into chaos
1858288 but now im thinking that they wanted to just keep the status quo
1858289 just a hunch ive found some key words and references in the rubbings ive sampled from the temple i need some time to read through them and make sure i have the proper context
1858290 i have orders to do whats necessary to acquire naquadah for our weapons program or any available technology
1858291 there are some shall we say sensitivities on this planet
1858292 no sir though we did promise the leadership here some medical help
1858293 i can have doctor fraiser assemble a team and have her meet you at the gate at oh seven hundred hours
1858294 that will give you enough time to gather additional information
1858295 good i want major carter to stay in charge of the negotiations i expect you to be on your best behavior colonel
1858296 she gave me one of these so we could reenter the city tomorrow afternoon when janet and her team arrive
1858297 there is a part of the text that goes into
1858298 let daniel work it off for now once he figures something out hell forget about it
1858299 unless you believe that i am who i claim to be you will die in your sins
1858300 gods light came into the world but people love the darkness more than the light
1858301 but god showed us his great love for us by sending christ to die for us while we were still sinners and since we have been made right in gods sight by the blood of christ he will certainly save us from gods condemnation
1858302 god saved you by his grace when you believed and you cant take credit for this it is a gift from god
1858303 salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done so none of us can boast about it
1858304 no power in the sky above or in the earth below indeed nothing in all creation will ever be able to seperate us from the love o god that is revealed in christ jesus our lord
1858305 dont you see the freedom you could have from that weight on your heart that peace is there for the taking so take it already

1858356 but you did not answer my question where did you hear that i was a potential turncoat
1858357 we know that you are disloyal to master lu and we need you to help us eliminate him
1858358 are you certain that we are talking about the same person
1858359 he is an enemy of the state and of the people
1858360 but you do not control the state and the people are not on your side
1858361 then he is an enemy of the theoretical state and of the soon to be convinced people in any case he must be purged
1858362 the list of people to be purged must be very long if that is all it takes to get on it
1858363 and it is going to get longer if a certain acolyte continues to be a smart aleck
1858364 we want you to spy on master lu and sabotage his counter revolutionary activities
1858365 it is a little copper coin with a square hole in the middle

1858368 i am all for turning coats but seriously one w n the free room and board i earn here is worth more than that and it does not even come with a mattress
1858369 it would be ideologically inconsistent of us to pay you an abnormally high wage

1858373 i think i shall have to pass on your offer fake talking bush

1858469 is the church more focused on the cliches of christianity than the actual gospel itself
1858470 is it right for fundamentalists to indoctrinate children with their beliefs
1858471 a common law demands uniformity but the gospel spreads individuality in fellowship life in accordance with the gospel is life in recognized and accepted personal individuality but an individuality that is charismatically alive a personality that is lived in and for the community and an independence that does not suppress originality but sets it free and develops it in relationship to forefathers and contemporaries life in accordance with the gospel cannot have anything to do with either legalism or lawlessness for it looks for forms of the liberated life in experience and for forms of lifes liberation in practice the messianic gospel liberates life it gives it bearings and meaning it gives its stamp to life in the spirit

1858487 no the sun is its barrenness for it steals the water from the thirsty kernels
1858488 he is a slave a forlorn one that chases his captor and love the moon whom he shall never have
1858489 what god can be restrained or be a slave to the moon or to anything it is the wine of gods this power that exempts them from constraints
1858490 perhaps the retirement of the sun as a god at night is not one of compulsion but of knowledge that the kernels of corn would shrivel if it remained and drown if it never returned
1858491 you believe in gods and thusly see them in everything the sun is no more a rose than it is a god

1858500 indeed how do i really know that i am talking with a real person and what is a real person i might add it all depends on your reality
1858501 rather live life with god and get to the end and find out that there is none than live life without god and get to the end and find out that there is one
1858502 he catches the wise in their own craftiness and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end

1858505 who has measured the spirit of the lord or what man shows him his counsel

1858507 what after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of god

1858510 creator i am thy creation out of clay hast thou fashioned me and to thee i owe mine all
1858511 father i am thy son in pity and love thou hast given me birth and through love and worship i shall inherit thy kingdom

1858525 but thanks be to god that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed and having been freed from sin you became slaves of righteousness
1858526 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom be the glory forevermore amen
1858527 he rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins
1858528 since then the children share in flesh and blood he himself christ likewise also partook of the same that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death that is the devil and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives
1858529 in love he predestined us to adoption as sons and daughters through jesus christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches in his grace which he lavished on us

1858645 loans for more than 417 000 just arent closing or arent closing as fast
1858646 that was it great pitching and timely hitting what can you say this team is the best team in baseball
1858647 when we get back to boston were going to party hard
1858648 if someone wants to compare us to the yankees based on winning and results thats an incredible standard
1858649 if they want to compare us to the yankees in how we do things thats a little off base
1858650 ive never hid the fact that i enjoy playing here in boston
1858651 i have great teammates a great manager great coaches so well see what happens
1858652 we were very frustrated a year ago because we didnt make it to the postseason
1858653 we all sat down and said were going to do what it takes and it started with signing matsuzaka and okajima and then bringing up ellsbury and pedroia
1858654 were a young team and our team performed not just the 10 and 15 million players but the young players too look at what jon lester went through jon lester is going to be with us for a long time
1858655 hes had to overcome some obstacles including not even pitching in a while and he did a great job
1858656 you watch the veterans act like little kids and then you see the young kids starting to act like veterans
1858657 to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses
1858658 does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1858659 i want you to have that girl if you dont have a boyfriend marry some trick with a big dick lets make tonight our victory party we are changing the world
1858660 hes so shockingly hot and hes straight oh my god hes like a unicorn
1858661 yes of course the fundamental right to marry part of the holding was extremely significant but the courts holding that sexual orientation is a suspect classification was stunning completely unprecedented i think it will forever change the legal landscape for lgbt people in the country its going to have a huge impact on courts in other states and ultimately on the federal courts we are now living in a different legal world because of what the court did
1858662 it was quite an extraordinary thing when alan uphold asked everyone whod been married to stand up i was stunned it literally puts it all in perspective i dont know how many people have come up to me and said weve been together 30 years 35 years 20 years its just extraordinary i just got married last week and i felt we were together a long time and its a year and a half i couldnt wait to get married i could only imagine couples that have been together for decades and the struggle and the despair and the resignation almost that you just never imagine it would happen in your life so theres not even the expectation that it could and now all thats changed and thats whats so important about november whats at stake is so much more palpable than we could have ever intellectualized it six months ago or even three months ago
1858663 ah come on that was as good as it gets the whole thing started with them in 2004 it was all about putting a human face on discrimination and no greater narrative no greater love story than theirs and to be able to do it then to go through the travail of the nullification and then to come back four years later i got to tell you candidly never thought i would have that opportunity in my life certainly not as mayor still and it was liberating it was glorious it was extraordinary and it wasnt just phil and del it was their family it was their friends and i understand this now better than ever because our wedding was about our families it wasnt just about jen and i and thats also something thats so important to communicate in the next few months that its not just about the lgbtq community this is about all of us this is about our families and friends this is about people coming together across their differences and thats something that i think is very unifying and so fundamental and i think thats a message we need to share so that we can get through november 4 successfully
1858664 no i dont so and if it is it is lets talk about healthcare education the environment lets talk about poverty and lets dispense with the idea that separate is somehow now equal i mean this with sincerity ive gotten more hardened on this i dont have much patience particularly for people in my party the democratic party that are arguing for separate institutions as somehow equal thats not audacity thats not authenticity thats not about conviction thats about accommodation and political posturing and im done with that and that may not be a political strategy thats a prudent one but i think its a little more principled and now more than ever we need a different direction and so im really proud of those democrats youve mentioned for standing on principle good for them and they did it early on and theyre successful candidates and isnt that the message every democrat in the legislature that not only once but twice voted for marriage equality they all got re elected and theyre doing fine and now i believe them a little bit more when they tell me what they think on other issues because they had the courage on this very difficult issue to stand on principle so it tells me something about them that allows me to be more open minded about them on other things
1858665 there are no words to describe how it feels to be standing before you tonight as a truly and fully equal californian its just so amazing to think that each and everyone of us in this room has lived to see the day when we are truly equal is overwhelming
1858666 i am very privileged to be alive doing this work in this moment people live their whole lives hoping to be in a time where they are a part of history being made and we are what a privilege to be able to have it be around issues of love and commitment and our relationships it doesnt get any better than this
1858667 del and phyllis made it possible for us to be here they did this work at a time when you lost everything being openly queer you lost jobs you lost children you lost your life certainly you lost the safety and security of society you lost your family and we really stand on their shoulders and i know they felt like they would never live to see a moment where they could actually legally marry so to be a part of bringing that moment to fruition and to be a part of their actually legal wedding was truly one of the highlights of my life other than perhaps my own wedding and when my children were born and it really did remind me of what it means to be in this movement this movement is not an end unto itself it really is about the place of lgbt people in this culture and we have taken a giant step forward and no the task is to maintain it and to never go back
1858668 i think we will defeat prop 8 i think there is every reason why we should defeat it but no one can be cavalier no one can be complacent no one can be sanguine about it it will take everything we have people will have to write the biggest checks theyve ever written devote more volunteer hours than they ever have have more difficult conversations than theyve ever had for 90 days for 90 days we have to give it everything and if we do we will beat this thing
1858669 we understand that whats at stake on november 4 and what we won on may 15th of this year so transcends the ability to marry it really is about common dignity and humanity and yes young people waking up feeling like they see themselves reflected in this culture instead of the toxic atmosphere so many of us were subjected to as we grew up for me to be able to marry the person most precious to me in the world sandy holmes is what this is all about
1858670 harvey milk stands in for every lesbian and gay bisexual and transgender person who sacrificed everything they lost kids they lost jobs lost their family they lost their religions they lost their neighborhood they lost their community they lost their dignity they lost their lives they did not make it to this moment what we owe them because we did is that we will not waste it we know this is the moment we know how we got here and a big part of how we got here is on their backs and we are going to make damn sure were not going back
1858671 and then we had a debate about that word marriage whats in a word if we just do domestic partners it not the same well make it the same well give all the rights and responsibilities of marriage but well call it something else we just wont call it marriage we actually had that very spirited debate and we decided introduce not only the bill on domestic partnerships but a pilot bill a spot bill about marriage to get the discussion going words can be very powerful we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and woman are created equal powerful powerful words and yet if you think about our history there were times when people had a similar debate theres a swimming poll for black people and swimming pool for white people and everybody gets to swim one way or the other so its separate but its equal and there are drinking fountains and rest rooms over here for colored people and drinking fountains over there for white people and here in los angeles there were drinking fountains for mexicans and in san francisco there were drinking fountains for chinese but everybody got to drink water and it was separate but equal but eventually that couldnt stand up against the words we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal and they tumbled so as gay and lesbian people could we really have sat with domestic partnership or would we have reached the same conclusion that that flew in the face of those words in the documents of our founding mothers and fathers thomas jefferson eternal vigilance is the price of liberty youve got your freedom to marry youve got your liberty eternal vigilance is what its going to take to keep it and sometimes i wake up and think after all weve been through fighting the briggs initiative in 78 so gay teachers could stay in the classroom three aids initiative in the 1980s that would have quarantined hiv positive people fighting the us military fighting the white house fighting the congress fighting in 49 capitols do we really have to fight for this one word marriage havent we suffered enough thats a catholic and jewish thing and theres another saying about suffering
1858672 uhw is absolutely involved in fighting prop 8 we have 22 offices around the state 400 staff 150 000 members and its an absolute priority its a fundamental civil rights issue from our point of view but bigger than that were part of seiu and were challenging our national union in washington dc to match their 500 000 contribution and one step up from that two weeks ago the california labor federation convention and this is historic because it was without dissent voted to join this campaign so were going to do an educational campaign with 2 million union members and their families throughout the state about this fundamental civil rights issue
1858673 i got married 7 days ago so this is very fresh in my mind whats at stake this november and what weve tried to do for decades for a lifetime its an extraordinary gift to be a participant
1858674 theyd been together for 15 years and one of them literally has weeks to live she was in a wheelchair and she had a breathing apparatus and she could barely speak and she was on all kinds of medications so much so she could barely put her ring on they had to place it around her neck and at the end of the ceremony one i conducted it took about 20 minutes because i had to stop so many times because i could barely get through it and at the end her father comes up to me and he is of japanese descent and he said i never thought that this would happen and i said i appreciate that thank you for being here this is an extraordinary gift to be able to share with your daughter this moment and he says no no for another reason and he started to tell me about his life story and his mothers journey from japan and his father from south dakota and how they were denied the ability to get married and here he was having all his life never having had that capacity to celebrate something so many of us take for granted and he thought he would lose that opportunity with his daughter and here he was a bookend of history in 1967 16 states denied interracial marriage on the basis of someones skin color it was said you cant get married and here was his daughter who was denied the same except for that extraordinary moment the time were experiencing today and i was reflecting on that to jen the one thing im starting to understand now more than ever is you cannot force love upon someone else and when you find it its something to celebrate its something to embrace something to cherish thats what its all about its about love its about life its about all of us as human beings its about human dignity its about self worth its about the capacity to see and receive things that for so many generations folks have simply taken for granted when kate comes out and says what an extraordinary thing we did in 2004 and she said i did the right thing what does that say that in this day and age its an extraordinary thing for someone to do the right thing when i listen to geoff eloquently explain some of the history of those that believe its too much too soon too fast separate but not equal that history to be honest with you i dont buy it anymore it just doesnt work anymore but this is a moment in time this is it and im learning this millions of people around the world are counting on you this is a big deal not just for folks living out in california or for that matter across this country but around he world i was stunned when someone told me the king of cambodia was watching cnn and started seeing images of gay couples getting married and did and then later to find out that one of the reasons beyond the images is that he now realized he could because someone else somewhere else is doing it thats the quality of imagination the expectation that we could be so much more and do so much more and thats whats at stake its the capacity for people to believe its so fundamental but its so profoundly important because it transcends this issue if we can do this in our lifetimes if we can succeed in this effort imagine what else were capable of doing
1858675 im hopeful about the defeat of prop 8 but at the same time im nervous the same way im nervous about democratic presidential candidate barack obama im hopeful about obama but im nervous i feel like the country is so strange right now and i feel that nothing is for certain so you cannot stop fighting we should continue the battle right till the very end with everything we possibly can the slim difference between obama and republican rival john mccain in the polls shows the racism in this country theres no way with what obama has accomplished so far and how mccain has faltered and the republicans dont even like him the fact that its so close it has to be that a lot of white males will not vote for a black candidate so i think its about racism but its terrifying ive read so much that shows that this next four years is going to determine everything for the rest of our lives and if mccain gets elected and it becomes four more years of george bush i just dont even know what to do i feel like i want to move to canada heres our chance to do something new and fresh and change the world and if that doesnt happen the ramifications of that are beyond belief
1858676 whoever thought we would ever have that opportunity for us family is everything weve done a lot in our families to come out with our families to bringing our families together they love us they embrace us so our wedding will be just with our immediate family and well have a very special day with our son our on going joke is that were making honest men of our sons fathers it means the world for us to be able to have our civil rights with a spiritual connection to be able to have our relationship honored in a way that we honor it i dont need anyone to put a stamp of approval on it but the fact that we can stand up and say hey were here were californians and we have the same rights as our heterosexual fellows is something that i think is really really important so it means the world to us actually

1858719 it astounds me its so counter intuitive but have we forgotten the events of that horrible day have we grown tired of the aftermath if so shame on us when the first fatality came it barely caused a whimper in the media but i was touched deeply
1858720 i grew up in the time of the kennedys and i was really struck by two things they said president kennedy said ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country bobby said some men see things as they are and say why i dream of things that never were and say why not i met people healthy people in their 40s and 50s who cant walk up stairs anymore who have to decide whether to spend the money they have on medicine or food but sometimes not both if i didnt do something to help this issue then i wasnt the man i thought i was
1858721 this country needs to be reminded of the suffering of these heroes and weve got to urge those in government to not forget them

1858737 technology imposes structure on our actions which gives us a tenuous handle on uncertainty
1858738 technology is intrinsically statistical and that means that it cannot deal with the singularities that emerge spontaneously when it merges with human systems
1858739 only neurotics think they can use technology to control the real world
1858740 the biggest challenge i faced in organizing information is what to include and what to leave out as well as remembering to make note of the specific times things happen

1858744 fear about the disease has intensified among the warao while a preventative response is needed now
1858745 we traveled by bus 16 hours to caracas to make the authorities aware of the situation with the hope of getting some response
1858746 and we are met with disrespect on every level as if the deaths of indigenous people are not even worth noting
1858747 all we request is for authorities to respond to this disease as they would if it occurred in a rich district of caracas
1858748 i think like i tend to do which takes some of the power away and minimizes the message
1858749 the feedback from season ticket holders they all liked marcus and understood what he meant to the community and the team but they simply dont want to return to the same team with the same results weve been having
1858750 if this ad leaves a bad taste in your mouth please give a thought to what sensitive animals think and feel when they come to the end of their frightening journey and see hear and smell the slaughterhouse
1858751 like human victims animals in slaughterhouses experience terror when they are attacked by a knife wielding assailant
1858752 we are challenging everyone who is rightly horrified by this crime to look into their hearts and consider leaving violence off their dinner plates
1858753 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can

1858756 it turns our whole framework of choice on its head
1858757 how is it going to increase jobs and air service in minnesota how are they going to compete and survive in an industry in turmoil what guarantees do they make performance guarantees
1858758 we dont get dollar one until the first day of travel
1858759 i think you might be leaving some money on the table
1858760 his selection is a statement to how moving his story is
1858761 the fact that he survived these tragedies is an amazing story
1858762 i really hope the international olympic committee will make all efforts to protect competing athletes and their right to be able to speak about this or any issue they consider to be relevant
1858763 but thats between this government and joey as a private citizen trying to make his way to these games
1858764 the most exciting day ever in my life the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
1858765 they were a little bit overly cautious when they went through the airport those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1858766 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation
1858767 weve got so many guys that can do so many things and weve got a leadoff guy who happens to be a four hitter who also steals bases
1858768 weve got a lineup full of patient hitters in which everyone knows their roles mixed in with three superstars
1858769 we dont have anyone with 30 homers or 90 rbi but weve got a whole lot of guys that can hurt you
1858770 anything that was falling off the plate they didnt swing at and anything that was up in the zone or over the plate they pretty much hit
1858771 its the biggest roller coaster you could ever imagine the highs are great and the lows are really low and thats basically on a weekly and daily basis
1858772 waiting for the results to come back youre biting your nails down to the skin
1858773 nobody can realize except those who have gone through it what it does to your psyche
1858774 and in erics case i think that comfortable place is back in the water
1858775 his spirits are extremely high hes way way excited this has all worked out and he can swim in the olympics
1858776 he thought it was 100 there was no way he was going to the olympics
1858777 the doctors said we can give you time for the trials but we dont think theres any way the surgery can be postponed until after the olympics
1858778 hes hanging in there he has been responding very well to the treatments
1858779 its one of those things that we can relate to each other on no father and son wants to have that but i understand a lot more now and a lot better what he has been going through
1858780 it was kind of surreal you cant believe this is happening
1858781 its one of those defining moments in my life i just have to make sure its a positive defining moment
1858782 i dont want to call it the worst day in my life right now and from some people i talk to maybe itll be the best day of my life in 10 years because itll help define me as a person
1858783 it gives you a better sense of the bigger picture
1858784 the olympics looks a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
1858785 you almost forget he has it because he doesnt act like he has it
1858786 it stuck in his craw for four years that he just missed making the olympic team in 04 he spent four years focusing on it he didnt want to let anything interfere with that goal
1858787 ironically the swim i actually made the team in wasnt necessarily a great swim for me
1858788 to be honest it wasnt a real smart swim i know i can be a lot faster at the games
1858789 the field is very very deep the 200 breaststroke has gotten a lot faster over the past four months a lot of people have dropped a lot of time
1858790 but i give myself a better chance than most to get on that podium because i know im perfectly capable of getting up there in the top three
1858791 id be shocked if hes not in the 2 08s 2 09s at the olympics he has that in him if he swims the right race
1858792 i try to keep swimming separate from the medical stuff as much as i can i dont want to bring that stuff to the pool
1858793 at the same time swimming is how i kind of escape from it at this point swimming is kind of like a vacation for me i dont think about the cancer when im in there practicing
1858794 when you get to an event like the olympic games you can put too much pressure on yourself ive kind of got an out in cancer it keeps things in perspective for me theres a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1858795 hes an over worker he always works harder than you want more often than you want and hes doing the same thing
1858796 when he walked through the door for a swim meet or practice he has always been able to leave all that baggage outside
1858797 i have to listen to certain people but in the end as long as im happy with myself thats all that matters
1858798 you just kind of take ownership of it ok this is the card ive been dealt
1858799 you know what you look like to me with your good bag and your bad shoes you look like a rube
1858800 im just drilling holes the next two weeks fuck it

1858814 where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds is he not the carpenters son is not his mother named mary and his brothers james joseph simon and judas are not his sisters all with us where did this man get all this
1858815 a prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house
1858816 is he not the carpenters son and he did not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith
1858817 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water

1858827 because we were doing it toether but did you stop no you kep doing it over and over again even in front of me and you know what i thought brenna your girlfriend your most prized posetion could get you to stop but no you broke up because she found heroin in your pocket and you dried to her like a little baby saying
1858828 with pencil because on the other side theres an eraser
1858829 and no matter what you do you can always go up or down
1858830 thats what fall camp is for evaluation and really getting the guys ready i think once this week is done going into the second week well really start solidifying some spots
1858831 peppered with new guys and inexperience at the beginning of practice one guy will look great and at the end of practice another guy will look great
1858832 yesterday royce pollard and daniel lofton practiced at wideout with the second unit neither has game experience with pollard redshirting last season and lofton sitting out the year after transferring from california
1858833 im just trying to get used to everything trying to get comfortable with the routes
1858834 our offense is tough we rely a lot on our receivers so we have to do a lot of different adjustments and we have to read a lot of coverages so thats probably a big challenge as far as knowing where to run and what looks youre going to get in the game
1858835 in the beginning of the season i wasnt too intense because i was still learning the plays i was just going off a lot of what hawthorne and rivers were doing and i was trying to mimic them because i know they did really good
1858836 im still pushing to travel because theres a lot of competition out there and coach tells us every day that the spots are open so i always look at that as something to keep working on because i dont ever want to think im solid in a spot
1858837 go out and do the best i can do because people are going to find stuff to critique and when you have that name you almost get criticized way more people have big expectations
1858838 his fathers influence did have an impact on his decision to come to hawaii the loftons lived in hawaii and james lofton is friends with former uh coach june jones having that familiarity with the warriors and being a fan of the offense made it seem like the perfect fit although the timing was a bit off lofton attended cals fall camp in 2007 and made the switch to hawaii the week of the season opener against northern colorado
1858839 i just felt like this was the place for me to be ive kind of waited out two years i just want the opportunity to play
1858840 with this you keep them fresh and you have a little more confidence in your depth
1858841 before if you were the fifth or sixth guy you were never going to see the field now if you perform youll get on the field somehow
1858842 my friends they knew we were a passing team and they were asking why arent they giving you the rock
1858843 im the happiest guy in the world all this talk about runnin the rock im loving it
1858844 it seemed like every time i turned around he was running down the football field so i think hes pretty dang good i think leon is the real deal and we need to give him some carries
1858845 coach mac told me to get prepared for this season hes a firm believer in the balanced attack and has big plans for the offense this season he has been encouraging me telling me to get ready and be prepared for it
1858846 the ball kind of led me that way and i got a little scared i didnt want to hurt him i caught the ball and he was right there
1858847 i was playing too up at the free safety im going to have to deepen a little bit
1858848 little things are really important where they point their toes what their key is where their hands are you have to get the repetitions and then you do it naturally
1858849 he is so organized he has everything in writing exactly what he wants you to do he even says if he sees a mistake on film first he looks at himself then the coordinators and the position coaches and then he looks at the player he puts a lot of pressure on himself in being real organized and being real specific with what he wants us to do
1858850 as a football player ill play anywhere the coaches need me the punt teams an important facet of the game so any players we need on that team no matter where you are on the depth chart offense or defense if we need you on the team youve got to play
1858851 i can do whatever it takes to help the team win no problem with that my last time at back all we would do is block here block there we were basically a lineman but 150 pounds lighter now we have more mental input into the system a chance to think on our toes very quickly as if we are a receiver good deal
1858852 second year freshman wideout royce pollard made two impressive grabs on back to back reps yesterday on the first he tripped at the start of his route and was nearly flat on his back but somehow managed to spring himself up off the grass horizontally in an instant when qb inoke funaki fired the ball his way
1858853 thats something i need to work on i was just rushing and fell when i saw the ball i was just urgent and worked as hard as i could to get it
1858854 on his next sequence he twisted behind and got a hand on the ball up the middle then spun around to complete the catch on his back both earned cheers from his teammates
1858855 yesterday greg salas aaron bain mike washington and malcolm lane lined up from left to right in the first group during offensive team drills bell left wideout henry left slot and tinoco right wideout have taken second and third string positions thus far
1858856 the first few days of practice for the new guys are the toughest because they gotta learn the plays they gotta get the timing down with the quarterbacks and then on top of that they gotta catch the ball theres a lot of different factors that come into that getting off the line of scrimmage running the route properly recognizing the coverage youll see a lot of dropped balls in the first few days of course you dont condone it but the thing you really look for in the first couple of days is the effort
1858857 i just want to showcase my football smarts my iq route running and what i can do after i catch the ball
1858858 it was a bit different but its always good to get out here and compete with the team and everything i felt real good about it help the team out wherever i can try to get as many reps as the coaches allow me to
1858859 i knew all the plays when i went out there knew what i had to do every route knew where to be how to run it had no questions thats why summer helped out a lot
1858860 were looking at him to stretch the field his disadvantage is he wasnt able to come out during the summertime so its really going to be how much can he learn in the next two or three weeks leading up to florida
1858861 i feel like theyre doing all the right things working hard mikes always looking to get in craigs the same way ryans out there doing his thing and theyre all learning theyre all doing good i feel
1858862 los sue os nos permiten ver lo invisible creer lo increible y lograr lo imposible
1858863 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1858864 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1858865 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
1858866 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
1858867 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
1858868 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
1858869 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
1858870 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
1858871 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
1858872 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
1858873 her supporters want after 18 million votes and the record of success from march 1 through june 1 to feel recognized and i think we should
1858874 we will have this in hand for sen clinton should this be needed
1858875 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium
1858876 hillary delegates feel like were not welcome needed or valued
1858877 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
1858878 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
1858879 and thats what we want people to feel we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid
1858880 sen clinton will play a critical role in this convention and is also playing a critical role in the campaign
1858881 she has campaigned for obama raised money for him and spoken on his behalf on several occasions we appreciate and look forward to her continued support

1858886 askwiki often grabs data from infoboxes there are thousands of infobox types many of which are misused for example it would be great for all actor pages to use the infobox actor template instead of the generic infobox person or biography also some cities have a standard infobox city some others have settlement some have an external page included infobox switching all these items to a standard infobox would improve the accuracy of askwiki
1858887 there are five primary things you can do with freebase 1 browse and read information 2 edit existing data 3 upload new data sets 4 build applications that use freebase data 5 suggest and create schemas for new data

1859001 jiwa kita ditolong oleh saudara kecil ini tapi urusanmu masih belum dapat diselesaikan kelima kakak seperguruanku masih terus mencari cari kau dan kalau bertemu dengan mereka kau bisa celaka apakah kau suka mengikut aku pergi ke koen loen san
1859002 kita berdua menemui guruku dan memberitahukan bahwa kau tidak mencuri ilmu pdang liung heng it pit kiam sejuruspun kau tidak mampu dalam urusan ini sebegitu lama guruku belum menyudahi jiwamu selalu masih berada dalam bahaya
1859003 secara kebetulan aku hanya melihat gurumu bersilat untuk sekejap mata tapi untuk kesalahan yang sebenarnya bukan kesalahan hampir hampir jiwaku melayang ah benar benar keterlaluan
1859004 cobalah kau pikir kesukaran siauw moay dalam hal ini kalau kau saja yang memberitahukan soehoe pasti tak percaya dan siauw moay akan mendapat hukuman siauw moay dihukum tak menjadi soal tapi jika kelima saudara seperguruanku sampai salah tangan dan mencelakakanmu siauw moay tentu akan merasa tidak enak sekali
1859005 begini saja sekarang kau ikut aku ke kun lun san sesudah itu jika kau mempunyai urusan penting yang harus diselesaikan siauw moay akan menemani kau untuk membereskannya bagaimana pikiranmu
1859006 saudara kecil mari kita ke koen loen san beramai ramai di jalan kita takkan merasa kesepian

1859008 aku sendiri tak tahu di mana letak coe bong heng tapi kita bisa menyelidiki perlahan lahan dan aku merasa pasti kita akan dapat menemukannya
1859009 dia sengaja datang kemari untuk meminta ampun dia mengatakan bahwa dia seorang tolol dan secara tidak sengaja dia sudah menonton waktu soehoe berlatih tapi dia kata kiamhoat kita sangat tinggi sehingga meskipun sudah melihatnya dia tidak mendapat keuntungan jua dan setengah juruspun tak dapat menirunya
1859010 bagus kau telah bekerja baik sekali penjarakan orang she souw itu dalam kamar batu di gunung belakang aku akan menjatuhkan hukuman belakangan
1859011 apa para soebo baik aku ingin pergi ke belakang untuk memberi hormat
1859012 memang ada baiknya jika kau pergi menemui ngo kouw dia sakit berat untung kau pulang siang siang sehingga masih keburu bertemu muka dengannya
1859013 sudah tujuh tabib yang terkenal pandai diundang olehku tapi tak satupun yang tahu dia sakit apa
1859014 aku mempunyai begitu banyak murid tapi tak satupun yang berguna aku memerintah mereka pergi ke gunung tiang pekpsan untuk mencari loo san jie som tetapi sesudah pergi dua bulan seorangpun belum pulang aku menyuruh mereka pergi mencari soat lian sie ouw dan lain lain obat penolong jiwa semua kembali dengan tangan kosong
1859015 dengan menggunakan lweekang aku telah memeriksa pembuluh darahnya tapi sedikitpun aku tidak menemui sesuatu yang luar biasa katanya
1859016 huh huh kalau jiwa ngo kouw tidak tertolong aku akan mampuskan semua tabib goblok dalam dunia ini
1859017 dari holam teecoe membawa seorang tabib yang biarpun usianya masih muda kepandaiannya banyak lebih tinggi daripada tabib tabib itu
1859018 waktu teecoe kena racun bunga to lo hijau saudara kecil inilah yang mengobati teecoe
1859019 penyakit itu masih dapat diobati tapi aku tak sudi mengobatinya
1859020 kalau kau bisa menolong ngo kouw segenap anggota koen loen pay dari atas sampai di bawah akan merasa sangat berterima kasih saudara thio tolonglah
1859021 dia thie kim sianseng turut mengambil pada bagian waktu sejumlah manusia kejam memaksa kedua orang tuaku membunuh diri perlu apa aku menolong jiwa gundiknya
1859022 saudara thio pada waktu ayahmu masih hidup aku bersahabat baik dengannya bahwa ia telah membunuh diri sudah sangat mendukakan hatiku
1859023 setelah kedua orang tuamu meninggal dunia beberapa kali soehoe menangis
1859024 beliau sering mengatakan bahwa mendiang ayahmu adalah sahabatnya yang paling akrab
1859025 hoe jin nyonya bukan mendapat penyakit aneh ia kena racun dari kim gin hiat
1859026 aku pun belum pernah melihat ular itu aku menarik kesimpulan itu karena muka hoejin lihatlah apa di ujung jari kaki terdapat luka gigitan yang sangat kecil
1859027 setiap ujung jari kakinya benar terluka saudara kecil kau sungguh pandai sesudah mengetahui sebab musebab penyakit itu saudara kecil pasti dapat menyembuhkannya sesudah dia sembuh aku akan memberi hadiah yang besar
1859028 penyakit hoejin memang luar biasa dan kita tak dapat menyalahkan mereka
1859029 sesudah saudara kecil berada di sini memang perlu apa tabib tabib goblok itu berdiam lebih lama lagi coen jin berikan seratus tail perak kepada setiap orang dan suruh mereka pergi segera
1859030 di bawah kaki ranjang terdapat dua lubang kecil dan lubang itu adalah tempat keluar masuknya ular kim gin hiat
1859031 racun yang mengeram di dalam badan hoejin harus dipunahkan oleh ular itu juga kalau kau bunuh hoejin tak dapat disembuhkan lagi
1859032 penyakit hoejin karena gara gara delapan pot bunga anggrek leng cie lan itu
1859033 karna tahu aku suka menanam bunga seorang sahabat yang datang dari wilayah barat see hek dan yang membawa delapan pot bunga itu sudah menghadiahkannya kepada aku bunga itu sangat indah dan harum hm aku tak tahu dia bibit penyakit
1859034 menurut katanya kitab ilmu ketabiban leng cie lan berubi yang bentuknya bundar seperti bola warnanya merah api dan di dalam ubi itu terdapat racun yang sangat hebat
1859035 sekarang aku minta kalian menggali semua pohon anggrek itu dan taruh ubinya dalam sebuah mangkok kayu
1859036 tambahkan delapan biji telur ayam dan semangkok darah ayam pukul campuran itu sampai menjadi hancur tapi yang mengerjakannya harus berhati hati harus menjaga sampai campuran itu tidak mengenai kulit
1859037 kalau sebentar terjadi kejadian luar biasa kuharap kalian jangan bersuara supaya ular itu tidak menjadi kaget dan menggigit kalian harap kalian menutup hidung dengan kapas

1859043 from a teachers perspective a survey from a publisher is not how curriculum gets developed curriculum is developed within a school community as it focuses on mission and then decides what and how to teach text books are tools to accomplish curricula goals but texts are not synonymous with curriculum
1859044 geography and history are my subjects secular material gets pretty sketchy in geography because it is so hung up on an evolutionary viewpoint some of my history curriculum on the other hand has a heavy fundamentalist baptist bias for example one of columbus flaws was that he was a catholic according to my teacher manual so was everybody else in western europe during columbus lifetime

1859091 we see touch as the almost preferred method for nontechnical users
1859092 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
1859093 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years
1859094 currently these gestures require the same touch sensing technology used in the iphone but they use a traditional looking trackpad
1859095 eventually we expect apple to change the trackpad to backlit color screens for a more dynamic user interface on the mac
1859096 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1859097 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it

1859117 i get tired of how hard it is anything is possible if you put your heart in it you put your soul into and believe it can happen
1859118 this is an unprecedented situation at least in my opinion i was in oakland when we got jerry rice that was similar to this from the standpoint hes probably the best receiver to ever play

1859124 pro evolution soccer has always been the game of choice for soccer enthusiasts due to its ultra realism and superior gameplay and there is no player in the world more suited to be on the box than the talented forward from barcelona lionel messi
1859125 lionel is one of the most exciting and accomplished players in the world and we look forward to working very closely with him to promote the most advanced

1859196 saudara yok keponakanku telah melihat putrimu demikian lihai ia jadi sangat jatuh hati inilah sebabnya kenapa sekarang kami datang kemari dengan tidak memperdulikan jalan jauh ribuan lie untuk meminangnya
1859197 saudara cit kami paman dan keponakan mengagumi orang orang tho hoa to kenapa kau sebaliknya lain pandanganmu kenapa kau berlaku sungguh sungguh sama segala bocah coba bukannya keponakanku itu panjang umurnya pastilah siang siang dia telah mati di bawah hujan jarum emas yang menjadi kepandaianmu yang istimewa
1859198 sebenarnya cit kong yang menolongi keponakanmu itu kenapa sekarang kau bicara begini rupa
1859199 yong jie kau beberlah urusannya auwyang kongcu merampas nona thia supaya ayahmu mendapat tahu
1859200 dulu hari itu di dalam istana chao wang kau mengadu kepandaian dengan aku dengan sengaja kau menelikung kebelakang kedua tanganmu kau bilang bahwa tanpa menggunai tangan kau bisa mengalahkan benar bukan
1859201 kemudian aku telah mengangkat lojinkee ang cit kong menjadi guruku
1859202 lalu di poo eng kita mengadu silat untuk kedua kalinya itu waktu kau menyebutnya aku boleh menggunakan kepandaian yang diwariskan ayahku atau ang cit kong kau bilang aku boleh keluarkan berapa banyak juga sebaliknya kau sendiri kau cuma akan menggunakan semacam ilmu kepandaian warisan pamanmu dengan apa kau sanggup mengalahkan aku benar tidak
1859203 bukankah itu hari kita telah menetapkannya demikian baru kita bertempur
1859204 dia tidak memandang mata kepada cit kong dia juga tidak menghormati padamu dia mau bilang cit kong dan ayah berdua kalah jauh dengan pamannya itu bukankah itu berarti meski cit kong dan ayah berdua mengepung pamannya pamannya itu masih tak dapat dikalahkan tapi ini aku tidak percaya
1859205 diantara kaum persilatan di kolong langit ini siapakah yang tidak kenal baik ilmu silatnya tong shia see tok lam tee dan pak kay
1859206 saudara cit kau datang berkunjung ke tho hoa to ada urusan apakah
1859207 persahabatan kita adalah persahabatan dari beberapa puluh tahun saudara cit maka itu kalau ada titah dari kau mana aku berani tidak menurutinya
1859208 kalau urusan gampang tidak nanti saudara cit sampai memikir untuk meminta bantuanku
1859209 kau barulah saudara yang sejati jadi kau pasti menerima baik
1859210 perlu kita menanya dulu saudara cit urusan itu sebenarnya urusan apa
1859211 racun tua bangka inilah urusan tidak ada sangkut pautnya dengan kau jangan kau ikut campur lebih baik kau sedia sedia dengan ususmu yang kosong untuk nanti kau menenggak arak kegirangan
1859212 mereka berdua adalah murid muridku aku telah berikan janji kepada mereka untuk memohon kepada saudara yok agar mereka dibiarkan menikah satu pada lain dan sekarang saudara yok sudah menerima baik permohonanku itu
1859213 putrinya saudara yok sudah dijodohkan dengan keponakanku dan hari ini aku datang ke tho hoa to ini untuk mengambil ketetapannya
1859214 kau menjodohkan seorang putrimu kepada dua keluarga apakah artinya ini
1859215 akulah orang perantaraan dari keluarga kwee kau sendiri mana orang perantaanmu
1859216 suadara yok sudah menerima baik aku pun sudah akur maka itu perlu apa lagi orang perantaan
1859217 apakah kau ketahui masih ada satu orang yang tidak menerima baik
1859218 keponakanmu itu tidak bagus kelakuannya mana dia cocok untuk dijodohkan dengan putri yang cantik manis dari saudara yok ini umpama kata benar kamu berdua memaksa mereka menikah habis bagaimana kalau mereka sendiri tidak akur setiap hari mereka berkelahi saja apakah artinya itu
1859219 keponakanmu terluka baik kau obati dulu padanya urusan nanti kita damaikan pula
1859220 anakku bertubuh lemah dan nakal sebenarnya sulit untuk dia merawati seorang budiman maka adalah diluar dugaanku saudara cit dan saudara hong telah memandang mukaku dan sama sama melamarnya hal ini adalah suatu kehormatan untukku sebenarnya anakku ini sudah dijodohkan dengan pihak auwyang tetapi sekarang ada titahnya saudara cit sukar aku tolak kejadian ini menyulitkan aku sekarang aku pikir baik diatur begini saja coba kedua saudara lihat pemecahan ini dapat dilakukan atau tidak
1859221 aku si pengemis tua paling tidak suka omong pakai segala aturan
1859222 sebenarnya anakku tidak mengerti segala apa akan tetapi meskipun demikian aku masih mengharap dia nanti menikah dengan seorang suami yang baik baik auwyang sieheng ada keponakannya saudara hong dan kwee sieheng ada murid pandai dari saudara cit kedua duanya baik sukar untuk aku memilihnya tidak dapat aku membuang salah satunya karena itu aku pikir baiklah mereka diuji saja di sini aku ada mempunyai tiga macam syarat pendeknya siapa yang lulus anakku akan dijodohkan dengannya tidak nanti aku berlaku berat sebelah bagaimana sahabat sahabatku
1859223 cuma sekarang keponakanku sedang terluka kalau buat adu silat aku minta supaya itu ditunda sampai ia sudah sembuh
1859224 kau si oey tersesat kau banyak akalnya jikalau kau majukan ilmu surat syair atau nyanyi tentulah muridku yang tolol gagal kau bilang kau tidak mau berat sebelah sebenarnya pikiranmu sudah lain maka tidak ada lain jalan baiklah aku ambil caraku
1859225 kita semua tukang silat kalau kita tidak adu silat apa kita mesti adu main gembul gembulan keponakanmu terluka kau sendiri tidak marilah mari kita berdua yang main main lebih dulu
1859226 aku berdiam di tho hoa to ini dengan melatih diri sungguh sungguh aku percaya setelah ong tiong yang meninggal dunia aku bakal jadi orang gagah nomor satu di kolong langit ini siapa tahu sekarang si pengemis tua bangka ini dan si biang racun tua telah mengambil jalannya masing masing yang hebat sekali
1859227 dia masih sangat muda mana dia ketahui kepandaian istimewa dari pamanku ini
1859228 kau toh bukannya dia mana kau ketahui dia mengerti atau tidak
1859229 baru belasan hari aku tidak lihat dia mungkinkah dia telah dapat pelajaran silat dari malaikat
1859230 benarkah dia memperoleh kemajuan begini pesat kenapa ia agaknya girang sekali
1859231 inilah semacam ilmu silat yang lihai sekali namanya ilmu kodok
1859232 kau menggaruki gatal dipunggungku bukankah banyak banyak terima kasih nah ini aku kembalikan garukanmu
1859233 kedua pamanmu lagi berlatih silat di sini kenapa kau main gila budak
1859234 kee mo kang dari auwyang pepe hebat luar biasa jikalau bukannya dia menaruh belas kasihan kepadamu apakah kau kira sekarang kau masih mempunyai jiwamu coba kau lihat paseban itu
1859235 benar benar lihai ini pengemis bangkotan dia berhasil mengajari muridnya ilmu yang begini sempura
1859236 ini bocah tidak tahu tingginya langit tebalnya bumi dia berani melayani auwyang hong tidak memandang aku tidakkah urat urat dan tulang tulangnya bakal putus dan remuk
1859237 bocah ini jujur dan baik hatinya walaupun tidak dapat aku nikahkan anakku kepadanya mesti menghadiahkan sesuatu kepadanya
1859238 kita berdua belum ada yang kalah dan menang mari kita bertempur pula
1859239 kamu berdua sudah bertarung lebih daripada seribu jurus kamu tetap belum memutuskan menang atau kalah karena hari ini kamu berdua adalah tetamu tetamu terhormat dari tho hoa to lebih baik kamu berdua duduk minum beberapa cawan arak pilihan yang aku nanti menyediakannya saatnya merundingkan pedang di hoa san akan tiba di depan mata maka itu wkatu bukan cuma kamu berdua yang bakal mengadu kepandaian pula juga aku dan toan hong ya akan bersama turun tangan bagaimana jikalau pertempuran ini hari disudahi sampai disini
1859240 si makhluk berbisa bangkotan dari wilayah barat lain mulutnya lain hatinya
1859241 kau memang sudah sangat tersohor kau membilang bakal kalah itu artinya kau bakal menang tidak aku si pengemis tua tidak dapat mempercayainya
1859242 nyatalah kamu berdua hari ini datang ke thoa hoa to untuk mempertunjukkan kepandaian kamu
1859243 sebenarnya kami datang kemari untuk mengajukan lamaranku bukannya untuk mengadu kepandaian
1859244 bukankah aku telah mengatakan hendak aku mengajukan tiga syarat untuk menguji kedua sieheng
1859245 siapa yang lulus dialah yang aku akan ambil sebagai menantuku dan siapa yang jatuh dia pun tidak bakal aku membuatnya pulang kecewa
1859246 umpama kata aku lekas lekas menikah pula dan mendapatkan satu anak perempuan sekarang ini sudah tidak keburu lagi aku ini mengerti juga kasar kasar tentang ilmu pengobatan dan meramalkan maka itu sieheng yang mana yang tidak lulus jikalau ia tidak mencelanya dan sudi mempelajari dia boleh memilih pelajaran yang mana ia penuju nanti aku mengajarinya dengan sungguh sungguh

1859289 its a battle for people living on a full aged pension theyve got very little super
1859290 even with the 15 per cent contributions which paul keating advocates the majority of australians who are currently retired have very little or no super they werent in the system long enough they didnt accrue enough
1859291 thats why the issue of the aged pension is just as important as superannuation contributions there is a significant group in the community who would face a real battle in retirement
1859292 unfortunately the previous howard costello government abandoned that and i think that was a big mistake because it would have lifted the retirement savings
1859293 so all of those issues plus the intersection with the superannuation system are very much under the microscope through this review
1859294 we are ambitious for the future of superannuation but we cant do anything unless we do it within a responsible fiscal envelope
1859295 and at the moment we have judged that we need to look at all the issues to deal with superannuation and its intersection with the transfer payments system and thats why were look at the review i completely reject the notion that the government is doing nothing in this area
1859296 this government like the last one is doing nothing about taking super to 15 per cent not even to 12

1859326 you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control

1859328 most americans identify the surge as taking resources and putting them where theyre needed for success

1859592 but how can anyone know whether a reputed implant is real or not how some ufo investigators have begun to wonder can they authenticate an implant should a sample emerge
1859593 one person addressing this issue is david pritchard a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology according to pritchard no matter how strange the structure or material of an alleged implant if it is not some out of this world material like heavy metals or quark matter it wont be possible to convince a lot of people but pritchard adds there are other ways to skin the cat for example researchers could peg an insert as such if it worked like a flashlight but was a hundred times brighter than any flashlight on earth if the implant sent complex but unrecognizable signals he says that would be pretty convincing as well finally pritchard believes evidence would mount if investigators found the exact same type of implant in numerous people making abduction claims
1859594 the technique mri magnetic resonance imaging was tapped by reputed abductee whitley strieber who says he remembers the insertion of needles in his head his mri brain scans he adds now show strange white spots are the unknown objects in my brain an outcome of such intrusions strieber asked in his recent book transformation pritchard says the dots prove nothing they could be air bubbles but a statistical argument could be made he adds if researchers can show that professed ufo abductees have significantly more dots than a random control group
1859595 one out of every fifty adult american may have had ufo abduction experiences
1859596 many of the presenting symptoms offered by these patients alleged abductees can only be satisfacorily explained by assuming that their abduction recollections have an objective reality

1859618 our finding of lower occurrences of asthma in children of mothers who received supplements of marine omega 3 fatty acids in pregnancy is in line with 2 retrospective and 3 prospective studies it is biologically plausible that increasing the intake of marine omega 3 pufas in the third trimester of pregnancy could have a preventive effect against asthma in the offspring the marine omega 3 pufas epa and dha may affect fetal immune function through many different mechanisms
1859619 in this study we sought to determine whether supplementation with cynara cardunculus wild artichoke or its main identified constituents namely luteolin 7 glycoside apigenin and caffeic acid modulates metalloproteinase 9 expression and activity in cell culture
1859620 in summary our results show that cynara cardunculus a wild plant traditionally part of the mediterranean diet is a powerful inhibitor of metalloproteinase 9 by interfering with its transcription and production the inhibitory effects most probably are not due to an individual component of wild artichoke but rather to minor constituent fraction s as a whole in promoting the health benefits of the mediterranean diet the role of wild plants as important meal components deserves further appraisal

1859722 the ultimate fear is the fear of death the loss of our ego and everything we have in that sense fear is nothing but a form of attachment in this case to our life our concept of self and all our possessions etc
1859723 people see death as terrible as tragic because they want to live they see death as the enemy of life and therefore deny death which then becomes even more fearful and monstrous
1859724 thats the day i knew there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid ever
1859725 remembering brings life into focus it sorts out your priorities so you do not live a trivial life it helps you take care of the most important things in life first dont worry about dying that will happen successfully whether you worry about it or not
1859726 when i am attached to these things they cause me to be reborn in samsara and to die and be reborn countless times this has happened from past lives up until now and samsara and these aggregates are only in the nature of suffering what has kept me in samsara is this
1859727 from now on i will never allow myself to be under the control of the self cherishing thought
1859728 i will never separate from bodhicitta even for one second from now on up until my death and especially today until enlightenment and especially today i will never separate from bodhicitta
1859729 the reason why i have not become enlightened so far did not achieve liberation from samsara didnt achieve any realizations and the reason why i have been suffering in samsara so far is ego this great demon ego if i keep following this it will continuously do me the same harm it will never allow me to be enlightened or to be free from samsara it wont allow me to have any realizations whatever unfavorable situations obstacles unpleasantness or discomfort happens this all comes from ego all of this was done to me by ego
1859730 due to the past present and future merits collected by me and the merits of the three times collected by others buddhas bodhisattvas and all other sentient beings may i never separate from bodhicitta during the time of death during the intermediate stage during rebirth and at any time may i never ever be separate from bodhicitta and may i have the quickest realization of bodhicitta

1859751 so we thought ok can we design a video game that will help people practice positive patterns of thought
1859752 we needed to find a group that was very stressed and you know i always hang up on telemarketers frankly personally so theyre dealing with a lot of rejection all day long but after playing the game five minutes a day for a week something incredible happened the level of cortisol or the stress hormone in their bodies had dropped by 17 percent even more remarkable is the employees playing the game were rated as more self confident and then moreover they actually made more sales
1859753 we wanted to see if specific patterns of social information processing might contribute to stress if these patterns could be changed with the help of specially designed computer games and if the development of new habits of thought might lead to lowered stress levels in day to day life
1859754 our starting point is past research showing that insecurity feelings and daily stress arise in large part from anxieties about whether one will be liked accepted and respected by ones peers and significant others
1859755 to make a long story short whereas people with lower self esteem tended to show a pronounced attentional bias toward threat this tendency was essentially removed if they first played the find the smile game this suggests that attentional habits can indeed be trained by practicing the ability to orient toward positive and away from negative social feedback

1859858 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1859859 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1859860 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game

1859872 the market might be getting quieter overall but weve not noticed a downturn in business at all
1859873 there are pubs closing which is worrying but it tends to be the less well run pubs that do shut
1859874 and while the supermarkets sell drink cheaply its a different market if somebody wants a nice ale perhaps something different they will seek it out in a pub
1859875 its something different and people like the idea of time but it has to taste good nobody is going to buy a beer just because it is organic

1859885 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1859934 i still cant say whether i will ever want children i was so astonished to find that i did not want them at thirty the rememberance of that surprise cautions me against placing any bets on how i will feel at forty i can only say how i feel now grateful to be on my own i also know that i wont go forth and have children just in case i might regret missing it later in life i dont think this is a strong enough motivation to bring more babies onto the earth though i suppose people do reproduce sometimes for that reason for insurance against later regret i think people have children for all manner of reasons sometimes out of a pure desire to nurture and witness life sometimes out of an absence of choice soemtimes in order to hold on to a partner or create an heir sometimes without thinking about it in any particular way not all the reasons to have children are the same and not all of them are necessarily unselfish not all the reasons not to have children are the same either though nor are all those reasons necessarily selfish to create a family with a spouse is one of the most fundamental ways a person can find continuity and meaning in american or any society i rediscover this truth every time i go to a big reunion of my mothers family in minnesota and i see how everyone is held so reassuringly in their positions over the years first you are a chid then you are a teenager then you are a young married person then you are a parent then you are retired then you are a grandparent at every stage you know who you are you know what your duty is and you know where to sit at the reunion you sit with the other children or teenagers or young persons or retirees until at last you are sitting with the ninety year olds in the shade watching over your progeny with satisfaction who are you no problem youre the person who created all this the satisfaction of this knowledge is immediate and moreover its universally recognized how many people have i heard claim their children are the greatest accomplishment and comfort of their lives its the thing they can always lean on during a metaphysical crisis or a moment of doubt about their relevancy if i have done nothing else in this life then at least i have raised my children well but what if either by choice or by reluctant necessity you end up not participating in this comforting cycle of family and continuity what if you step out where do you sit at the reunion how do you mark times passage without the fear that youve just frittered away your time on earth without being relevant youll need to find another purpose another measure by which to jduge whether or not you have been a successful human being i love children but what if i dont have any what kind of person does that make me
1859935 oh yeah this is why i want to do this

1859952 the state power sucks in almost all branches of production it not only maintains the general conditions of the exploitative process the state more and more becomes a direct exploiter organizing and directing production as a collective capitalist
1859953 the state is the culmination of a process of concentration of different species of capital capital of physical force or instruments of coercion army police economic capital cultural or better informational capital and symbolic capital it is this concentration as such which constitutes the state as the holder of a sort of metacapital granting power over other species of capital and over their holders

1859956 where commands are no longer obeyed the means of violence are of no use everything depends on the power behind the violence the sudden dramatic breakdown of power that ushers in revolutions reveals in a flash how civil obedience to laws to rulers to institutions is but the outward manifestation of support and consent
1859957 derives from the fact that locally that form made it possible at least for an entire historical period for struggles between heterogeneous classes to be controlled and for not only a capitalist class but the bourgeoisies proper to emerge from these state bourgeoisies both capable of political economic and cultural hegemony and produced by that hegemony

1859961 recognition of national rights is an essential condition for international solidarity
1859962 the empowerment through this bureaucracy of the interests of the state conceived as an abstraction rather than as a personal fiefdom
1859963 by drawing on a theory of civil society without a theory of the state foucault does not open up the perspective of myriad powers in place of the conventional sovereign and singular power he introduces or posits a spurious universal warfare

1859965 while classes in order to become predominant have to constitute themselves as national classes the nation arises from class struggle

1859967 the lever of the revolution will have to be force
1859968 a real victory of an insurrection over the military in street fighting is one of the rarest exceptions
1859969 the proletariat is both an objective factor of political economy and a system of subjective awareness or rather a style of coexistence at once fact and value in which the logic of history joins the forces of labor and the authentic experience of human life
1859970 violence is the necessary condition of my emergence as a universal communal being for i can find common ground with the other only insofar as both of us can endure the mortal danger of the struggle and can thus think independently of a blind attachment to our particular selves

1859976 if i want to put my tits on my back its my business
1859977 a week later the two of us are sitting at a window table at the modern at moma during what has turned out to be madonnas biggest shit storm in years she pauses for a moment before referencing all the recent tabloid stories
1859978 i had asked her to have lunch with me before madonnas latest travails hit the papers because i wanted to talk to the person who with cher and madonna as clients has probably had to field perhaps the most phone calls ever about plastic surgery
1859979 cher is the very essence of old face cosmetic surgery run amok too tight skin weird lips eradication of interesting nose all of which adds up to a woman we almost dont recognize as the cher we grew to love in the seventies

1859987 we try to hit every genre in some way because the music industry is changing so much now like no one is doing hip songs now hip hop is not just like hip hop anymore its like hip pop pop songs are playing on hip hop stations hip hop songs are playing on pop stations
1859988 i wanna take it above and beyond that because like with our group were like the united nations we have so many ethnicities and different personalities we could touch like every type of fan weve made rock songs trance songs just straight hip hop straight pop songs
1859989 we just started making tracks on our own we made this song that became so popular tetris the song just got so popular we just starting growing off that its so weird that was honestly a song we just did like as a joke
1859990 we all write our own parts to the songs we all assist each other in writing its a group effort so we all have to be on the same page like if something doesnt sound right we switch up we work together to make everything sound intact
1859991 im trying to be a jack of all trades my main focus is obviously music but i love doing acting i dont particularly love modeling i have a great photographer that works with me all the time and helps me get my portfolio up and i cant be mad at that we all make solo songs we can all do it ourselves but we like to do it together because its more impactful we like the response that we get as a group rather than like solo stuff thats a path we want to take i just did transformers 2 i got a featured extra role in that movie i playe a quote unquote hot college guy which was pretty cool went to princeton university and i shot like 14 scenes so im excited for that to come out

1859993 i look up to my dad with pretty much everything i take his advice and i use it wisely
1859994 ive been writing raps and poetry since i was like a freshman in high school i was the kid in english class that would write the best essays
1859995 before i perform i guess i try not to talk to anybody i kind of like just to sit to myself and just think about the performance afterwards i talk to everybody im real talkative but like before im not talkative like i hate when people try to have conversations with me right before i get on stage
1859996 ill put myself out there that one song we have tetris theres this one part that i swear to god every time i hear that song i just like he pauses and i can hear the tension in his voice i dont forget but i mumble the words because im rappin so fast i completely forget how i say it all the time
1859997 so props to paige for keeping it fun and keeping it real
