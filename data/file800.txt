8000001 the obama campaign has sent to station managers and a letter the campaign has sent to the department of justice demanding a criminal investigation
8000002 politico has posted copies of letters the obama campaign has sent to station managers and a letter the campaign has sent to the department of justice demanding a criminal investigation of the group that is running the ads american issues project
8000003 the obama campaign plans to punish the stations that air the ad financially organizing his supporters to target the stations that air it and their advertisers
8000004 my worst enemy has been myself i can see that my perspective right now i can look back and see clearly that i was sabotaging myself
8000005 that was fear i had some issues that plagued me which resulted in always questioning and questioning again the act of working on music was always the most rewarding but also the most terrifying
8000006 touring was the reward but the act of creating and self examination and looking in the mirror clearly at yourself that was something i dreaded so id put it off thats why there were so many gaps between records and turning to drugs and alcohol getting in control at the forefront of life and getting older too i realized i do like doing this it doesnt have to be terrifying and going easier on myself doesnt mean the results drop to zero
8000007 getting off interscope at first it was great i was finally rid of these guys im not singling out interscope but they dont know what theyre doing but then it was great but now what do we do
8000008 these are the cards ive been dealt this is the climate right now and theres nobody to tell me no that combined with feeling generally good about my art and feeling excited again has left me reinvigorated theres not this giant obstacle of bureaucracy in the way
8000009 ive spent a lot of time thinking about stuff id rather not be thinking about
8000010 id rather be locked in a room working on music or onstage but because things are broken right now im thinking about how id want to be treated as a fan and how as an artist i can treat myself with respect not put myself in a situation where im in a right guard commercial
8000011 you have to acknowledge the fact that people steal music and they want it as soon as possible if you hear that a favorite bands music has leaked youre not going to wait a month to get it
8000012 as an artist you want people to get excited about it the slip is great for me because as an artist i want a lot of people to hear it
8000013 any business model i come up with is from a self centered point of view its about where im at
8000014 you say youre leaving but youll never go why are you keeping up this to and fro if this dont feel right the doors open wide but you know tonight youll be by my side
8000015 we intervene in the hardware stream and say how about a virtual network and that is starting to ramp up
8000016 we started to buy commercial suites like xensource now owned by citrix or vmware but we always hated their licensing programs and the way they tried to limit growth so we wound up back at xen org
8000017 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment
8000018 we were into coldfusion and j j allaire adopted linux early weve developed on top of linux ever since
8000019 i find myself always gravitating to the gnu type projects they are the best way to develop venture backed applications with the amount of creativity coming out of the community and the value right out of the box you realize a real benefit by always using foss
8000020 the other day i was looking around the office and realized we use a lot of linux applications
8000021 we didnt set out to build the company on linux but we wound up doing that because everything just fits we use
8000022 we still have to use exchange but were about to move over to an exchange knockoff with a great feature set called kerio
8000023 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
8000024 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
8000025 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
8000026 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense
8000027 i didnt think men of god were supposed to be mean
8000028 it was the most perfect time to start a web site about zune and i was one of the first few to create a zune related site
8000029 bidding was getting close to the buy it now price and i didnt want to lose zuneboards over a few thousand dollars
8000030 my first acquisition was a graphic site from someone in italy i was blown away when i found out he was 16
8000031 at first i tried to teach myself with books i would buy from bookstores however ultimately i was mostly self taught from other web development communities like forums digitalpoint com sitepoint com and namepros com
8000032 the internet is an amazing place you can practically learn anything you want if youre willing to make a time commitment
8000033 it is so easy to make money on the internet web development made for adsense sites affiliate marketing paid to post and the list goes on
8000034 i guess thats one reason why i am so thankful to god not everyone has the mentality and understanding of how things work online as i do
8000035 i only spent 30 minutes online a day on zuneboards
8000036 thirdly i felt that i wasnt doing my best to really make zuneboards grow to its full capabilities
8000037 i felt a new ownership would really bring in fresh leaders that were really motivated and focused on the growth of zuneboards
8000038 they dont get the respect of advertisers the bigger you are the higher the advertisers will pay for the same advertising inventory
8000039 i love sports i love to hang out i love to game ive played lacrosse and baseball in the past this will be my fourth year playing football as a running back
8000040 to be honest only a few of my close friends even know i do this
8000041 its kind of hard to see into my future right now but i can definitely imagine myself working for my church starting a nonprofit organization or even being a youth pastor
8000042 i cant imagine myself grown up sitting behind a computer all day making money while there are hundreds of millions of people who are starving and never felt gods love

8000059 you want to talk about drilling offshore lets talk about profits made by the oil companies without paying royalties
8000060 q i read your article regarding the limit on offshore drilling for oil that is set to expire on sept 30 what if the speaker of the house will not even bring it up for a vote does that mean the ban on most drilling will expire and we could start more drilling this article really got me thinking because i watch a lot of the news programs and no one has mentioned this i would appreciate your comments because that was one of the most interesting articles that i have read recently a thank you for your positive feedback my understanding from speaking with various folks who keep close tabs on congress is that the democratic controlled house is seeking to combine an extension of the ban on most drilling for another year with the annual spending bill which will be waiting for congressional action upon their return from vacation in early september if republicans stick to their guns and oppose the annual budget bill because it includes another extension of the offshore drilling limit this could lead to a government shutdown if a compromise isnt reached by the end of september

8000066 there are a variety of levels at which individuals experience change when it comes to the issue of homosexuality for some it may be a rapid total transformation but for many it is often a gradual process of dealing with difficult life issues habits and behaviors regardless of the timing any change is still change and as christians we know that the process of dealing with sin and becoming more like christ will continue throughout the course of our lives

8000081 the fake plastic ivy you have running the length of your cupboards up on top
8000082 i do realize what you were trying to do you wanted to draw the eye away from the empty space and the bare walls but you need something different there to accomplish that i would suggest a mixture of tall skinny glass vases or bottles a variety of colours maybe the deeper gem tones running all along the tops of your cupboards that will distract the eye from all the bare space and create an optical illusion seperating all that white from all that white

8000087 in addition to the negative or unhelpful thinking described in the challenging negative thinking fact sheet there are some common thinking errors that most of us make from time to time
8000088 about 200 imprisoned guerrillas formed a dissident group that has led to a remarkable movement within colombias prisons
8000089 no major effort to assist the victims of the guerrilla and paramilitary groups
8000090 are victims themselves they are not angels but were either forced by the farc or by very poor living circumstances many sincerely believing armed struggle was the way to a more just society
8000091 the prisons hold many diehard guerrillas who believe they have nothing to lose as they will probably be in prison for the rest of their lives there is nothing to restrain them from taking vengeance on defectors especially those who make guerrilla organizations look bad
8000092 guerrillas still at large must be assured safe conduct from wherever they are before they dare demobilize or sign the declaration
8000093 safe conduct almost surely means time in prison but they are willing to pay the price

8000113 mi domando il perch della cacciata di un direttore antonio padellaro che ha resuscitato un giornale morto e ne ha fatto un giornale libero dai partiti e anche perch e questo il peccato originale la suddetta cacciata sia avvenuta subito dopo che il capo di un partito
8000114 qui la cosa democraticamente pi preoccupante dice ancora travaglio a francesco specchia di libero non si capisce a che titolo ripeto questo signore abbia ritenuto di poter giubilare un direttore questo sconcerta non solo la redazione dellunit ma anche i lettori chi sei tu per farlo caro segretario di partito lo sbaglio il gesto di veltroni ripeto non si mai vista nella storia di un giornale una rottura cos violenta delle regole
8000115 parliamoci chiaro la coppia padellaro colombo sta allunit come feltri sta a libero
8000116 io ho cominciato a scrivere per lunit quando smise di fatto effettivamente di essere un giornale di partito ha dichiarato travaglio e se tornasse ad esserlo difficilmente la mia firma troverebbe posto e una questione di principio non sono tra quelli che accettano di tutto pur di conservare la propria rubrica concita de gregorio la stimo molto mi ha chiesto di restare e assicurato che non cambia nulla anzi e non vedo perch non ovrei crederle certo poi bisogna passare alla prova dei fatti
8000117 i vari colombo e travaglio credo non abbiano messo neanche un euro
8000118 dicci quando hai pronunciato la frase ma ch icazzo me lha fatta fare
8000119 centralismo democratico anni 50 per dire che il partito comanda mi sembra un po comica come visione adoro la litizzetto ma mi spice dirlo laccoppiata litizzetto unit stonata sdolcinata esibizionista capisco perch ero comunista e non lo sono pi auguri comunque a concita

8000121 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8000122 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8000123 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8000124 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8000125 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success

8000137 expect to see more of this happening if obama gets elected

8000165 i wouldnt much weight into reports that there are windows of possibility
8000166 following the logic expressed by his own campaigns ad against obama selecting biden he would have to select huckleberry
8000167 theres no secret meetings theres no secret handshakes theres nothing like that
8000168 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio
8000169 its safe to say that i dont pay any attention to it its just writing
8000170 im paying about as much attention to that as brett farve going to the jets
8000171 i think that mccain has been a very solid republican he doesnt really march to the tune of the republican establishment that doesnt make him not a republican if being a republican means you have to be for earmarks i guess that means he isnt a good republican
8000172 i think the republican philosophy when properly applied is the right philosophy i think the problem weve had is that we in too many instances over the last few years is weve been republican in name only
8000173 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
8000174 at this point unless he chooses a pro choice liberal mccain has the conservative vote
8000175 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
8000176 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
8000177 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

8000468 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago

8000489 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention

8000503 merging the very different user experience of the internet with that of the tv is no small task
8000504 making that experience an easy to use entertaining and memorable experience is an even greater one the widget channel platform is a very impressive user interface for both developers who want a flexibility and speed to market but it also provides consumers with a memorable unique approach to enjoying internet content and entertainment on their tv
8000505 no one could have expected that kind of result after only six years of operation
8000506 our very strong deposit growth enabled the bank to be largely self funded for residential and small business loans this reduced the banks exposure to the more expensive and volatile wholesale markets and enabled us to maintain competitive home loan rates in fact the bank continually led the market down in loan interest rates but still maintained some of the best term deposit and online call rates available
8000507 it is still signing up two thousand customers a week it is lending two billion more than it was a year ago deposits are up by nearly half the public are expressing their support for our bank very strongly
8000508 the only cloud on the horizon is the national partys secret promises behind closed doors to sell the bank
8000509 the financial result has been affected by new accounting procedures that change the way in which the profitability of loans is assessed the impact of that has been to increases last years profit but slightly constrain the result for this year but the really important fact is that the bank continues to increase profit month by month year by year
8000510 we clearly have struck a chord with small businesses in new zealand they like our rates and they like our service we are getting very solid growth in our business banking portfolio but at a level that we can ensure we maintain excellent service

8000512 do not i repeat do not use vinegar on a wood floor i own a cleaning company and am well aware of the damage this method can cause vinegar is acidic and will slowly eat away at the poly coating or wax coating or oil whatever your floor is sealed with it is fine for no wax linoleum and ceramic but dont use vinegar on wood floors if you have new wood floors using anything but what the manufacturer specifically recommends will void your warranty when in doubt use just water i use a product called ecomist colloid w and a rubbermaid commercial microfiber mop and it gets raves from my clients with wood floors
8000513 i recommend the rubbermaid commercial mop with a seperate wet and dry mopping head they just velcro to the mop you can get them at home depot for about 20 bucks and they do have replacement heads when you start to get icked out by the old ones but all you need to do is run the wet mop under the shower tap and use some shampoo to clean it out while the dry mop can be vacuumed with an attachment then thrown into the wash

8000516 its common knowledge that the least expensive part of horse ownership is buying the horse
8000517 its due in part to the economy but a lot of it has to do with the pastures dying off because of the drought people arent providing extra feed and the animals are losing weight the number of complaints is just going to keep going up until we see a break in the drought
8000518 theres been some horses showing up because of the economy and because of the drought

8000558 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated blood pressure although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8000559 not a fully developed therapeutic strategy due to potential adverse effects
8000560 for example numerous studies have reported that hyperuricemia independently predicts the development of hypertension even in individuals lacking features of the metabolic syndrome
8000561 if hyperuricemia precedes the development of hypertension then it cannot simply be a secondary phenomenon
8000562 the lack of adverse events for hypertensive participants receiving allopurinol in a small and short term study should not be construed to suggest that allopurinol is without adverse effects or even comparable to conventional antihypertensive medications because the study was not designed to make such an evaluation

8000609 this is something that people in the media world dont understand media in the 20th century was run as a single race consumption but media is actually a triathlon it s three different events people like to consume but they also like to produce and they like to share
8000610 heres something four year olds know a screen that ships without a mouse ships broken heres something four year olds know media thats targeted at you but doesnt include you may not be worth sitting still for those are things that make me believe that this is a one way change because four year olds the people who are soaking most deeply in the current environment who wont have to go through the trauma that i have to go through of trying to unlearn a childhood spent watching gilligans island they just assume that media includes consuming producing and sharing

8000635 ive received notice from apple that theyve been contacted by the tetris company about tris that im afraid is essentially game over do they have a case no not really i am convinced that if it went to court the copyright claim would get thrown out completely
8000636 the trademark perhaps not but if i changed the name to e g trys that would be much harder for them to argue
8000637 the trouble is im a college student and not an affluent one and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now
8000638 theres a point at which i am willing to give up and be practical to let the world have its way with that ever mistreated little ideal of principle thus its with great sadness that i must announce that ill be pulling tris from the app store on wednesday august 27th to remain in apples systems but publicly unavailable until i work out a solution to this
8000639 when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make tris available again

8000682 the sad trombone that plays on loop in the lobby
8000683 its purely a byproduct of gameplay and this notion of a highly destructible environment
8000684 sticking to our ethos of do no harm to the game we tagged the parts in the environment for ads and like everything else in the game they can be destroyed its mirroring what the studio wants out of gameplay and making the most of it if we did anything that wasnt destructible in mercenaries 2 itd be awkward its taking advantage of the full environment
8000685 having the ads be destructible doesnt have much to do with the go or no go it has more to do with the gameplay destructible ads actually sell quite well advertisers see it as a way to be engaged with the consumer

8000690 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realize that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer

8000711 after 11 years of faithful service my poor mustek scanner took its last breath last night because of this i was unable to scan and work todays comic in leau of this i present some fan art i did for my buddy naturally ill be holding a new scanner art sale to help fund the replacement of my poor mustek more on that sale when im not so tired

8000720 i was working on a cocktail called grounds for divorce
8000721 she is amazing and i wont be able to watch her play later do you mind
8000722 so the watson twins are good friends of ours whom we met when we were mixing their third album leaders of the free world in l a
8000723 and leela watson one of the twins made me a compilation of some different stuff and there was a bit of bob dylan and blonde redhead but there was one jessica hoop song on there and out of all the tunes it was the one that grabbed me
8000724 i got a little radio show on the bbc back home and i played the shit out of jessicas music so i interviewed her on the phone and then when we knew there was a couple support slots open we asked her if she would do it luckily she was up for it one of the joys of being in a band is when you get the chance to share the stage with somebody you admire you know i am a big fan of jessica hoops music and we get to watch her play from the wings before we go out knockout
8000725 of course it is a massive massive company the biggest but it means that it is absolutely unavoidable now to go where the money is we have little elbows to feed when we were younger we could afford every single decision we made to be based on principle or artistic grounds but to be honest working with a big record company doesnt compromise our principles anyways fiction is great and geffen is great and we are still friends with the guys we were at v2 with they are old friends so it literally it couldnt have worked out better
8000726 all of us have always had a hand in the production even when working with other producers but craig has the golden ears and he has put a lot of time and hours into learning how the process works
8000727 he has blown me away with this album i think it is our best sounding one yet
8000728 craig by his very nature looks at precision he loves things to be neatly arranged almost to artistic standards
8000729 he cannot understand why anybody would want anything less than perfect if it was me or pete making a record it would be so fucking slap dash it would skip between mono and stereo all the time
8000730 craig put the arpeggio down and the drums and the sort of bassline
8000731 we had just that for a long long time and originally the words over it were a poem about my first girlfriend it was called whenever i see a crimson 105 and it was okay it might have made an entertaining b side it wasnt brilliant i certainly didnt think it was album strength you know
8000732 it was one of those things where the benefits of being together with the same people for eighteen years is you have a language that nobody else could understand
8000733 we knew it was something special at that point i think every time we played it from the top we would pace around the room and try to act like somebody wasnt expecting that horn blast and then every time the horn blasts we would piss ourselves laughing because it is such an audacious opening move it was a lot louder than that we had to temper it a little bit because it was forcing the boys to turn it down in the car you dont want people skipping a tune
8000734 you are the only thing in every room youre ever in
8000735 that is a low fi recording on the album at first the song existed without the orchestration and we wanted the contrast between the beautiful opening coming in and just the five of us playing in a room
8000736 it is the only track we recorded where we all just sat down and played our instruments together in one take and we threw the violins in afterwards and because he was our mate we knew we had to have the best song on the record
8000737 how can i mine this idea for maximum immediate impact
8000738 i know you feel so low cause ive been there ill just keep it in the back of my mind i cant find the time

8000740 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8000741 i was appalled when i found the bank account information that sort of thing shouldnt have been listed on there
8000742 it would have been possibly quite easy to find if you know something about computers
8000743 we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
8000744 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
8000745 this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8000746 we have not seen the listing ourselves but we do recommend people wipe hard discs before they sell computers
8000747 we would not allow someone to openly sell bank details on our site but this seems to have been a genuine mistake

8000755 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
8000756 as evidenced by some of the comments on this blog during the ie7 days many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
8000757 while you browse the web your ie keeps a local record of which third party items your browser accesses and where they were accessed from

8000791 this is our time and i am privileged and proud to share it with you
8000792 in fact it is too bad that we dont see many more boycotts in usa by official bodies unpleased with media outlets and journalists because a boycott on a journalist is in fact a citation it means that the journalist is fulfilling its journalistic mission as the publics representative rather than serving as the representative of the government ministry or corporation it reports on the problem therefore is not xyz the problem lies with the media outlets and journalists that are not boycotted on occasion perhaps this means they are not critical or biting enough therefore here is yet another rule of thumb for the benefit of news consumers be careful of journalists who are loved by any government

8000921 you listen to stevie wonders records and theres beatles production techniques and acoustic guitars and you listen to bill withers and its a folk record mixed with a soul record

8000934 si somos capaces de canalizar estas ganas de que empiece ya el partido esa energ a la canalizamos al terreno de juego la trasladamos all somos intensos y muy solidarios como equipo tenemos posibilidades
8000935 es importante cumplir un objetivo por el que fui contratado
8000936 el partido tiene una dificultad vamos perdiendo 1 0 hasta que no seamos capaces de igualar la contienda hasta ese momento es donde nos hemos preparado hemos estado trabajando m s en la tranquilidad que hay que tener en 90 minutos nos hace falta un gol para que empiece la eliminatoria nos hemos preparado para tratar de igualar la eliminatoria que hoy est desnivelada
8000937 habl con la plantilla y les dec a a los jugadores que la obligaci n era entregarse en el terreno de juego correr luchar y pelear por esta camiseta esa es la obligaci n y la transmiti el presidente pero no habl de resultados
8000938 todos los que estamos en el atl tico sabemos que es un jugador importante pero hasta l lo ha dicho un equipo lo formamos todos los 24 jugadores de la plantilla y kun es uno de ellos tiene unas caracter sticas especiales y distintas pero est claro que la labor del conjunto est por encima

8000947 m ore dangerous than the satanic verses or the danish cartoons
8000948 the jewel of medina is a novel of womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith i was also aware that some could take offense at any fictional portrayal of muhammad especially one by a non muslim woman given the respect with which i treated the muslim prophet however i never expected to be killed because of it
8000949 when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by the free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried out

8000960 obama is in so many words a frivolous phony someone who really doesnt have any business running for president mccain is a strong leader who can defend the country
8000961 from obama honestly i dont sense a really clear message there are attacks on mccain some of which are quite good there are positive uplifting commercials but its hard for me to come up with a clear cut obama message in the way that its pretty simple for me to do with mccain

8000986 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity

8001251 so if my wiring is bad then its because your techs improperly installed it but youre not going to cover their work unless i pay you to fix problems they caused
8001252 we came here to support the afghans not to lead them
8001253 if you take a glimpse at the area you will presumably find out that there will be no need for air raids
8001254 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
8001255 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
8001256 nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
8001257 our task is to coordinate our actions with international community as much as possible
8001258 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8001259 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8001260 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
8001261 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
8001262 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
8001263 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
8001264 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
8001265 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
8001266 most adults and children with osteogenesis imperfecta lead productive and successful lives
8001267 i love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath
8001268 lingerie shouldnt be something you just put on for your lover you should do it for you
8001269 i know the picture the paparazzi want is me coming out of starbucks in jeans with my hair all messy but thats just not going to happen
8001270 i just think that when you take a minute to look your best you get what you want and
8001271 super sexy but also really fun at the same time
8001272 your house is blocking the driveway you better move it
8001273 the reason an officer at cia was terminated was for having unauthorized contact with the media and the improper release of classified information
8001274 dont think in terms of a failure of a polygraph being the reason for termination the polygraph is one tool in an investigative process
8001275 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
8001276 in each and every test what happens is after question two or three the questioner will pause and very deliberately take a long hard look at the chart and take a deep breath and sigh and say you did really well on question one but on the second question about whether you released classified information i am getting a strange reading
8001277 it is about an excuse to conduct a wide ranging inquisition
8001278 how would you like to be the examiner who gave him a test and say he failed what kind of a career would you have
8001279 its kind of like confessing to a priest you feel a little better by getting rid of your baggage
8001280 this is the most effective collection tool that we have in our arsenal of security tools to identify disqualifying behavior and disqualifying activities
8001281 i will never sit here and say this is a perfect tool because its not in and of itself it wont produce the truth but its a way at getting at the truth
8001282 i am getting the sense you are holding something back is there something you want to tell me
8001283 when people hear that they admit things it would be difficult to get in any other way
8001284 people will confess to crimes or make admissions about themselves or other people they may reveal suspicions about a co worker or explain they did something they should not have done the government loves that
8001285 theres a premise that its o k for someone to leak because theyre serving a higher purpose a higher loyalty
8001286 well the next thing you know you have a whole building full of people with a higher loyalty each to a different principle and pretty soon you dont have a functioning intelligence agency
8001287 the central intelligence agency directly violating its charter conducted a massive illegal domestic intelligence operation during the nixon administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the united states according to well placed government sources
8001288 its a beautiful example of how the press is really the most important overseer of intelligence in this country
8001289 millions of people all over the world had been killed or at least had had their lives destroyed by the c i a and the institutions it supports
8001290 from the start it was clear that senior administration officials were up to their necks in this mess and that they would stop at nothing to sabotage our investigation
8001291 there is a burden on the justice department and the white house to prove that they will pursue this aggressively and honestly if someone in leaked classified information boot him out and let the prosecutors deal with him
8001292 to explain itself will there be fewer mary mccarthys contemplating the costs and burdens of leaking to the press
8001293 is the defendants are not being charged with being agents of a foreign power but with receiving classified information without authorization most americans who read the newspaper are also in possession of classified information whether they know it or not the scope of the charges is incredibly broad
8001294 bob woodward would not be a wealthy bestselling author he would be serving a life sentence
8001295 spy the inside story of how the fbis robert hanssen betrayed america
8001296 from the criminal side there are a lot of difficulties with respect to this case
8001297 i wouldnt be surprised if they decline prosecution because it might create more problems than its worth
8001298 its been very difficult for the government to use the espionage act to obtain a conviction for simply leaking information
8001299 it was written to cover conventional espionage and spying not conventional leaking within the government
8001300 plainly is no exemption in the statutes for the press
8001301 would raise legitimate and serious issues and would not be undertaken lightly
8001302 the fact that there has never been such a prosecution speaks for itself
8001303 the system is ossified complicated and a relic of the cold war period
8001304 i think it needs to be looked at seriously again
8001305 obviously taking a much more forward leaning stance than any of us have seen for years
8001306 when a former officer or contractor fails to honour the legally binding agreement our publications review board may send the individual a written reminder that reminder includes the statement that permission to publish will not be denied solely because information may be embarrassing to or critical of the agency obviously such letters contain no threats
8001307 they are trying to intimidate the press and trying to intimidate employees
8001308 anybody who has been critical of the bush administration is getting letters
8001309 people at the agency are bright enough to see that is going on they dont need to be reminded
8001310 polygraph is more art than science and unless an admission is obtained the final determination is frequently what we refer to as a scientific wild ass guess swag
8001311 in childrens soccer all the kids run to the ball and thats somewhat like what is still going on in the community
8001312 what were striving for is transparency here on our part
8001313 resulted in a significant mishandling of the records such that the order of the documents in many boxes was lost
8001314 classified agreements are the antithesis of our reason for being
8001315 if records must be removed for reasons of national security the american people will always at the very least know when it occurs and how many records are affected
8001316 there is some wiggle room for us here but not a lot
8001317 officer knowingly and willfully shared classified intelligence including operational information
8001318 the damage has been very severe to our capabilities to carry out our mission
8001319 its up to the justice department to decide whether they want to pursue investigations separately
8001320 officers who were involved in or exposed to certain intelligence programs
8001321 through the course of these investigations a cia official acknowledged having unauthorized discussion with the media
8001322 the reporting that dana did was very important accountability reporting about how the cia and the rest of the u s government have been conducting the war on terror
8001323 whether or not the actions of the cia or other agencies have interfered with anyones civil liberties is important information for americans to know and is an important part of our jobs
8001324 i am pleased that the central intelligence agency has identified the source of certain unauthorized disclosures and i hope that the agency and the intelligence community as a whole will continue to vigorously investigate other outstanding leak cases
8001325 were talking about a person with great integrity who played by the book and as far as i know never deviated from the rules
8001326 i have no idea what her motive was but there is a lot of dissension within the agency and it seems to be a rather unhappy place
8001327 quite a good substantive person on the issues i dealt with her on
8001328 anybody who works for charlie allen and then replaces him has got to be good
8001329 it looks to me like mary is being used as a sacrificial lamb
8001330 a c i a officer has been fired for unauthorized contact with the media and for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information
8001331 this is a violation of the secrecy agreement that is the condition of employment with c i a the officer has acknowledged the contact and the disclosures
8001332 obviously i am opposed to criminalizing the dissemination of government information to the press
8001333 no post reporter has been subpoenaed or talked to investigators in connection with this matter
8001334 goss was determined to find the source of the secret jails story
8001335 the damage has been very severe to our capabilities to carry out our mission
8001336 that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information
8001337 i believe the safety of this nation and the people of this country deserves nothing less
8001338 i am pleased that the central intelligence agency has identified the source of certain unauthorized disclosures and i hope that the agency and the community as a whole will continue to vigorously investigate other outstanding leak cases
8001339 its a terrible situation when the president approves the leak of a highly classified n i e and people at the agency see management as so disastrous that they feel compelled to talk to the press
8001340 i think for the vast majority of people this will be good for morale
8001341 people didnt like some of their colleagues deciding for themselves what secrets should be in the washington post or the new york times
8001342 classified information is classified information its not to be leaked its not to be divulged
8001343 freedom in the middle east requires freedom for the iranian people
8001344 a deep misunderstanding of the limitations of national security intelligence
8001345 demands a response that promises however improbably to prevent future failures and the preferred response is a reorganization because it is at once dramatic and relatively cheap
8001346 the cia believes its officers should hear a range of informed opinion on issues affecting their work
8001347 uncertain shield the u s intelligence system in the throes of reform
8001348 preventing surprise attacks intelligence reform in the wake of 9 11
8001349 has become a new bureaucracy layered on top of the intelligence community
8001350 many of the responsibilities of the cia and demoted the agency to little more than a spy service
8001351 three distinct and largely incompatible intelligence cultures that are poorly balanced military intelligence civilian intelligence and criminal investigation intelligence
8001352 up and out promotions system discipline and strong mission orientation
8001353 a degree of hostility and disdain which the agency reciprocates
8001354 the aim is to prevent the crime not punish the criminals
8001355 casting a very wide net following up on clues assembling bits of information and often failing because there is as yet no crime
8001356 ambitious to expand its intelligence activities under the forceful leadership of secretary donald h rumsfeld and under secretary for intelligence stephen a cambone
8001357 is also immensely popular and politically powerful and stubbornly resistant to change
8001358 in a situation of considerable vulnerability as an unpopular agency and therefore a natural scapegoat
8001359 impair the ability of responsible united states government officials to protect the president the vice president and other individuals
8001360 official intelligence on iraqi weapons programs was flawed but even with its flaws it was not what led to the war on the issue that mattered most the intelligence community judged that iraq probably was several years away from developing a nuclear weapon the october 2002 nie also judged that saddam was unlikely to use wmd against the united states unless his regime was placed in mortal danger
8001361 we judge that all key aspects r amp d production and weaponization of iraqs offensive bw program are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war we judge iraq has some lethal and incapacitating bw agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents including anthrax for delivery by bombs missiles aerial sprayers and covert operatives chances are even that smallpox is part of iraqs offensive bw program baghdad probably has developed genetically engineered bw agents baghdad has established a large scale redundant and concealed bw agent production capability baghdad has mobile facilities for producing bacterial and toxin bw agents these facilities can evade detection and are highly survivable within three to six months corrected per errata sheet issued in october 2002 these units probably could produce an amount of agent equal to the total that iraq produced in the years prior to the gulf war
8001362 he said he had been told hussein had them dispersed among some of the loyal tribes
8001363 they wanted a big public defection which would have been good for the policy
8001364 a source who had direct access to saddam and his inner circle
8001365 oh he wont defect he must not be for real
8001366 create and deliver briefings write reports and represent counterintelligence field activity
8001367 once cleared they can get a higher salary outside and they are gone
8001368 this tactic may help for a bit but it will likely fall apart in the next budget cycle with those positions swiftly eliminated
8001369 the pentagon ramped up so fast it had to turn to contract personnel to have continuity
8001370 it takes time to get the young up to snuff and you need 10 to 20 years to get the value for that investment
8001371 often are needed as new intelligence systems are being built
8001372 private contractors are taking over jobs once reserved for highly trained agency employees
8001373 were getting more and more kids into these rigorous courses
8001374 when you have conversations about raising expectations thats what this has done
8001375 west ham united sungguh tidak memiliki rencana untuk menjual craig bellamy ia masih terikat kontrak dan ia setia bersama klub bellamy tetap merupakan bagian terpenting dalam rencana kami di masa depan
8001376 saya tidak dapat menjamin bila saya akan bertahan di espanyol saya memiliki tawaran untuk dipikirkan dengan agen saya juve merupakan salah satu klub yang tertarik dan jika mereka meminta kepada saya maka saya akan ke sana
8001377 mereka sungguh merupakan lawan terberat yang kami miliki di kualifikasi liga champions saya tahu publik mengharapkan kami dapat melaju tapi ini tidak mudah jika kami bermain seperti tim mickey mouse
8001378 liga belgia memiliki kualitas yang baik kami mendapat pertandingan yang sulit ketika melawan anderlecht beberapa tahun lalu jadi saya tidak terkejut liege dapat memberikan kami masalah
8001379 we are not to judge thrift solely by the test of saving or spending if one spends what he should prudently save that certainly is to be deplored but if one saves what he should prudently spend that is not necessarily to be commended a wise balance between the two is the desired end
8001380 of course we should what cheek they must have to disrupt our sleep
8001381 alright then on the count of three one two three
8001382 its not a mosquito its probably ermm something else how should i know
8001383 there are no mosquitoes in my house how many times do i need to tell you
8001384 i dont know they only seem to be biting me
8001385 do we have a right to privacy from eavesdropping activities
8001386 does the nsas criteria for retaining or discarding records of phone calls provide privacy
8001387 should there be informed consent before collection recruitment or intelligence exploitation
8001388 spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the efforts secrecy
8001389 ive known this for a long time and ive kept my mouth shut
8001390 to what new york times reporter james risen calls the program the nsa wiretaps that have been reported on
8001391 im referring to what i need to tell congress that no one knows yet which is only tertiarily connected to what you know about now
8001392 the extremely sensitive programs that i was a specialist in these things are so deep black that only a minute few people are cleared for these things
8001393 the worker bee who does the work writes the reports goes into the field does the liaison work makes the phone calls
8001394 destroys your career in the intel field makes you unemployable forever
8001395 the first one i got was from a retired military police officer
8001396 he shows how his teams prescriptions for urgent change were ignored leaving the u s vulnerable to another terrorist attack
8001397 the person most likely to encounter a person who means to do harm is the local law enforcement agent
8001398 information that might be used to identify a potential terrorist is not in the hands of those in a position to act on it
8001399 impact of the islamic debate the debate between muslim extremists and moderates also will influence the future terrorist environment the domestic stability of key us partners and the foreign policies of governments throughout the muslim world the violent actions of global jihadists are adding urgency to the debate within islam over how religion should shape government growing internal demands for reform in many muslim countries further stimulate this debate in general muslims are becoming more aware of their islamic identity leading to growing political activism but this does not necessarily signal a trend toward radicalization most muslims reject the extremist message and violent agendas of the global jihadists indeed as muslims endorse democratic principles of freedom equality and the rule of law and a role for their religious beliefs in building better futures for their communities there will be growing opportunities for countering a jihadist movement that only promises more authoritarianism isolation and economic stagnation
8001400 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8001401 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8001402 the overarching problem is that fisa written in 1978 is technologically antediluvian it was drafted by legislators who had no concept of how terrorists could communicate in the 21st century or the technology that would be invented to intercept those communications the rules regulating the acquisition of foreign intelligence communications were drafted when the targets to be monitored had one telephone number per residence and all the phones were plugged into the wall critics like al gore and especially critics in congress rather than carp should address the gaps created by a law that governs peacetime communications monitoring but does not address computers cell phones or fiber optics in the midst of war
8001403 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8001404 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8001405 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8001406 now i know how he feels of course one also has to allow for the possibility that there were no rumors only hopes but more about that in a subsequent missive
8001407 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8001408 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8001409 the thing that is important to know about the catholic vote
8001410 theres also a large middle and a lot of catholics make their choice case by case election by election
8001411 since lyndon johnsons landslide election in 1964 theres been a slow trickling away of catholics from the democratic party
8001412 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8001413 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8001414 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8001415 are a bad reflection on him as a human being

8001432 this grant will help enable genesee county and flint to provide the technologies that will assist law enforcement in their effort to make our homes and our neighborhoods safe
8001433 these resources also allow the city and county to keep police officers on the beat in high crime areas to prevent activities that hurt the entire community
8001434 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty
8001435 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8001436 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8001437 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8001438 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8001439 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8001440 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8001441 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8001442 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8001443 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8001444 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8001445 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8001446 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8001447 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8001448 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8001449 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8001450 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8001451 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8001452 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8001453 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8001454 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8001455 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8001456 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8001457 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8001458 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8001459 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8001460 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8001461 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8001462 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8001463 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8001464 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8001465 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8001466 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8001467 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8001468 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8001469 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8001470 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8001471 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8001472 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8001473 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8001474 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8001475 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8001476 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8001477 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8001478 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8001479 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8001480 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8001481 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8001482 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8001483 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8001484 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8001485 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8001486 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture

8001488 em resposta s declara es do presidente russo que afirmou esta ter a feira que est nas m os da europa evitar uma nova guerra fria
8001489 faremos tudo o que estiver ao nosso alcance para evitar uma nova guerra fria mas quanto a isso a bola est no campo dos europeus
8001490 se eles quiserem uma degrada o das rela es v o t la naturalmente mas se eles quiserem salvaguardar as rela es estrat gicas o que totalmente do interesse da r ssia e da europa tudo vai correr bem
8001491 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8001492 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8001493 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8001494 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8001495 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8001496 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8001497 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8001500 to support peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
8001501 bold and comprehensive changes are sometimes only possible in the wake of catastrophic events events which create a new consensus that allows us to transcend old ways of thinking and acting
8001502 a community that does not share information or work together a community of turf conscious people competing for influence that is not the community i lead today
8001503 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8001504 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
8001505 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
8001506 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
8001507 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
8001508 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
8001509 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
8001510 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8001511 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
8001512 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
8001513 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
8001514 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
8001515 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
8001516 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
8001517 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
8001518 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
8001519 an open debate would say to the enemy here is what were doing to do
8001520 joint congressional inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001
8001521 we have had discussions with congress in the past certain members of congress as to whether or not fisa could be amended to allow us to adequately deal with this kind of threat and we were advised that that would be difficult if not impossible
8001522 all leaks that compromise intelligence sources and methods are bad
8001523 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8001524 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8001525 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8001526 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8001527 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8001528 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8001529 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8001530 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8001531 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8001532 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8001533 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8001534 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8001535 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8001536 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8001537 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8001538 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8001539 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8001540 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8001541 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8001542 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8001543 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8001544 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8001545 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8001546 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8001547 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8001548 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8001549 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8001550 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8001551 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8001552 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8001553 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8001554 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8001555 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8001556 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8001557 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8001558 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8001559 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8001560 there are areas we need to work on and there are some real positives happening in english cricket at the moment
8001561 we believe in the rule of law and what i assured my european colleagues in my answer to foreign secretary straw is that the united states intends and will fully live up to obligations under our international commitments as well as obligations under us law we dont condone torture
8001562 well i define torture probably the way most people would in the eyes of the beholder what we do does not come close because torture in terms of inflicting pain or something like that physical pain or causing a disability those kinds of things that probably would be a common definition for most americans sort of you know it when you see it we dont do that because it doesnt get what you want
8001563 after a drive of approximately one hour the car came to a halt and mr el masri could hear the sound of airplanes he was removed from the vehicle still handcuffed and blindfolded and was led to a building inside he was told that he would be medically examined instead he was beaten severely from all sides with fists and what felt like a thick stick his clothes were sliced from his body with scissors or a knife leaving him in his underwear he was told to remove his underwear and he refused he was beaten again and his underwear was forcibly removed he heard the sound of pictures being taken he was thrown to the floor his hands were pulled back and a boot was placed on his back he then felt a firm object being forced into his anus
8001564 on his second night in the salt pit mr el masri was woken by masked men and once again brought to the interrogation room again six or eight masked black clad men were in the room mr el masri was interrogated by a masked man who spoke arabic with a south lebanese accent the man asked him if he knew why he had been detained mr el masri said he did not the man then stated that mr el masri was in a country with no laws and that no one knew where he was and asked whether mr el masri understood what that meant
8001565 mr el masri was and remains deeply traumatized by his treatment during the couse of his seizure and detention he was repeatedly beaten and threatened had an object forced into his anus was denied access to counsel consular officials or his family was roughly interrogated on numerous occasions and was secretly detained in squalid conditions for nearly half a year without charge or explanation
8001566 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or a third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity

8001570 w e do hold and have made clear that we hold some al qaida detainees as unlawful combatants under the law of war
8001571 on december 31 2003 khaled el masri a german citizen of lebanese descent was forcibly abducted while on holiday in macedonia detained incommunicado handed over to united states agents then beaten drugged and transported to a secret prison in afghanistan where he was subjected to inhumane conditions and coercive interrogation and was detained without charge or public disclosure for several months five months after his abduction mr el masri was deposited at night without explanation on a hill in albania
8001572 defendants subjected plaintiff el masri to prolonged arbitrary detention by detaining plaintiff without a warrant probable cause articulable sic suspicion or notice of charges and by failing to accord plaintiff due process or any legal consular or familial protection and support
8001573 persons are arrested detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty by officials of different branches or levels of government followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty which places such persons outside the protection of the law
8001574 it is very important that whenever he bowls a bad ball we get runs so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
8001575 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
8001576 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys no body had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
8001577 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8001578 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8001579 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8001580 temos de reagir de uma maneira ou de outra reagir evidentemente de uma forma militar
8001581 faremos tudo o que estiver ao nosso alcance para evitar uma nova guerra fria mas quanto a isso a bola est no campo dos europeus
8001582 se eles quiserem uma degrada o das rela es v o t la naturalmente mas se eles quiserem salvaguardar as rela es estrat gicas o que totalmente do interesse da r ssia e da europa tudo vai correr bem
8001583 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005
8001584 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
8001585 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
8001586 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
8001587 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
8001588 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
8001589 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8001590 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8001591 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8001592 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8001593 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8001594 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8001595 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8001596 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8001597 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8001598 i have conserved my speed in the ring and i can hit with force like always
8001599 i would love to fight against manny pacquiao because he has beaten a lot of mexicans over the years and i want vengeance
8001600 this will no doubt give tonnes of opportunities to those that can really throw a punch
8001601 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8001602 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8001603 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8001604 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
8001605 take two of these pills daily and return three times a week forever
8001606 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years
8001607 she still is but at that time a lot of guys were after her
8001608 we met and i knew all her friends but i never remember seeing her
8001609 i just felt i havent been in love like that like i did with her
8001610 she wanted me to get married with a white dress in a church
8001611 she was a woman with so much faith and prayer
8001612 she always used to give me advice or give her advice
8001613 he would double shift just to have the kids clothed i was just a housewife taking care of them
8001614 it was hard the kids started coming and i had to look for a secure job somewhere and we had to leave
8001615 whatever they did they were happy doing it they did whatever they wanted to they stayed over there by the sea just seeing that was a big enjoyment for me
8001616 for me id say i did the most compromising because she would stay mad at me for weeks if i didnt talk to her in realizing whos at fault you have to think about why did we start arguing and who was at fault try to talk it over thats the only way to do it
8001617 i was always happy i loved to be around him
8001618 i was very young and i was learning all these things from taking care of my kids and being a wife i just loved it
8001619 this shift from print to the computer does not mean the end of literacy what will be lost is not literacy itself but the literacy of print for electronic technology offers us a new kind of book and new ways to read and write
8001620 in a postmodern world new media illiteracies may play an important role in identity formation the exercise of power and the negotiation of new social codes
8001621 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8001622 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8001623 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8001624 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8001625 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8001626 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8001627 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8001628 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8001629 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8001630 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8001631 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8001632 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8001633 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8001634 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8001635 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8001636 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8001637 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8001638 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8001639 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8001640 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8001641 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8001642 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8001643 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that

8001647 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8001648 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8001649 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8001650 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8001651 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8001652 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8001653 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8001654 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8001655 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8001656 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8001657 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8001658 what kind of composing writing creates conditions for open maybe even action oriented situations for reading and extended composing
8001659 how and why do certain writers create a relationship with a reader that involves trust and believability
8001660 i thought maybe a lot of the kids wouldnt like me but ive already made a friend
8001661 its gone smoothly weve had some glitches but were working them out
8001662 the whole point of today was to meet with administrators and meet students just to see what issues we need to address
8001663 we still have maintenance issues but overall things have gone well today
8001664 its time for her get back into the classroom and learn something
8001665 is a lifestyle brand that celebrates feeling well and living joyously
8001666 only when you feel good can you truly be the best that you can be
8001667 the main events unfolded in georgia because i stress we are taking about a russian georgian war the country georgia was attacked from two fronts that is from abkhazia and south ossetia over 20 000 men were engaged in the conflict the russian army it appears had about 25 000 men and several hundred tanks missies were fired and a strategic bomber was in the air missiles were fired from iskander missile systems i must confess that at first i did not believe that iskanders had fired on georgia fired from dagestan as the georgian authorities claimed but later they showed photographs of these two iskanders one of which the georgian authorities maintained hit the baku supsa pipeline at the time the pipeline was not operating that is we dont know if it had been damaged or not the other iskander fired at a square in gori they claimed it was photographed with the appropriate markings on it of course im not a specialist and cannot say whether it was iskander or not but this is easy to establish in other words when we are taking about such field tests of effective weapons and major actions on the fronts this is russian georgian war precisely a war that had been planned well in advance its clear that such masses of people especially in russia cannot be deployed in a day or two as we see for their deployment they require repairing rail tracks in abkhazia by the railway troops whose duty in our country is to prepare a bridgehead for hardware support to say that this was a war to defend south ossetia would be more or less the same as to say that the second world war had as its ultimate goal the protection of the rights of germans in sudetenland
8001668 on the whole this story abounds in tonnes of absolutely amazing details for instance i understood that one of the main conflicts one of the main motives which had made saakashvili decide to strike first was the fate of the residents of the georgian enclave situated between java and tskhinvali it is cut off from mainland georgia saakashvili attacked after for the first time in the history of the georgian ossetian conflict the enclave had come under heavy artillery fire both from tskhinvali and java they were wiping it from the face of the earth this is beyond doubt i heard about this not from the military i heard it from people who had fled tamarasheni kurta and kekhvi from the villages that were being razed to the ground i stress before saakashvili attacked tskhinvali i could not understand how they had managed to flee i asked them i asked other people and was given an astonishing answer to this question the thing is that there was a chechen peacekeeping post there that is yamadayevs post and as of 9 august the trans caucasian highway was being cleared by both russian and chechen units in their drive towards tskhinvali so the chechens provided one of the main retreat routes for these residents and truly helped them they chechens said you saved us when you gave us shelter in georgia during the chechen war and the chechens wont forget this it seems that if the chechens had not done this russia would have had to answer for very serious ethnic cleansing because its clear what would have happened to the residents of this enclave if the looters had arrived
8001669 what is the situation in georgia today after all troops are being pulled out from georgia and not only from gori but also it seems from the central highway linking western and eastern georgia which was closed for travelling in the last week this was very hard for georgia because this was meant to destroy the georgian economy it seems but it has not besides a railway bridge was blown up in georgia the port in poti is not in a good shape after it was bombed a little in other words in theory and economic crisis should have started in georgia but it has not the following thing has happened a palestinization of georgia of the caucasus has taken place georgia has been split into a georgian israel which will quickly integrate into the west will get money and nato membership will continue to build its economy especially as communication between two parts of georgia has been restored and there will be a kind of palestinian territories abkhazia and south ossetia which will develop along hezbollah lines its not very nice that russia is taking part in all this moreover its not quite clear what russia needs this for when we financed the palestine liberation organization we did this at least far from our borders now we are doing the same thing very close to them and its unclear what the repercussions will be for us in the north caucasus or perhaps quite clear
8001670 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
8001671 buyers whove been on the sidelines should take a closer look at whats available to them now in terms of financing and incentives given some of the inventory on the market we also strongly encourage buyers to get a professional home inspection
8001672 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
8001673 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
8001674 ah sei proprio un capoccione va bene vorr dire che presto sarai un mio insegnante e allora mi passerai le soluzioni dei test
8001675 hai sbagliato binario questo va al secondo livello lo sai sei piccolo
8001676 capisco bruci le tappe chi te lo fa fare amico
8001677 non ci voglio andare non voglio andare al secondo livello
8001678 we could turn this country into chechnya we had enough people and equipment to do that or we had to do nothing and stay a modern european country
8001679 eventually we would have chased them away but we would have had to go to the mountains and grow beards that would have been a tremendous national philosophical and emotional burden
8001680 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8001681 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8001682 would i really continue to wear this after a few weeks
8001683 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident
8001684 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner
8001685 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8001686 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8001687 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8001688 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8001689 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8001690 you know who your true friends are when you move
8001691 tara there is no one that i know that doesnt love you
8001692 quiero que sepan las personas que se la llevaron que la tienen que si a ellos no les salieron las cosas y silvita ya estuviera con dios entonces que me digan d nde la dejaron para nosotros ir por ella y ya estar en paz no sobreviviendo
8001693 pero si silvita estuviera con vida pues entonces que me la devuelvan yo creo que ellos tienen a quien querer alguien que los quiera yo creo que ellos tienen coraz n que late
8001694 hasta ahorita no s porqu lo hicimos pero ah vamos en el barco todos navegando en contra de la tormenta y la corriente yo no s si la situaci n el hoy y el momento nos llev y dijimos vamos a gritar qu hacemos cu les son los pros cu les son los contras a qu apelamos
8001695 quien se casa es mi hermana el pr ximo mes de septiembre
8001696 estoy muy contenta con fer llevamos ocho meses de noviazgo pero de boda no hemos hablado nada
8001697 espero venir al distrito federal con este montaje de rub n lara
8001698 siempre comento la preocupaci n de no creernos porque si tenemos un mal torneo volvemos a tener esta misma situaci n problemas en la tabla porcentual por eso es que vemos la opci n de dejar un grupo de jugadores aqu
8001699 la idea es que nosotros podamos hacer entre estos dos torneos apertura 2008 y clausura 2009 la directiva marc un m nimo de 26 puntos en cada torneo que dar an un total de 52 y con esto nosotros apenas nos mantendr amos ah porque quitas un a o de 50 puntos y ojal podamos lograr 52 puntos en el actual a o para mantenernos si tuvi ramos malos torneos y nos quitan los de 50 puntos bajar amos otra vez a un porcentaje muy bajo caer amos por ah del d cimo tercero o d cimo cuarto lugar son cosas que queremos prever para no caer en la situaci n que sufrimos hace dos a os
8001700 en primer lugar no estamos menospreciando ning n torneo de repente parece que las palabras que dije la semana pasada dieron un giro y las acomodaron vamos a llevar lo que nosotros pensamos que debemos de llevar los que est n m s acostumbrados a jugar se quedar n a preparar a conciencia el juego del domingo nosotros no tenemos jornada doble vamos a jugar hasta el domingo entonces vamos a salir hoy y esperamos regresar el viernes con un buen resultado
8001701 sabemos que son jugadores con una gran determinaci n nosotros tambi n debemos de tenerla es un juego donde hay roces entradas fuertes ojal siempre sean honestas buscando ganar la pelota y no buscando hacer da o a un compa ero de trabajo pero sabemos ciertas cosas del futbol que se practica no tenemos una gran idea del equipo que vamos a enfrentar como mencion ellos no son lo profesionales que somos en m xico no tienen la infraestructura de ellos sus deportes son otros como en las olimpiadas en los deportes donde ganaron pero vamos con toda la seriedad
8001702 me dicen que est a punto de llegar si no hoy posiblemente ma ana
8001703 asimismo en las ciudades mesoamericanas encontramos una gran diversidad de petroglifos asociados con astros y festividades
8001704 its going to be in the same vein of mtvs the hills but ours is going to be more realistic
8001705 con canciones nuevas alegres y temas que hac a a os no me hac an sentir tan satisfecho
8001706 si no cantara no se que har a de mi vida
8001707 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico de madrid para m y para mis jugadores es el partido de mayor trascendencia algo que coment con el presidente del club enrique cerezo que reconoci que tambi n para l era el de m s importancia desde que accedi al cargo
8001708 para m desde luego es importante dirigir al atl tico de madrid en la champions league porque fui contratado para ello
8001709 nos hemos preparado para afrontar un partido dif cil porque vamos 1 0 en contra
8001710 la plantilla es consciente de que no le podemos meter m s presi n entiendo que la gente diga es el salvador pero el plantel es inteligente y sabe lo que tiene que hacer en cada momento
8001711 i heard it is going to be a lot of snow
8001712 i want to hear about a winter with no snow no cold and definitely better than last year
8001713 skateboard decks are such a great medium for expression both physically and as a graphics instrument
8001714 every time we bring a skateboard deck up off the ground to eye level in an aesthetically pleasing way we bring joy to the viewer this isnt a business its a movement
8001715 as a pro skateboarder i always considered skateboarding a fine art as an artist i see the skateboard as a canvas throughout my life amp career art and skateboarding have been my primary form of expression and im passionate about being able to cross pollenate the two worlds
8001716 it is wonderful that the world of skateboarding and art could collaborate to help girls stay in school in third world countries
8001717 its the end of the road you belong to me i belong to you
8001718 wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it thats like a kid who sees his toys before christmas it takes away from me and i think it takes away from the fans as well when its time imma give it to you they leaked my record with me and
8001719 n s usamos express o barulho fenot pico para nos referirmos observa o de que organismos geneticamente id nticos vivendo no mesmo ambiente s vezes mostram varia es fortes nas suas propriedades biol gicas

8001721 um dos pontos principais do nosso artigo identificar as condi es nas quais os genes para o auto sacrif cio voltado produ o do bem comum podem persistir e n o serem eliminadas pela sele o natural

8001723 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
8001724 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8001725 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
8001726 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
8001727 what the exception says in essence is lobbyists cannot buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor one member
8001728 but they can buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor multiple members
8001729 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8001730 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8001731 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8001732 at this stage he is refusing to cooperate with the israeli police and we cannot legally force him to do so
8001733 i have found it suitable to play my role writing books or in newspapers to shed light on what i believe to be the threat by iranian influence to global security the middle east and persian gulf regions
8001734 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 that he stiffed the city
8001735 i put like all the change i had in the meter
8001736 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8001737 this court finds that defendants discharge was reasonably related to the governments interest in ensuring that its soldiers are fit to serve
8001738 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8001739 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8001740 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8001741 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8001742 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8001743 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8001744 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8001745 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8001746 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8001747 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
8001748 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8001749 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8001750 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8001751 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8001752 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8001753 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8001754 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8001755 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8001756 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8001757 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8001758 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
8001759 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
8001760 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
8001761 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
8001762 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
8001763 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
8001764 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8001765 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8001766 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8001767 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8001768 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8001769 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8001770 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8001771 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
8001772 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8001773 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8001774 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8001775 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8001776 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8001777 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8001778 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8001779 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8001780 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8001781 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8001782 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8001783 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8001784 n o que eu nunca percebi que uma coisa t o dif cil de admitir que voc faz de conta que n o existe um atestado de que voc n o boa m e pelo menos eu pensava assim onde foi que eu falhei por que comigo nunca usei droga na minha adolesc ncia nem sabia o que era ouvia falar mas era uma coisa distante usada por gente de classe mais baixa que mora na periferia mesmo quando dava aula ouvia falar de drogas mas n o conhecia de bebida eu quero dist ncia meu pai alco latra e at hoje n o admite quando ele bebe fica violento briga faz esc ndalos sou a filha mais velha e sempre procurei ajudar minha m e ao mesmo tempo tenho pena e raiva do meu pai por ele fazer tudo isso e eu n o saber o que fazer peguei um tipo de avers o pelo lcool imagine se meus pais falavam comigo sobre drogas de jeito nenhum eu tamb m n o conversava com meus filhos sobre isso porque achava que era fora da nossa realidade depois eu via que realmente o problema existia mas achava que dentro da minha casa n o comecei a desconfiar de alguns amigos do meu filho eles tinham comportamentos estranhos maneiras de se portar de se vestir e l gico passei a desconfiar do bruno tamb m mas da a ter certeza de que o problema existia foi um bom tempo a primeira vez que meu marido foi chamado na delegacia senti raiva do bruno e ao mesmo tempo queria proteg lo depois pensava ah deve ser o pessoal com quem ele est andando arranjava uma s rie de desculpas e justificativas para o fato de ele estar usando drogas ah vai ver que a pol cia exagerou n o era tanto assim ou ent o ah essa fase de adolesc ncia conturbada ele deve estar s experimentando mas isso vai passar na verdade nunca imaginei que a coisa fosse tomar o rumo que tomou ele desaparecia durante dias voltava num estado dif cil de acreditar roubava coisas dentro de casa as j ias que eu tinha foram todas outras vezes ele se envolveu com pol cia sumiu s fomos saber dele no pronto socorro com o nariz quebrado foi muito dif cil eu me sentia culpada e ficava amarrada n o sabia o que fazer que atitude tomar procuramos ajuda psic logo aconselhamento uma s rie de coisas que n o deram em nada s quando fomos para o amor exigente e o narc ticos an nimos passamos a ver como o nosso comportamento era facilitador percebemos que tamb m ramos pessoas doentes complicadas e que n o pod amos resolver tudo come amos a colocar limites o bruno perdeu a chave de casa estabelecemos hor rios para ele voltar algumas vezes ele respeitou a maioria n o ent o ele dormia fora de casa no capacho na escadaria na sala de recep o do pr dio porque n o abr amos a porta era muito dif cil eu n o dormia ficava com o cora o na m o aquelas noites de frio meu deus onde ele est o que estar fazendo mas eu tinha certeza de que se n o agisse assim nada iria mudar n s n o t nhamos mais vida era tudo em fun o dele e nunca sab amos onde ele estava quanto tempo ia ficar fora se ia voltar como ia voltar hoje eu falo com certa tranq ilidade porque j passei por isso mas no momento tudo muito dif cil nesses cinco anos eu trabalhei meus ressentimentos n o tenho mais aquela m goa aquela raiva que me acompanhava por tudo que meu filho fazia mas por outro lado eu n o posso esquecer porque se eu esquecer vou ser fisgada pelo bichinho do j estou bom e na verdade a gente nunca est totalmente bom tem sempre que continuar trabalhando tivemos v rios casos de filhos de amigos nossos que morreram de overdose meu marido esteve domingo agora no enterro de um deles esse morreu assassinado ent o uma escolha deles hoje eu entendo que foi uma escolha do meu filho como a escolha de qualquer pessoa continuar ou n o nessa vida mas freq entando esses dois grupos fico mais tranq ila porque eu estou fazendo a minha parte a parte dele s ele pode fazer eu n o posso fazer por ele
8001785 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8001786 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8001787 j sabemos que a gen tica e as infec es infantis t m um papel importante no desenvolvimento da diabetes tipo 1 em crian as mas os resultados desse estudo indicam que o modo como o beb nasce pode afetar as chances de desenvolver essa condi o

8001790 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8001791 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8001792 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8001793 modesty is to merit what shade is to figures in a picture it gives it strength and makes it stand out
8001794 support a vibrant educated and engaged membership committed to living sustainability and educating others about the imperative to do so
8001795 i place a high moral value on the way people behave i find it repellent to have a lot and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the word politeness of the heart a gentleness of the spirit
8001796 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8001797 when one remains modest not after praise but after blame then is he really so
8001798 i wasnt given much of a choice i did not know what was going to happen if i didnt show up
8001799 i think that its unbelievable that somebody would constantly who up for a two month period if they were going to be assaulted especially to the extent that mr whiteside claims
8001800 as a young girl i vividly and fondly remember walking into my grandmothers depression era kitchen greeted by the tantalizing and unforgetable smells of spicy ginger snap cookies homemade applesauce and succulent homemade blueberry pies
8001801 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8001802 no creo que hoy haya habido un paso atr s en nuestra preparaci n igual no hemos estado tan precisos pero hay un contrario que tambi n juega y hemos tenido cinco o seis ocasiones de gol delante del portero hemos perdido pero hemos podido empatar e incluso ganar
8001803 she opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy when it snows she has no fear for her household for all of them are clothed in scarlet
8001804 charity is neither weak nor blind it is essentially prudent just temperate and strong unless all the other virtues blend together in charity our love is not genuine
8001805 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over
8001806 brothers if someone is caught in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently but watch yourself or you also may be tempted
8001807 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
8001808 the tongue also is a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole person sets the whole course of his life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell
8001809 being singularly cheerful as well as charitable and tender hearted
8001810 friend you allow me my vestments and i shall allow you your peculiar hat
8001811 for george will be so much nearer the throne of grace
8001812 we know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers anyone who does not love remains in death

8001821 the federal aviation administration says a communication failure at a georgia facility that processes flight plans for the eastern half of the u s is causing flight delays around the country
8001822 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg
8001823 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
8001824 she did not bring any of this on her and the jury believed her
8001825 i am disappointed this this i mean this man tore a family apart and to get one year i dont think is really justice
8001826 she was able to actually describe what it sounded like it smelt like i mean basically anything you could possible think of and something that a 5 year old would not basically know
8001827 its often not a stranger lurking in the dark its usually someone in their family and as a result they are reluctant to come forward
8001828 credibility was an issue all the way around they acquitted him on two counts and convicted on one which was six or seven years ago now so its a pretty hard case to get a handle on
8001829 one of the most significant innovations in coffee brewing since the introduction of the espresso machine
8001830 we committed to our customers that we would reinvent coffee and once they taste coffee brewed from the clover we know they will want to come back for more
8001831 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8001832 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8001833 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8001834 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8001835 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8001836 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8001837 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8001838 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8001839 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8001840 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8001841 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8001842 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8001843 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8001844 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8001845 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8001846 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8001847 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8001848 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8001849 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8001850 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8001851 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8001852 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8001853 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8001854 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8001855 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8001856 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8001857 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8001858 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8001859 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8001860 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8001861 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8001862 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8001863 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8001864 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8001865 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8001866 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8001867 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern

8001884 honestly when i heard it it was just two or three days after the crash
8001885 i needed to stay home to be close to my family and be there for my mom and family
8001886 there was a warm mutual handshake you could feel it he was very interested in wanting to be here
8001887 i couldnt even believe he was taking time to meet me
8001888 he fit transylvanias profile of an outstanding well rounded student
8001889 you let him know that youre there but that he will not be treated differently than anybody else
8001890 he had a deep sense of personal loss and whenever you have a student like that you choose your words carefully you just try to keep an eye on them and see how theyre progressing
8001891 he did that tremendously well it was a difficult time and being treated as normal as possible helped me with my grief
8001892 theres never been a time when i thought i should bring it up or he should bring it up
8001893 i realized how much i would miss my mom and all my friends i was extremely homesick

8001918 our governor christine gregoire is one of the leaders in america on this subject
8001919 she has really led on global warming she understands the economic potential on this
8001920 christine gregoire gets that this is an economic opportunity to sell to china
8001921 so she is just front and center and i do think this is an important issue and washington gets it the name of the game is innovation and we are one of the most innovative states in the country its in our genes
8001922 we were just rated one of the top three states in the country to do business in
8001923 we have a thriving economy in a sea of despair across the country okay and thats partly because of christine gregoires leadership that dog wont hunt

8001933 the whole project has been a new experience for me im working with a writer who helps me out so much with how i can make my work be its best its been wonderful its been such a blast working with greg so far were more than halfway through it so i think ill be sad when were near the end

8001935 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
8001936 hey rip van winkle you wanna do this book with me
8001937 it can be a matter of smells gestures an ineffable combination of impressions that makes what we call intuition tell us something
8001938 we have a memory that needs to be filled up with sensory impressions
8001939 we need to see feel smell hear taste and experience with our senses this collection of data cant be replaced by studying course literature
8001940 experience is under evaluated today and this is perhaps because we havent understood this type of tacit knowledge now we know thanks to brain researchers
8001941 if you look at the year over year numbers they are still going down but not accelerating to the downside quite as much as they had been in a number of cities
8001942 if the economy gets weaker this stability we see in housing will give way and well get traditionally weakness in housing that will come from the economy itself so we have to be concerned about that
8001943 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8001944 once housing prices stabilize that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8001945 i anticipate seeing price support probably sometime in the first or second quarter of next year when the foreclosure market stabilizes back to more normal numbers
8001946 we still have months to go before the economy and the housing market will be improving thats not going to happen until 2009 maybe not until the summer of 2009
8001947 how can we restore confidence in american leadership in the world

8001950 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8001951 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8001952 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8001953 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8001954 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8001955 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8001956 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8001957 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8001958 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

8001976 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
8001977 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
8001978 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
8001979 lobbyists beware watchdog groups are making the rounds to monitor convention goers compliance with new ethics rules and call attention to events where corporate sponsors wine and dine members of congress and their aides
8001980 this flood of unlimited soft money from special interests and the lavish parties and wining and dining it pays for at the conventions runs counter to the federal election law and congressional ethics rules
8001981 the new lobbying law has meant a decided change for the better in the nature of convention partying
8001982 but the new rules have brought with them a new and welcome caution for those on both sides of the partying transaction the era of big gift bags is over

8001986 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8001987 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8001988 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8001989 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8001990 just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husbands administration
8001991 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8001992 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8001993 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8001994 were taking a stand and not backing down its we the people not we the dnc we are standing up for what is right i know in my heart
8001995 adobe as a software company has to figure out a way to make money as we move to web 2 0 where everything is online and everything is free
8001996 theres lots of competition in this area so how can it take its franchise photoshop and turn it into something usable
8001997 whats happening is this capability photos and videos is coming within the reach of everyman
8001998 the tools making it accessible need to be put into place as well they need to broaden their products to appeal to wider markets that doesnt mean dumbing them down but hiding their complexity making the controls easier
8001999 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person
8002000 i just dont think he gets it he is out of touch
8002001 i dont think he realizes what ordinary american families are going through i dont think the bush administration understands what ordinary american families are going through but i do and thats why im running for president of the united states of america move this country in a new direction
8002002 john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8002003 so if you think that the last eight years have been good then you need to go ahead and vote for him
8002004 i dont expect this will deter the obama campaign from misrepresenting my proposals but lest there be any doubt you have my pledge my reforms would not force anyone to go to a non va facility and do not signal privatization of the va
8002005 no challenge was too great for a world that stands as one
8002006 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8002007 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8002008 about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8002009 when im president im going to have my attorney general go through every single executive order that george bush has issued and if there are laws that are unconstitutional then i am going to overturn them and were going to get our government back on track
8002010 under george bush they can wiretap you and read your e mails without checking off with a court and getting a warrant ahead of time even though the 4th amendment says you shouldnt be able to do that
8002011 there are a lot of people in there but one of the great things about america is we give even bad people due process so there are areas where we have gone too far
8002012 is out of town up in denver for some big party theyre throwing up there

8002029 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8002030 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8002031 somebody said today that thered only been 16 disputed home run calls this year i shouldnt say only 16 is a lot they may have determined the outcome of 16 games
8002032 if you have the means to get something right then just get it right
8002033 if you wrote the perfect fairy tale ending theyd be meeting us again in the alcs but this is our chance to kind of put that on the backburner
8002034 weve got to go in there and take care of business but as far as being able to play at yankee stadium that and fenway are the two meccas of baseball
8002035 getting to play at fenway every day and getting a chance to play at yankee stadium before they open up the new one is a pretty cool experience and something ill be able to say i did for the rest of my life
8002036 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years so its a pretty special cathedral of baseball
8002037 hopefully im around next year to see the new one
8002038 when i was with cleveland as a player in 1988 we were terrible but you go to yankee stadium and you felt like the game was important
8002039 you know you were playing in games that people cared about
8002040 ridiculous celebs thinking theyre helping obama when theyre actually doing the exact opposite
8002041 but its not surprising that barack obama and his fellow celebrities stick together

8002050 monday when the announcement came out the ohio state game was going to be on the bigten network the phones really started ringing
8002051 their last question would be is there any chance we could get this in by friday or saturday
8002052 last saturday i went to the local pub to watch the game because i couldnt have it it wasnt on my cable
8002053 the fair access to networks act is kind of out of frustration
8002054 we want to fix it set up a 3rd party to arbitrate this give their best offers the cable companies nfl network and the bigten and let the arbitrator decide

8002059 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8002060 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
8002061 could also give a signal to the city opera board members to give full financial support to the new vision
8002062 in an intensely competitive commodity business ovti must demonstrate the ability to deliver both gross margin improvement and increased revenue either with more cost effective products or differentiated technology
8002063 we do not think it would make sense for cree to partner exclusively with lg display the 2 panel manufacturer in the world alone and risk losing potential business
8002064 the opportunity should help cree achieve its goal of maintaining its chip business flat sequentially and should therefore be viewed as a potential marginal positive
8002065 but he listened very intently and tried to comfort her he was very patient and attentive
8002066 she won california and people are scared to wear hillary buttons
8002067 if barack obama is my second choice i think they should be happy with that and not try to beat me down
8002068 real no matter how much you try and deny it
8002069 a lot of supporters of hillary are not totally convinced
8002070 my view is that hillary stood for our community time and time again and i will stand for her i will follow sen clintons lead
8002071 our nomination is decided to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states to lead our country into the future thats what this convention is about

8002076 but im not comfortable with all her supporters i think a good number of them will defect
8002077 i understand this process and what has to happen emotionally with people after they experience loss and anger
8002078 i also know at end of the day everyone has to unify women especially
8002079 i dont believe we can tolerate a john mccain as president who is going to appoint supreme court justices that are going to erode roe v wade and a womans right to privacy thats the bottom line for me and a lot of women
8002080 i know hes going to win by making sure every vote is cast and every vote is counted
8002081 this is going to be a grassroots campaign like it was in the primaries we have a lot of work to do its not going to be easy
8002082 as long as he is healthy he doesnt have to disclose
8002083 because steve jobs has been appearing in public regularly investors are getting a valuable form of disclosure
8002084 i think the stock would drop 25 percent or more if he were to leave the company unexpectedly
8002085 the extent to which the internet served as a supplement to television was unprecedented
8002086 nbcolympics com served up more than 1 2 billion pages and 72 million video streams through saturday more than doubling the combined traffic to its site during the 2004 games in athens and the 2006 games in turin
8002087 the popularity of the site will very likely make digital rights more significant in next years bidding for the 2014 and 2016 games
8002088 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets

8002096 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8002097 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8002098 theres a lot of guys that can hit it on the driving range
8002099 but youve got to go out and hit it on the first tee and hit it down the middle
8002100 so weve been on the driving range now were going to get on the first tee and see how we play and see how the guys respond when we turn on the lights and put a lot of people in the stands and put this game on national television
8002101 weve tried to put them in as many situations as we possibly could that would simulate a game day atmosphere
8002102 at the same token you cant put all the people in the seats and you cant televise it and you cant add the drama that builds during the week of preparation
8002103 i think the differences between coordinators will come on game day with what they see in terms of what the defense is doing and changing the scheme or how they adapt during halftime
8002104 weve gone back and weve studied things that theyve done throughout the course of their careers
8002105 obviously mikes played a little bit cobb hasnt played any at the college level but weve seen what he did at high school and you know you kind of make some hypotheses with what you think theyll do with mike what you think theyll do with cobb in the game
8002106 hartline being his first start ever we know theyre going to throw different blitzes at us
8002107 its our responsibility as far as this game to get up and be ready for everything
8002108 were taking it every day that the game is kind of going to ride on us
8002109 i definitely think theres a lot of pressure on the o line
8002110 but weve talked about that even since the spring we knew we had a lot of experience coming back we tried to work every day because we knew we were going to be the backbone
8002111 second scrimmage coach told us we cant have that no more so we came out and hit them in the mouth
8002112 we kind of took it upon ourselves after that first scrimmage
8002113 we knew we had to get better play together work together i think the guys just took it as a challenge everyday to get better i think we went out and really showed saturday that weve improved
8002114 the health of the line is better than it was a couple of weeks ago when i was pretty upset with them
8002115 the focus was really on us but like i said we came out we were a focused unit we knew we had to get better we had to improve
8002116 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8002117 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8002118 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8002119 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8002120 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8002121 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8002122 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8002123 they need food its not torture but they must come out
8002124 i must be the only republican who thinks michelle obama did a good job maybe its the estrogen
8002125 no doubt shes very liberal but the intro video and speech were moving to me the family moment after was awkward though
8002126 i suspect some mothers will wonder why michelle didnt take control
8002127 a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
8002128 mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
8002129 michelle obama has me in tears with her speech at the dnc
8002130 why are people crying at the democratic national convention during michelle obamas speech crying
8002131 i think only the chinese olympic ceremonies were more staged than michelle obamas speech especially the mtv style satellite phone in
8002132 barack on big screen talking to michelle live a reprise of ronald reagan waving to nancy in 1984 if memory serves
8002133 america is a mean country in my adult life ive never been proud to be an american until now

8002135 they told clay there would always be a seat at the kelley school of business with his name on it
8002136 honestly when i heard it it was just two or three days after the crash
8002137 i needed to stay home to be close to my family and be there for my mom and family
8002138 there was a warm mutual handshake you could feel it he was very interested in wanting to be here
8002139 i couldnt even believe he was taking time to meet me
8002140 he fit transylvanias profile of an outstanding well rounded student
8002141 you let him know that youre there but that he will not be treated differently than anybody else
8002142 he had a deep sense of personal loss and whenever you have a student like that you choose your words carefully you just try to keep an eye on them and see how theyre progressing
8002143 he did that tremendously well it was a difficult time and being treated as normal as possible helped me with my grief
8002144 theres never been a time when i thought i should bring it up or he should bring it up
8002145 i realized how much i would miss my mom and all my friends i was extremely homesick
8002146 i knew once i came back i was where people cared about me
8002147 hes been primarily in the background but hes there for clay as a mentor

8002162 a point i often hear made is that having a good windows port of inkscape will
8002163 with a low c u ratio increasing popularity may simply bring with it piles of bug reports and frustration by all involved with few new volunteers coming in existing ones risk becoming burned out and the c u ratio continues to decrease
8002164 its sort of ironic that many of us got involved in inkscape to further the aims of open source with the intent of getting people away from windows yet since there arent enough windows contributors to cover all the problems particular to that platform here we are with an expectation that we spend extra time supporting it do not want

8002169 im sure theyre laughing now because theyre like oh shoot but this was when i was 13 men now send me flowers and i like it that way
8002170 some time in the next week more than 6 million iphone 3gs will be in people s hands around the world what that means is that the second generation device has outsold the original iphone just seven weeks after going on sale they actually may already have done so
8002171 it took apple nearly a year to sell 6 million first generation iphones
8002172 according to our sources foxconn continues to build iphones for apple at the rate of 800 000 units per week with production ramping up as fast as possible

8002179 apple s success with consumers has begun to spill over into the enterprise market with mac adoption among enterprise customers increasing four fold in less than two years
8002180 mac use in businesses rose from 1 1 percent in october 2006 to 4 5 percent in june of this year according to a report by analyst benjamin gray of forrester research
8002181 an array of stubborn perceptions made the mac a pariah platform in the enterprise windows pcs were cheaper it departments didn t want to support a second platform or deal with mac windows network integration issues many disliked the mac because only one vendor manufactured it meaning no competitive bids and no replacement vendor if apple went under
8002182 well make it up in volume by exploiting the ignorant
8002183 thanks to their intel made cpus current macs can run windows xp or vista not only in a virtual environment but also natively via apple s free bootcamp utility that versatility removes much of the risk it heads associated with buying macs
8002184 apple in fact has made a play for business customers with the iphone by adding support for microsoft exchange which most businesses use to run their e mail
8002185 many executives once loyal to research in motion s blackberry now own iphones and have started pushing their it people to support it in house since the iphone runs mac os x support for macs isn t much of a leap

8002272 on est convaincus qu cause des pressions sociales des pressions politiques il va y avoir des accusations d pos es contre notre policier la seule chose quon peut lui reprocher cest davoir bien fait son travail

8002315 i was down at the solidarity camp on friday last i was walking along the waters edge with my eldest son niall with my back to the compound this garda came towards us with his arms folded and with that he shouldered my son who was carrying a video camera he kicked his left foot out at my sons foot
8002316 i think the word is barged him with his shoulders and legs
8002317 we are decent law abiding people and not troublemakers we are just a young family who loves returning to this most beautiful place in the world we have been on holidays for five weeks
8002318 i wish this never happened we are still very upset this shouldnt be happening in ireland it is a democracy and what i saw was bullying
8002319 this was the most beautiful community in the whole world in certain villages the meitheal still existed where everyone would help with the hay this is not just about splitting a community it is destroying a heritage the most untouched environment and the most wonderful people
8002320 our clients have a licence to fish for crabs in broadhaven bay they own property in the bay and make their livelihood from this we have been in communication with mccann fitzgerald shells solicitors and asked them to undertake not to interfere with our clients property
8002321 neither of these documents is a legal basis for interfering with my clients pots we have not had any legal basis cited to us
8002322 it is my understanding that i am protected by the law but i have been advised to stay close to my gear
8002323 everybody concerned should reflect on actions already taken and actions that are possibly being considered this is a very volatile time with construction on sea and the protests moving to sea protestors should take a step back
8002324 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
8002325 the high rate of inflation has put a spanner in the works of good economic growth
8002326 if one takes a look at the financial scope of private households christmas trading is unlikely to be very impressive
8002327 nearshoring is gaining favor with many companies because they can save transportation costs and get faster delivery times by sourcing components and finished products in the u s rather than in asia or other distant countries
8002328 bonny was just fur and bones she was totally emaciated she was like in a coma
8002329 i had to look after her like a baby at first i fed and washed her she got better each day and i hope shell have fully recovered in a few weeks
8002330 a fund like this saves me time my most valuable resource
8002331 the mix of the fund matches the evolution of my financial needs
8002332 the track records of target date funds are not that long
8002333 we try to overweight sectors that will benefit from long term trends in supply and demand
8002334 we try to focus on stocks that are not dependent on a favorable stock market or a robust bond market
8002335 so youre saying that your test can detect those conditions
8002336 please respect his familys grief and privacy at this time
8002337 we are falling behind other states in terms of the money allocated to venture capital and start ups
8002338 we want to make sure legislators and members of the illinois general assembly understand what venture capital is this is money we are going to invest anyway we are using it in a manner to spur economic growth
8002339 i dont think we should be making brand new accounts for technology investments
8002340 the treasurer already has a technology account we have to have better information about the success of that before we get into a whole new venture
8002341 some of the problems have less to do with the pure merits of the legislation than the current structural problems the state is having
8002342 you dont try to pick kernels out of the manure you shut down the executive branch
8002343 i spent several years researching this book using an enormous body of documentation and im not about to denounce it just because it upsets a few people
8002344 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits
8002345 i think its just very sad that its come to this stage that when you write about certain topics in new zealand history you get complaints and accusations of racism levelled at you
8002346 hes looked at no maori language evidence nothing from the maori land court he sets that all aside and makes a giant sized conclusion about pre european maori society thats based on the view of a few europeans
8002347 this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens
8002348 matthew mitchum i was hoping to meet him but maybe the guys are gay or married
8002349 i dont think i have much advice for marriage obviously
8002350 ill give you my number just give me a call
8002351 we are working with airlines right now to ensure everything works as efficiently as possible
8002352 demos political con hype spin amp bunkum for the masses
8002353 let us stop the spiral of fear give peace and dialogue a chance
8002354 one can only take our republic away from us by killing us
8002355 shame on georgia and its supporters like the traitor sanakoyev
8002356 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8002357 we apologise for any offense that is caused by the title
8002358 selected it to highlight one of the novels major themes racism
8002359 the solution is not to force the artist to alter her work but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion
8002360 luckily i remembered that jaimie gave me the authorization before
8002361 they said let me see it and i gave it to them and they took it from me
8002362 i try to do as much as i can for the comfort of my children
8002363 even if it is only a few hours of tv
8002364 i asked public works if they would let me stay in one of them since these ones are unsafe and they dont want me to stay here anymore but i have never heard anything back from them other than that they say they dont have any money
8002365 i dont know why theyre making an issue out of this
8002366 theyre saying were illegal here how can we be illegal when everybody here went through a legal procedure
8002367 where can we go if we all get evicted out of here
8002368 we dont want to all wind up in a tent city at nimitz beach
8002369 i have instructed my staff in the interest of safety of the public and in the interest of limiting or avoiding any liability to the government of guam to compose eviction notices for my signature
8002370 very confident that there are no contracts out there that have not expired
8002371 if they want to make an agreement with the people that live around here why doesnt the director come down here and negotiate with the people who live around here instead of evicting us
8002372 what are we going to do if they kick us out
8002373 every time we would ask to have something repaired here jaimie would say that they didnt have any funding no materials no tools
8002374 theres been so much food on this course offerings from ruths chris koutouki lux il portico etc at each hole
8002375 we should skip dinner and go straight to the auction
8002376 what we are doing is bringing everyone together with the same level of commitment
8002377 anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with senator obama
8002378 i respect what clintons saying i have a different path to unity
8002379 going to tell us to vote for obama its not up to her to convince me to vote for obama its up to obama to do this
8002380 well wait for north korea to produce this verification package so that we can move on to the next steps
8002381 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015
8002382 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8002383 china managed to reduce poverty in the last 30 years because of market oriented reform there are lessons here for other developing countries
8002384 we first heard about it late monday when the injured started to arrive to medical centres in la paz and el alto
8002385 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8002386 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
8002387 both hamas and fatah are invited to these separate talks
8002388 discussions tackled the presence of egyptian advisors in gaza for security reasons only
8002389 egypt chose the islamic jihad to start the talks because of its balanced relationship with all other palestinian factions
8002390 egypt has shown a genuine will to bridge the internal palestinian gap
8002391 greater efforts are however needed to reconcile the splits especially between fatah and hamas
8002392 this is not an act that will be recognized by the un security council it will be dead on arrival
8002393 nearly half the adult population of eastern democratic republic of congo drc has faced death threats suffered beatings or has been enslaved by armed groups according to a new survey undertaken in the region one third of the 2 620 people interviewed reported having been abducted for a week or more yet a large majority 85 of the population believe that those responsible for the violence must be held accountable
8002394 living with fear a population based survey on attitudes about peace justice and social reconstruction in eastern democratic republic of the congo
8002395 the speaker is the mother of five children and seven grandchildren and fully appreciates the sanctity of family she was raised in a devout catholic family who often disagreed with her pro choice views
8002396 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8002397 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8002398 the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8002399 this is about good enough for a good snack so thats my catch for today
8002400 reminds me of what jack told ben that locke as bentham told him before kicking the bucket
8002401 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
8002402 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
8002403 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
8002404 we wanted to find a way to be a part of this event in a non political way
8002405 this grew to something far beyond what we ever envisioned it would be
8002406 we thought wed have a couple of video games in here with some drinks and snacks
8002407 when we started serving this past saturday some of the officers were still a little hesitant about us they thought we were hired caterers
8002408 but when they learned we were church volunteers their whole tenor changed
8002409 were southern baptists and were doing it because we love jesus and you
8002410 are very appreciative of what were doing one told me all they usually get in their break room at an event like this is a power bar and maybe an energy drink
8002411 weve learned that its not easy for many of these individuals to get involved in a church
8002412 they never feel like they can relax in a public setting they are never off duty so making a personal connection is a very important first step with them and thats what we are doing all this week
8002413 we live with an urgency because weve both had cancer and we know time is limited
8002414 this was a chance for us to show the love of christ and hopefully point some people toward the lord
8002415 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner paula wagner and united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of us 11 million
8002416 we are grateful to the beihoff music fund for giving us this opportunity to further advance our music program
8002417 and we are very excited to offer our students the chance to work with this state of the art music technology
8002418 i think that maybe lauren is tired of being on the hills but were just beginning
8002419 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
8002420 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
8002421 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
8002422 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
8002423 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
8002424 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
8002425 while southern baptist pastors are united in their view of the inerrancy of scripture they must be aware that 1 out of 4 people who attend their churches each month consider the bible less than totally accurate or authoritative
8002426 its really sad to see the way that a lot of our people are living in our own back yard here
8002427 we put a tarp over it in an attempt to prevent any further water from entering the house
8002428 at least we know weve done the best we could do
8002429 i could see why she had to get out of there
8002430 there was a gas leak and the place was being flooded
8002431 the man didnt even know it and people were in there smoking the place could have gone up in flames we are just doing our best to try and help
8002432 i cant stand up and preach in front of a bunch of people id rather be doing this
8002433 while it never developed into a hurricane it did a lot of damage the state has been fairly hard hit
8002434 today we are getting a better picture of what we need to do
8002435 this strategy gives us the structure and clear line of communications we have needed along with the delivery system and trained volunteers to make our response immediate and more effective
8002436 we will be housing volunteers at a brevard county church if needed
8002437 and using local feeding volunteers to prepare meals for our folks
8002438 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
8002439 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
8002440 in six months than he had in years toiling over embryonic stem cells
8002441 the largest source of funding for embryonic and pluripotent stem cell research in the world
8002442 it appears that the cirms love affair with slow inefficient expensive ethically fraught and legally complex human embryonic stem cells may be drawing to a close
8002443 it may not yet be a full fledged exodus but it would appear that the tide has changed dramatically
8002444 if this continues and it becomes clear that the tide is irreversibly flowing toward ipscs the political ability to create an international ban on human cloning with the catcalls of cures cures cures to distract leaders from doing the right thing will increase we may actually be able to throttle human cloning before it gets too far out of the test tube
8002445 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
8002446 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
8002447 we are delighted to announce that all of the 14 buildings will be ready by september
8002448 our 10 year plan for replacing our student housing has become a six month plan construction has proceeded ahead of schedule and we are grateful to god for providing for us in this way it is truly overwhelming to think about where we were on feb 6 and where we are now
8002449 this is highly unusual to complete a project of this magnitude as quickly as we have
8002450 as i sit back and analyze whats happened i think unions need is what motivated the response everybody has had a total commitment and a passion to make sure that the job was completed by sept 1
8002451 i think that people have a lot greater appreciation for each other and even for the material things
8002452 i think there will be an attitude of thankfulness and rejoicing
8002453 you learn from mistakes but its better to avoid them
8002454 importantes da os en la sala de turbinas y en la galer a subterr nea que hay bajo ella
8002455 el gobierno tiene que cerrar de una vez todas las centrales nucleares como se comprometi a hacerlo el jefe del gobierno espa ol jos luis rodr guez zapatero en su campa a electoral
8002456 como la persona que pod a liderar a nuestro pa s
8002457 ella impresion a las multitudes y estaba totalmente comprometida a tomar el desaf o pol tico de tratar con el r gimen militar
8002458 hizo un gran trabajo para ayudar a la gente a entender lo que significaba la democracia y se atrevi a hablarle al ej rcito y enfrentar al entonces dictador general ne win
8002459 la gente las escuchaba una y otra vez se empez a hablar de que birmania tendr a su segunda independencia
8002460 cuando regres a birmania en 1988 para cuidar a mi madre enferma ten a planeado abrir una cadena de bibliotecas en nombre de mi padre no me atra a una vida en la pol tica
8002461 pero los habitantes de mi pa s clamaban por democracia y como hija de mi padre sent que ten a el deber de involucrarme
8002462 se ha convertido en un punto de reuni n para el movimiento democr tico en birmania ha contribuido enormemente al crecimiento de la cultura democr tica en los ltimos 20 a os
8002463 su lucha ha puesto en el mapa mundial los problemas pol ticos y el sufrimiento de birmania
8002464 eso tambi n se aplica a todo el movimiento democr tico birmano perder su oportunidad si ella no est
8002465 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8002466 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8002467 has now chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
8002468 this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarrding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
8002469 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace in the caucasus
8002470 trying to legalize the result of an ethnic cleansing that it has conducted but it will result in russias isolation from the rest of the world
8002471 indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
8002472 tenemos un m ximo n mero de cr menes y una cantidad masiva de criminales
8002473 se viene adelantado un complot contra la corte suprema de justicia para desacreditar a sus magistrados y para deslegitimar las denuncias
8002474 sobre la forma en que se est comenzando a absolver
8002475 la coalici n de gobierno est integrada por partidos que desde su direcci n casi todos han estado comprometidos en la parapol tica tienen involucrados en procesos a sus presidentes y comprometidos ya sea enjuiciados o en la c rcel entre 30 y 70 por ciento de sus votos
8002476 una coalici n de gobierno que ha obtenido participaci n en el poder desde la violencia son corresponsables de los cr menes atroces por los cuales se est n juzgando a los paramilitares
8002477 c mo se va a garantizar la no impunidad y cu l es la obligaci n de reparaci n de los parapol ticos que contribuyeron a asesinatos masacres y al desplazamiento forzado de m s de tres millones de personas en colombia
8002478 c mo se asegurar el juzgamiento de los m ximos responsables de cr menes que estar an bajo la competencia de la cpi incluyendo a dirigentes pol ticos y miembros del congreso legislativo presuntamente vinculados a grupos desmovilizados
8002479 la parapol tica es un tema central para nosotros porque los m ximos responsables deben ser juzgados y condenados
8002480 que se hicieron utilizando mecanismos de presi n armada y de control territorial que pueden ser vinculados a cr menes de lesa humanidad
8002481 la parapol tica es el frente esencial de la lucha hoy aqu en colombia
8002482 no hay mal que por bien no venga estos resultados pueden abrir los ojos de mucha gente sobre lo que est ocurriendo con el deporte en el pa s
8002483 hubo problemas evidentes con los entrenamientos en algunas disciplinas atletas que no llegaron a su m ximo nivel f sico y otros que demostraron falta de preparaci n psicol gica en los momentos claves
8002484 cada disciplina cada recurso humano y material que dedicamos al deporte
8002485 debemos ser profundos en los an lisis aplicar nuevas ideas conceptos y conocimientos
8002486 a fondo y de forma verdaderamente democr tica sobre la responsabilidad de todos los que tienen que ver con el deporte cubano
8002487 fue criminal lo que hicieron con los j venes de nuestro equipo de boxeo para complementar el trabajo de los que se dedican a robar atletas del tercer mundo
8002488 hay que mejorar la calidad de nuestra serie nacional campeonato nacional revisar nuestros m todos de selecci n y entrenamiento alinear con quienes lo est n haciendo mejor y reducir la presi n que colocamos todos sobre nuestros peloteros jugadores de b isbol y directores cuestionados en cada movimiento en cada decisi n
8002489 se ha mezclado mucho la pol tica con el deporte y eso ha a adido presi n adicional a los atletas en particular a los peloteros
8002490 de batear en el momento oportuno o hacer un remate para obtener la victoria no puede depender la gloria del pa s como si cada competencia fuera un campo de batalla
8002491 not even an inch more of land necessary for the project has been acquired we are willing to show respect to the opposition and sit for relevant discussions but not for talks that are irrelevant and illogical
8002492 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
8002493 ive made a major investment here to move will be at a great cost to tata motors and to shareholders
8002494 ratan tata has two options if he moves out of west bengal he will either retain the selling price and delay the project by six or seven months or he might sell the nano at a higher price
8002495 banks from all over europe are pushing into the german market but many german banks arent seizing their opportunities to grow in foreign markets
8002496 thats a major burden which is weighing heavily on the negotiations
8002497 commerzbank is financially well positioned at the moment and allianz has so far failed to earn profits with dresdner bank so the pressure for a sale is intense
8002498 they have to reach an agreement quickly or the deal could fail once again
8002499 es escandaloso que nuestros aportes inflen el salario de los ejecutivos
8002500 en estos atribulados tiempos econ micos podr amos encontrar seguramente mecanismos mejores para gastar la riqueza de nuestra naci n
8002501 los ataques bipartidistas contra la fuga de dinero son alentadores pero si los candidatos hablan en serio deber an comprometerse con tapar todo vac o legal que permita que nuestros pagos de impuestos fluyan al bolsillo de los altos ejecutivos
8002502 i have signed the decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8002503 russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8002504 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8002505 this spring one could still have been certain that the kremlin would not be drawn into the fatal step of recognizing independence one can no longer be sure a justifiable decision to come to the aid of an attacked neighbor has turned into a case of geopolitical land reallocation
8002506 russia can only lose in the long term its state tv might like to dismiss the international threats with macho gestures but an isolated russia cannot prosper either politically or economically the recognition of the rebel provinces would show other caucasus peoples who have only been pacified with much effort that separatism does actually pay and russia is forcing nato and perhaps also the eu into a united position that moscow would usually have tried to prevent no one knows how far russia will really go for abkhazia and south ossetia recognition would be the wrong move however making mistakes is not something that is unique to russia the precedent of kosovo is now russias best argument
8002507 one can now bet that georgias two breakaway provinces will become independent in the not too distant future their first official act may well be their last it is quite possible that the abkhazians and ossetians will ask to join russia
8002508 the europeans would be powerless to stop this and they should admit that openly instead they are trying to hide their lack of influence with a lot of empty phrases russian president dmitry medvedev is unlikely to be swayed by this moscow has never been impressed by the criticism of world opinion whether it be prague spring or mass murder in chechnya only one threat would sway the last colonial power on the european continent to change its policies a military display of strength however no one in europe wants to or is in the position to go to war against the nuclear power russia on behalf of georgia are we prepared to do so for nato members estonia lithuania or latvia
8002509 one thing is clear russia is anxious to recover the soviet unions lost power under these circumstances the germans would be well advised to finally end their debate about getting rid of military conscription
8002510 western politicians would be better off holding back on the cries of indignation and instead react calmly because the parliamentary vote changes nothing russia has long nominally recognized its separatist neighbors and despite paying lip service to the territorial integrity of georgia through years of passivity the west has got used to the idea of the breakup of the caucasus republic
8002511 it would not only be ridiculous but also counterproductive to want to isolate russia the global scarcity of natural resources and the resulting high prices have turned russia into an economic superpower the country was still a great power militarily and politically because of its veto power on the un security council and its nuclear weapons arsenal one cannot isolate great powers they are always required as major players without russia there would be no diffusing the worlds most dangerous trouble spots no solution for afghanistan iran iraq north korea or pakistan if the situation there gets more serious
8002512 the west will get further if it stops considering russia as a bear that has gone wild and instead sees it as a political and increasingly an economic competitor for influence and markets russia has great aims and also great problems that it cannot master alone
8002513 the independence of a tiny statelet like south ossetia will mean nothing other than its eventual annexation by moscow
8002514 therefore politicians from the eu and the us were right to protest against the dumas resolution if medvedev goes along with the parliamentarians vote then russia will have created a legitimization for the annexation of part of another state
8002515 nevertheless the resolution is a clever piece of gamesmanship the fact that russia will control abkhazia and south ossetia is a scandal but it is not a new scandal the georgian central government had already lost control of the breakaway territories in the early 1990s moscows recognition will only cement this reality
8002516 a protracted dispute with russia over the status of the provinces will only be a waste of energy it is far more important that moscow should be made to stick to the peace plan that it has signed the current situation which sees russia trying to control georgia proper has to end as soon as possible the government in tbilsi will only be able to start work on reconstruction when it has control over the country there is no point in trying to negotiate with russia about anything if it wont even stick to the current agreement
8002517 when the russian troops have pulled back to the separatist areas then the georgian leadership will see that they have lost these regions for ever they can complain about this situation but they wont be able to do anything to change it however they can still make their country into a model of success something they had already begun to do before the war the eu should help them to achieve this
8002518 russia is preparing itself for the endgame in the caucasus with the call by the russian upper and lower house for dmitry medvedev to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia the president has a new trump card for his negotiations with the west
8002519 medvedev would do well to wait if he were to create the facts on the ground unilaterally then russias relationship with the west would be further damaged the voices in the eu that are still arguing for a compromise with russia would become much quieter the country would have maneuvered itself further into no mans land
8002520 politicians in the eu and the us must realize that the chances of reintegrating the two provinces into georgia have become much slimmer the split was there before the war at least in abkhazia the virtual separation from georgia in the 90s has seen the establishment of a political system which despite the dependence on russia could form the basis for independence these are facts that the west should not be allowed to disregard the stubborn insistence on georgias territorial integrity may be correct in the face of the russian armys presence in georgia proper however it doesnt help in dealing with the future of the two disputed territories
8002521 moscow can have no interest in further escalation medvedev must realize that a growing confrontation with the west could be costly for russia despite all its oil billions and energy resources the country may seem strong after its military victory however it still has all the old domestic problems an ailing infrastructure inflation corruption legal uncertainties and a lopsided economic dependency on the export of natural resources russia can certainly hold out as a fortress for some time however if medvedev and putin want to prepare their country for global competition then they will require international cooperation
8002522 in the light of the various nationality conflicts within russia it would seem a law of nature that moscow would have no interest in the example that the secession of the restive provinces of georgia could provide however the kremlin is creating its own precedent with its tanks in georgia whoever does not listen to moscow will be occupied
8002523 the west has also been given a lesson the reconstruction of the russian sphere of influence is more important to moscows dual leadership than maintaining the strategic partnership nato and the eu still have no concept about what to do should russia reemerge as an aggressive power that does not consider peaceful dialogue with the west to be a priority
8002524 the european union should take what is happening in the caucasus very seriously because russia is playing with fire in a dangerous way in an unstable region brussels will only be able to deal with russias thirst for power in its old sphere of influence if it acts decisively the eu has to offer neighboring russia closer cooperation if it wants this the examples of the neglected ukraine and forgotten abkhazia show exactly how things should not be done
8002525 like its arch enemy georgia abkhazia is looking across to the black sea toward the eu economic aid and a willingness on the part of the eu to recognize abkhazias independence would diffuse the conflict between the region and georgia and at the same time would force russia to step back and be moderate unlike south ossetia abkahzia is viable and has long realized that russia is no soft power
8002526 i see this nation differently than i did 10 months ago
8002527 that this travesty was committed by the democratic party has forever changed my approach to politics
8002528 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
8002529 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
8002530 that the winter of discontent in politics had come for women
8002531 the american womans movement and her interest in great moral and social questions is splintered into a hundred fragments under as many warring leaders
8002532 the feminist movement is dying of partial victory and inanition

8002572 it is possible to discuss how to make a law and establish a system later but we expected the president to apologize and punish those involved immediately we understand todays statement by the government as meaning that we have to keep rallying to denounce the government

8002574 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
8002575 by naming his senate colleague joe biden as his running mate obama has sent out the signal that he needs help
8002576 the 65 year old biden has unassailable familiarity with the political process to offer which should calm the nerves of many who have doubts about obama from the opening bell biden would be able to fulfil the demands of the presidential office and despite all his years in washington biden has never lost contact with the party base white voters in small town america although obama really needs these voters to win the election he still hasnt succeeded in wooing them in this sense naming biden is a clever move and the best thing that obama could have done
8002577 choosing joe biden as his running mate is not without its problems obama is a candidate with some roots in kenya whos grown up in indonesia and far off hawaii and an african american who for years felt at ease among radicals with a bent toward african identity politics now he has decided to pull to his side someone from the senate foreign relations committee a panel which has gained the reputation on the far side of the appalachian mountains of constantly tripping up the president on national security issues in the minds of the voters joe biden is just as much as a blank slate as obama is in america thats what you call double trouble naming biden doesnt mitigate peoples stranger anxiety with obama it actually accentuates it
8002578 by deciding on biden as his running mate obama has made it clear that he considers his lack of foreign policy experience to be dangerous and that given the current global situation it might even be decisive in the election otherwise its very unlikely that he would have chosen biden as he represents a tiny state and neither he nor obama enjoys general popularity with the common citizen bidens own runs for the presidency have usually ended fairly early with extremely poor results will biden be able to bring the white middle class voters who will decide the election over to obama in sufficient numbers with biden obama is trying to cover up an exposed flank
8002579 obama will have to deal with the fact that critics will now say that joe biden the washington insider is no symbol of change but in the long run joe biden might just be exactly the right guy there is hardly anyone more familiar with washington politics than biden having served as a senator for over three decades biden knows how the game is played in the capital and obama needs seasoned players on his team
8002580 if biden makes it to the white house it would be a good thing for europe too biden is a frequent guest in european capitals and hes seen the problem spots with his own eyes with biden obama is putting a specialist on his team in a time of foreign policy crisis that can only help the occasionally troubled trans atlantic relations

8002602 every album is different from each other and each metallica album has its own personality some songs in this album are really amazing for me a great album is an album that needs a couple of listens to get into it and this is what happens with this one i like death magnetic but i still dont know how much i like it its really dynamic and very detailed it feels alive we recorded the album as if we were playing a live show standing up while recording and it was was the first time i recorded an album this way when you listen to the album you feel the metallica past is still alive i really love master of puppets and i dont know how can we compete with the classic albums but its a great album with its own personality and with lots of great moments the feel of the album is that its like a whole like a pink floyd album not only a bunch of songs put all together anyway in the end its up to the people to decide if its good or not
8002603 we decided that for many reasons and rick rubin has something to do with this

8002616 the greatest of all philosophers aristotle did not regard ethics as an exact science he based his ethical system on observations of what the noble and wise men of his time chose to do leaving unanswered the questions of why they chose to do it and why he evaluated them as noble and wise
8002617 the wise man knows all things in the way that it is possible thought he does not have knowledge of them as particulars next we assume that the one who is able to know things that are difficult and not easy for a human being to know is wise for perceiving is common to everyone for which reason it is an easy thing and nothing wise further we assume the one who has more precision and is more able to teach the causes is wise concerning each kind of knowledge and among the kinds of knowledge we assume the one that is for its own sake and chosen for the sake of knowing more to be wisdom than the one chosen for the sake of results and that the more ruling one is wisdom more so than the more subordinate one for the wise man ought not to be commanded but to give orders and ought not to obey someone else but the less wise ought to obey him
8002618 the wise man accordingly is considered to know 1 all things as far as possible though not having a particular knowledge of each 2 difficult things 3 with more exact knowledge 4 in such a way as to be able to teach the causes 5 for the sake of knowledge 6 not to serve but to command

8002692 en quoi le fait d tre organis en groupe de pression rend un point de vue valable
8002693 donc pour moi il y a de fait un arbitre la morale lhistoire nest en aucun cas arbitre lhistoire ne permet que de dire qui est vainqueur et qui est vaincu mais certainement pas qui a l v lhumanit et qui la rabaiss
8002694 la relativit nexiste t il que lorsque lon passe dune morale lautre
8002695 les droits de lhomme et du citoyen de 1789 proposent une morale lonu propose une morale accepter larbitrage par de tels textes ou organisation cest accepter une forme de morale universelle que certains points de vue visent tre universels ne veut pas dire quils le sont cela souligne simplement leur vis e imp rialiste tout le monde naccepte pas luniversalisme dont vous parlez autrement il ny aurait pas tout ce bordel qui succ de la morale universelle du christianisme et de lislam ce nest donc pas relatif
8002696 mais je ne crois pas que dire que tous les points de vue apporte la paix apr s tout si tous les points de vue se valent on devra admettre que le point de vue b lliqueux et belliciste des uns vaudra le point de vue pacifiste et ouvert des autres

8002702 i will not discuss anything outside of my mourning and sympathy for the upshaw family vincent wrote in an e mail sent to the associated press on tuesday in what were the former nflpa presidents first public comments since upshaw died last week
8002703 i struggled to find the words to articulate my appreciation for the experience of working intimately with one of the greatest union leaders in history vincent wrote
8002704 all who made sacrifices to advance the cause of the players
8002705 genes words and invaluable lessons as a man and mentor will live on in my life
8002706 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8002707 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8002708 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8002709 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8002710 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8002711 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8002712 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8002713 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8002714 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8002715 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8002716 if we win ill go down as having the lowest iq of any genius who ever lived
8002717 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning i can tell you that
8002718 it would have been very difficult to know what to do
8002719 our chief concern is that we never underestimate an opponent stewart said tuesday
8002720 because theres going to be crunch time in every game
8002721 i told the team i didnt want them to feel any pressure because i want them to be loose in every game
8002722 the trip out west to play in that january bowl game was just about the bowl game
8002723 a long time ago as a little kid i learned that the most lasting impression is your first impression so this needs to be a big first impression
8002724 i hope i remain the same guy ive got a nice bride at home whos going to make sure i dont crow too much and i got a 13 year old son who keeps me in line and friends in the business that wont let me forget who i am
8002725 we know were going to have to play our best game to be in the game
8002726 hopefully we can get this game into the fourth quarter with a manageable score
8002727 were going to face adversity over the course of the season
8002728 i think this group has a little chip on their shoulder because it feel like theyve been cast off as also rans and it may very well be that thats what come to pass
8002729 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself
8002730 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8002731 a tremendous athlete someone whos willing to learn hes humble now
8002732 we had to show him a little bit that this is a different level and everybody starts from the bottom he said
8002733 the seniors must get after him pretty good because every once in a while ill get a text from him saying are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me tressel said
8002734 maybe some of those guys should be our coaches the fifth year senior cracked
8002735 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
8002736 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
8002737 they the government have the resources but they are slow in investing them

8002740 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8002741 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8002742 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8002743 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8002744 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8002745 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8002746 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8002747 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8002748 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8002749 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8002750 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8002751 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8002752 we need in the white house starting on jan 20 barack obama and joe biden
8002753 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8002754 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8002755 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8002756 are upper paleolithic blade cores more productive than middle paleolithic discoidal cores a replication experiment
8002757 its not a better technology its just a different technology
8002758 that might not go over too well in the hall but blahblahblah
8002759 for some reason that story doesnt seem to be an example of why
8002760 the government has made it clear that no option has been ruled in or out we cannot exclude that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
8002761 show that the government has learnt nothing from its disastrous referendum campaign
8002762 another referendum on lisbon without any response to the concerns of the irish people would be rejected

8002775 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8002776 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8002777 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8002778 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say
8002779 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8002780 i had this psychic feeling that i would have something to do with this woman i always listened to her and her voice made my hair stand on end i was drawn to her
8002781 then i read her biography she had been raped her brother was killed by the mafia her father was psychologically abusive and had her committed i called my office and said if i ever wanted to do a movie this would be it

8002796 we think theyre protecting them from the rest of the crowd
8002797 my delegate has already been interviewed by two other people
8002798 the funny thing is what celebrities the cable people are
8002799 ive seen dan rather and im looking for keith olbermann
8002800 it may be naive but i hadnt thought about what a convention a little c convention it is
8002801 the coverage focuses on the issues and the big players
8002802 you forget theres 5 000 fairly normal people in there theyre just doing the thing because they love it
8002803 ive never see a city turn itself around for such a major event
8002804 the city talks a lot about how they had a convention 100 years ago and that was the 50th anniversary of the city
8002805 the people of washington could not be more surprised if fidel castro came loping across the midwestern prairie on the back of a hippopotamus
8002806 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8002807 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

8002811 we have seen champ perform amazingly at both cdc4 and i33 but at both aef and tex he was not near past performances i have had talks with champ about this and it has come clear that he needs a break from the high level of gaming until he has once again found the sparkle that made him one of the best snipers in europe
8002812 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8002813 the services of the current team are no longer needed and said team shall cease to perform services related to the sewer debt
8002814 college students with limited access to alcohol tend to overconsume when given the opportunity to drink
8002815 as students inexperienced with drinking are thrust into an environment with an alcohol culture
8002816 this alone makes it more difficult and then add on that not every 18 year old knows someone who is old enough to purchase that will do so willingly for them
8002817 the more roadblocks you put in someones path the less likely they are to obtain alcohol and at the least they will be able to obtain it less frequently
8002818 eligibility for compulsory military service should also make one eligible for the same privileges as others

8002820 name one good reason to allow people to consume mcdonalds big macs or burger king whoppers
8002821 the real question should be what are the benefits if any of a 21 year old drinking age
8002822 900 lives annually have been saved since the drinking age was raised to 21
8002823 i heard discussions on the radio about lowering the drinking age on military bases because if you can fire a gun vote for a president why cant you be responsible enough to drink
8002824 if you are old enough to die you are old enough to drink
8002825 turnover is unfortunately going to occur from time to time
8002826 mayfaire continues to grow and we are confident that the strong interest in business will continue
8002827 i really hate to see artisan go it was one of my favorite restaurants
8002828 its just too many obstacles at mayfaire to overcome really
8002829 i had a good business but just couldnt keep up with everything going on at mayfaire to be honest it was supposed to be an upscale retail center but its just not enough to bring the people there i dont think
8002830 i couldnt compete with that big operation with better pricing and much more selection
8002831 i pleaded with them over and over to help me with the rent but i got a flat no every time
8002832 i think most of our problems dealt with decisions that mayfaire felt they needed to make they sort of worked against us
8002833 its a shame when a local person invests everything theyve got into a restaurant that people love and should have been considered an asset to mayfaire but its big business nobodys an asset its just another space

8002845 we won the state championship my freshman and senior seasons
8002846 i was named all region in both basketball and football i was a three year letterman in basketball football and track
8002847 i say my speed 4 6 and my instincts i am smart about the game and i know how to play
8002848 i led all of our linebackers in tackles and i started every game my freshman year we got to the pilgrame pride bowl against navarro cc tx and lost
8002849 i have been offered by tennessee south carolina ole miss marshall east carolina and minnesota
8002850 it is more tennessee and south carolina and then i still have ole miss and east carolina still up there too i really do not have any favorites but i am attracted to those schools i went on an unofficial visit to tennessee and i am taking an official visit to south carolina september 12th because they are close by
8002851 the stadium was definitely a plus they have nice facilities and i got to hang out with a couple of their players it is a nice atmosphere
8002852 first basically i have never been up there but i like south carolina because it is close to home they also have a lot of people from my school who go there they talk real good about south carolina one of my friends from camden county deangelo smith got an offer from them he is my girlfriends cousin
8002853 i am in the middle of setting up an official visit with them too i just know they put patrick willis in the league and he is doing really well in the pros my coach is also good friends with their linebacker coach tyrone nix they went to school together i have spoken a few times with coach nix and he seems like a cool coach they wanted me to come in for an unofficial visit this summer but it was too far for me to pay so i am going to let them bring in for an official visit
8002854 these are unbalanced times and great change is needed to be included in this celebration of the dignity and freedom of women and minorities is an honor
8002855 i think theres going to be a steady drip drip drip of bad news
8002856 weve only seen the very tip of the iceberg in terms of bank failures
8002857 i fully expect the fdic insurance fund to be depleted
8002858 the fdic is going to be one of what is going to be an increasing string of government bailouts
8002859 its obvious to anyone who is following these numbers that our banking system is very weak right now
8002860 how long will it be before this clears up it could be another year at least
8002861 i dont think we will see a huge number of bank failures but undoubtedly as government oversight intensifies and capital requirements have to be met some banks will be in trouble
8002862 probably between 10 and 25 small mostly regional banks are treading water right now
8002863 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
8002864 25 000 for equipment telecom services and food for those stationed inside the xcel center
8002865 as sen john mccain comes to an end in his search for a running mate there are new indications today that he is looking at minnesota gov tim pawlenty and not foe turned pal mitt romney sources close to romney tell us that his camp has not had vice presidential talks and dealings for a while leading them to believe that the other running mate topping mccains list has edged him out

8002871 all on me to own the l a marathon and screw it up is a monumental failure
8002872 an important civic asset that has the potential to have an even greater positive impact on the city of los angeles because of its great potential i am evaluating the opportunity along with going the distance
8002873 we respect the value of the asset that theyve built over time but look forward to working with a new team to bring the l a marathon to the next level
8002874 a great civic asset that managed properly can create great value for the city of los angeles
8002875 we intend to create that value not only for runners but for sponsors affiliates and the city
8002876 the los angeles marathon could attract more runners visitors and corporate sponsors from around the world it could stimulate economic activity boost local tax revenue and benefit community and non profit organizations dedicated to youth fitness and health
8002877 nobody is more dissatisfied with the pace of this deal than i am because ive got my hard earned money tied up in it
8002878 a major requirement of the hana financial group was to select a standards based authentication solution the actividentity mini token was selected as it complies with the oath open standard providing compatibility with 3rd party software and assurance of future proofing as industry requirements move over time

8002911 in the first half hull city showed why they are a premier league side
8002912 probably we gave too much respect and were a bit cagey and we paid the price
8002913 the reaction we had in the second half was very pleasing we controlled the game against the premier league side which shows you everything
8002914 gorka pintado could have had a hat trick and i thought it was a fantastic night of football

8002941 this makes the distribution of income more important economically and politically
8002942 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
8002943 literally employers were hiring workers they might not hire in normal economic times
8002944 we havent seen those days for the last eight years

8002952 in the face of this inevitable withdrawal what can we do to foster political reconciliation in iraq
8002953 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
8002954 the us may be reaping some of the consequences of exaggerating the real progress in iraqi security forces both iraqi and us politicians now seem to take such reporting too seriously and be unaware of how much still needs to be done

8003011 einen pers nlichen und multiperspektivischen bezug zur geschichte des holocaust zu entwickeln
8003012 its risky having a studio built on one franchise because if that franchise fails then everything fails the easiest thing would have been to do battlefield redressed or a clone and say its our new intellectual property we probably wouldve been quite successful but it wouldnt really be a new ip
8003013 its not that bourne doesnt use weapons but he just uses them as a means to an end and then usually dismantles them and throws them away i still wonder if we shouldve done it without any weapons whatsoever but i like giving the player the option if we get a lot of feedback from people saying theyd like a game with no weapons maybe thats what wed do for the sequel
8003014 to me it comes down to the amount of control that i have the predictability of the moves ive noticed it in games where the controls arent based around skill the game does something for you while youre running or you have a lot of outside influences on the body or car or whatever youre using but i think in mirrors edge what people dont get from the trailer and so on is how much skill is involved and how much you actually decide on your own
8003015 theres a process for sure and obviously im not privy to the process
8003016 distractions in life happen every day our key is to not react but to respond to situations that are presented to us
8003017 were going to let things play out and we just hope hes back on our team
8003018 we havent talked about it too much because we know theres really nothing we can do were going to let the whole system work it out and if it ever becomes a distraction its our job as leaders and older guys on the team to get the focus back

8003022 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8003023 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8003024 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8003025 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8003026 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8003027 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8003028 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8003029 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8003030 are very much swing voters particularly white working class voters democrats have lost them in some elections
8003031 if he engages more aggressively and in a more populist way in this economic message he has the potential to make huge inroads here
8003032 the race is not over yet the race is even among white working americans and that will continue to be a battleground until the day before the election
8003033 obama has a strong economic message but i dont think it has been heard enough in the community he needs to do more
8003034 i dont know that hes gone that far yet but well see where he goes next week
8003035 we think its really important to make sure that what we try to accomplish on election day actually gets accomplished
8003036 so we will have as many members in the field after election day as we do before election day we think the critical time is between january and june in terms of being able to move forward on critical issues such as health care for every man woman and child in america
8003037 weve said that we have his back were going to be out there making sure senators and congress members understand the critical issues they need to vote on come january february and march
8003038 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8003039 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8003040 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8003041 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8003042 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8003043 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8003044 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8003045 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8003046 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8003047 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8003068 no matter how big a check someone like google can write they are a trojan horse
8003069 if an operator shares all its customer information it will allow someone like google to come in and commoditize the most precious assets it has which is all that customer data
8003070 the good thing is that last i checked nobody s forcing anybody to buy this stuff
8003071 our official policy is not to have any political bumper stickers attatched to any department vehicles

8003078 unidrive supplies axles to car manufacturers such as ford and with the reduction in demand they are forced to let go of 40 workers from september mr dargavel said today
8003079 unidrive used to employ over 500 workers now it is 150 and after september it will reduce to 110
8003080 unidrives decision underscores the need for trade measures and industry policy that covers the entire automotive industry inclusive of component suppliers
8003081 as major car companies reduce production the demand for parts decreases and the components and subsidiary suppliers are at threat
8003082 there is a substantial growth demonstrated in automotive production around the world and significant opportunities exist for victorian manufacturing with the right mix of trade and industry policy he said

8003096 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
8003097 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
8003098 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8003099 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
8003100 despite the allegations that theres amaster disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8003101 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples

8003111 once in a lifetime the poet said once in a lifetime hope and history meet in one extraordinary man i thank the good lord that i have lived long enough to meet and help such a man twice in my lifetime john kennedy and barack obama
8003112 wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
8003113 heavenly father we pause mindful of the many blessings you have bestowed upon us we ask that you be with us at this rodeo and we pray that you will guide us in the arena of life we dont ask for special favors we dont ask to draw around a chute fightin horse or to never break a barrier nor do we ask for all daylight runs or not to draw a steer that wont lay help us lord to live our lives in such a manner that when we make that last inevitable ride to the country up there where the grass grows lush green and stirrup high and the water runs cool clear and deep that you as our last judge will tell us that our entry fees are paid
8003114 the thing that i want to hear first is that she is satisfied on behalf of us and those who sent us that the platform reflects her policy priorities if that has been improved since she campaigned then that would be a good message
8003115 remind people of why barack obama is much better than john mccain for anyone who supported her
8003116 shes going to have to help people remember what the elections about it wasnt about hillary it was about policies
8003117 thanks a lot and we need to move on to become a united party
8003118 i think we are going to hear that theme again loudly clearly and in a heartfelt way
8003119 i want her to set the tone and the future for women for our daughters for everyone for this country shes going to give us direction shes going to give us enthusiasm shes going to make sure we are a united party because this is her moment this is our moment and this is our opportunity
8003120 the same message she spoke to us at the breakfast on monday when she talked about uniting people and making sure that all of us have the same plan and i think she could do that
8003121 i know hillary for an awful long time and i think she could do that
8003122 i have not made a firm decision ive been a lifelong democrat since bobby kennedy was around ive voted straight democratic its going to be a pretty big decision
8003123 so im going to make my decision that im an american first im going to vote for whoever is the best president
8003124 could ever make me change my mind if hillary isnt the candidate to be nominated i will vote for john mccain
8003125 its true the enemy of my enemy is my friend and it seems like a lot of hillarys voters dont want to vote for barack obama so they come over to the mccain campaign
8003126 id rather vote mccain because hes the least worst of the two because at least i know what he stands on i was in search of a candidate who i could respect and support at least i know mccain respects our country
8003127 we have reconciled our minds to that but right now we want to make sure shes on the roll call she gets her due for all the work and hardship she went through she did get the popular vote she deserves to be on the roll call
8003128 mccain is too conservative hes too right wing similar tactics as bush similar policies and i dont think things are going to change enough with mccain hes going to be pretty close to what weve already had
8003129 he has the most misogynistic voting record in the senate
8003130 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8003131 this has nothing to do with whats going on now

8003142 qual dos candidatos far a mudan a que vai restaurar a promessa americana john mccain
8003143 talvez seja porque john mccain continua dizendo que as pol ticas de bush s o boas talvez porque ele aprovou 90 dos projetos enviados por bush ao senado se ele a resposta ent o a pergunta rid cula
8003144 eu tenho uma id ia melhor vamos eleger barack obama que vai restaurar a prosperidade e a nova promessa americana ele sabe as melhores estrat gias para lidar com a economia investir em infra estrutura ele vai conversar com os senadores para derrubar projetos que prejudicam os deficientes

8003149 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8003150 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8003151 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8003152 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8003153 just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husbands administration
8003154 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8003155 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8003156 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
8003157 were taking a stand and not backing down its we the people not we the dnc we are standing up for what is right i know in my heart
8003158 we found that government spending in aggregate has tracked upwards slightly over the past two years
8003159 traditionally the culture sector has been recognized for its multi faceted role in contributing to individual and community development social cohesion and quality of life
8003160 however in recent decades there has been growing understanding and examination of the substantial economic contribution of arts and cultural industries and of their central role in the creative economy
8003161 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognize that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8003162 since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide

8003164 consumers should exercise caution when purchasing health products from outside canada or over the internet as these products may not have undergone the same degree of assessment as those authorized for sale in canada
8003165 a lot of desperate consumers are looking for other options nathani said canadian consumers mainly shop in the u s
8003166 people think its a general practice but its not its not meant for everyone to be taking it
8003167 in the past centuries there was a depletion of metals in human bodies but in todays post modern society we are actually overloaded with metals
8003168 its not necessarily that kind of practice needed at this time
8003169 we dont see any countrywide drivers in china indicating a slowdown
8003170 the economic drivers remain intact both in asia and across other developing markets
8003171 both are performing well with rio possibly looking a little better for this half
8003172 short on what we consider is fair value for rio and its prospects
8003173 i was bummed that i wasnt going to get to see rage i grew up in spain and i saw them a bunch of times in the 90s when i was a kid
8003174 they were a huge influence on me musically and politically they made people question things and made people talk about how f ed up america and europes foreign policy is theyre just a massively influential band on many different levels
8003175 i walked past tom morello at a festival in sweden but he was in the middle of a heated ping pong game
8003176 he seemed pretty into it but yeah i wanted to do the whole hi youre my hero but it just wasnt the moment
8003177 the european union therefore takes the leading position its a victory for sport and for the fundamental and common values of the people of the union
8003178 the comparison of the eu against china or the us is of course not entirely fair
8003179 these people want to create a single country called europe

8003191 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
8003192 the whole concepts ridiculous and only could be put forward by somebody whos seriously out of touch with scotland who on earth would really want to jeopardize or sacrifice the future of scotland as an international football country so we could have a couple of players in an under 23 team in four years time

8003206 zoriah is a real photographer thank you zoriah for showing us the truth
8003207 your work is beyond words almost to point of emotional breakpoint
8003208 a riveting unflinching set of some of the most poignant photography ive ever come across
8003209 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo

8003211 muito muito muito com o seu trabalho meus sinceros parabens fico feliz em ver fotografos engajados com a luta dos povos beijos e fortes abra os solid rios
8003212 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
8003213 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
8003214 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
8003215 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
8003216 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
8003217 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
8003218 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
8003219 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one

8003222 your images are so profound they have so much depth and feeling attached to them i have much admiration for those who are willing to risk their own safety in order to capture images such as the ones you do
8003223 after watching your pics i m absolutely tired exhausted sooooo much information inside them one day i will make pictures like yours but it will take me three or four lives to learn to do it not great but incredible work thanks for showing us all the way master

8003235 your photographs are incredible powerful and touching i admire that you have a background in humanitarian aid
8003236 congratulations for your work your images give us a glampse about what war is about humiliation pain only for interests you make this horrible thing seem human thank you
8003237 i feel like ive been there on the front lines with you congratulations on the wonderful moving work youre producing and thank you for sharing your images with us my respect for what youre doing runs deeper than a simple appreciation of your images
8003238 i find these kinds of life photos as heartbreaking as those which vulgarly show death and destruction such good capture it tells a whole story
8003239 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo
8003240 superb photojournalistic images you have in your gallery compels me to comment on almost each one let them speak for themselves because they really dont need comments they yet deserve to be deeply appreciated for all their quality hope to see more of your fantastic work soon
8003241 ive often tried to express this practice but a photo is worth more than my words
8003242 ive always thought that photographs are a kind of self portrait of the photographer
8003243 your work is amazingly powerful some hard to look at but gripping nonetheless
8003244 ive seen many war photos and met a few war photographers but zoriahs work deeply touched me
8003245 simply excelent its a great reportage of a difficult situation
8003246 deserves to take a well earned place in history in the company of phillip jones griffith don mc cullen larry burrows and robert capa the minimal presentation of his work is perfect the viewer fills in the details and the images linger stubbornly in the memory to awake one from sleep in a cold sweat these images cannot be taken in in one viewing the viewer returns restlessly again and again attempting to process the information this is really happening iconic compelling images of war by a true professional i take my hat off to him
8003247 a chilling commentary on the madness of war all war
8003248 the worlds cruelty compressed into some thousand pixels its so impressive
8003249 right up there with robert capa wonderful work you should be with magnum you are showing all sides of the conflict
8003250 what you are doing is so so important i cannot even contemplate what horror and pain you have seen but see it we must true dedication and bravery is the only way to expose such inhumanity keep truth as your motto and maybe this silly world we live in will someday wake up and treat people as living souls not simply pieces of meat to be traded in worthless pointless conflicts i salute you sir
8003251 his commitment to photojournalism can not be denied i am certain he will secure a place amongst some of our best
8003252 i am awed by these images some rank among the best millitary images ive ever seen and ive collected all the greats
8003253 i am in awe i really dont know what to say i havent been this affected since i saw nachtweys work
8003254 it is a eye opener to view your work it brings strong emotions when doing so your work reflects another side of the world around us and beyond i will use it to find inspiration for myself thanks for sharing these pictures with us
8003255 amazing difficult to stomach i am very emotional but just brilliant and captivating thanks for sharing all your photos

8003263 this is like the night sky at a fourth of july celebration but were seeing it on a cosmic scale

8003266 a live forum where jan bender our host will interview the participants and lead a discussion that includes experts service providers and individual viewers in an interactive discussion of the issues raised
8003267 we better turn into a walking society like right now or were fucked
8003268 if we take a more free market approach i think
8003269 if we need energy we will find a way to get it
8003270 if you look at democratic sen barack obama and how he raises money for his campaign it was just so viral one person tells another using facebook
8003271 everyone has an answer about who theyre going to vote for
8003272 i think ultimately im just not sure how different either of them will be
8003273 theyre both reaching out toward the middle right now so whats the difference
8003274 what i mostly see is a lot of compromising on both sides and a lot of bringing people under the umbrella so theres no strong center
8003275 i just feel like everyone speaks in this lingo of either the other sides failure or our success and thats how political campaigns are won but its refreshing when you think that someones talking about an issue because they believe in it
8003276 theres a difference in experience theres a difference in the approach to decision making i think obama does seem more inspirational to me but mccain has a lot of experience in doing the kind of mind bending or boundary crossing things obama talks about
8003277 i wouldnt even call myself a democrat im definitely an independent or a moderate but ive seen a lot of people who arent interested in politics get very interested again in the political system and the democratic system here in the united states which i think is something very good for the country and good for the future
8003278 id really like to see obama and vice presidential candidate sen joseph biden be able to tie in whats going on now with what obamas message was in the past cause i think getting out of the primary season into the election season its getting dangerous now to fall into what obama would call the old style of politics and obamas definitely in danger of falling into that himself if hes not careful any politician would be
8003279 every step of the way since that clear day 19 months ago
8003280 i think she resonated with me and in that sense what she was saying was a broad vision of america and ive got to take it into consideration
8003281 they are incredible examples and inspirational whether they are in the white house or not i think this has been a really great thing for america to have them running
8003282 her emphasis on family values and the love of family and of america as a family and moving forward im no expert in politics but its not something thats traditionally associated with the democratic party
8003283 i find it especially interesting as a young evangelical christian how the democratic party is in ways saying a lot of the things that my generation of christians are saying about values and community and working together what michelle obama is saying is mirroring a lot of what i am hearing in other places its interesting a convergence of two different worlds
8003284 i am certainly proud of the improvement we have made as a program over the last three years and im grateful for the confidence and commitment that our administrative leadership continues to have in our progress
8003285 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8003286 we are deliberately obtaining the input and building the center that the people in this room want and that the constituents across the city want
8003287 you need to know that we like what we have going on right now
8003288 we have many healthy independent adults at whitaker mill we want to keep those programs and expand them
8003289 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8003290 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8003291 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech

8003364 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8003365 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8003366 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8003367 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8003368 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant

8003371 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8003372 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8003373 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8003374 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8003375 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8003416 i think hed be into game because he was a legendary hunter so it would be a fall dinner around game and truffles and rhone wines just earthy delicious foods
8003417 he was very francophile very knowledgable about food and wine
8003418 i would have gone to his garden and picked what he had he was an organic farmer and he was ahead of his time
8003419 i guess id like to ask him what he would have liked to accomplish if his time wasnt cut short
8003420 he was such a yankee with the boring yankee food id perk it up with a smorgasbord of tapas
8003421 because of his down home sports loving qualities some of my favorite things to cater are bachelor parties where guys get together and are just laid back he seems like a fun loving guy a good guy you could just hang out with
8003422 id make grilled polish sausage and id serve it with a baltic style porter hopefully i could win him over because hed probably want a coors light
8003423 i think he was sort of a plain man so id serve pot roast and vegetables
8003424 jefferson because i think he was famous for having loved red wine and good wine so that tells me in addition to being an incredibly brilliant person he was a hedonist i dont know if kennedy loved red wine but i bet he did id have the most to learn from them and id have the most fun with them
8003425 bordeaux each served at a time when bordeaux was the wine of kings and presidents id use the occasion if they were game to pull out one of my favorites from italy a barolo which is the king of all italian wines and easily as age worthy as bordeaux and which was far less appreciated in their day
8003426 he was the first president that i got to grow up with as an adult and when he got elected my business and the economy started to boom in america so i feel like i grew up in business with him also i feel like hed be fun at a party
8003427 the timing seemed right because were in these times where people dont necessarily know if their jobs going to be there tomorrow and when a lot of people dont necessarily like their jobs they have now
8003428 why dont you go out there and revisit those kinds of jobs that actually made america great those great working class blue collar jobs thats what these are it was great to get these contestants out of that cubicle that conceptual life were in and get out there and get some real raw experience in a place with high stakes and high rewards
8003429 in the old days it was the action heroes movie stars who were our heroes then for a really weird little while politicians and bankers and people that made a lot of money were our heroes
8003430 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
8003431 the ps3 is likely to gain significant market share until hardware prices reach mass market levels
8003432 and i like that every time youve thought about me for the last seven years it has made you hard
8003433 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8003434 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8003435 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8003436 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
8003437 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8003438 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsors of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear programme
8003439 im not aware of any degradation of our cooperation with respect to the six party talks
8003440 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border
8003441 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
8003442 first weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been under way in accordance with the 3 october agreement this measure already took effect on 14 august and relevant parties have already been informed
8003443 second we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies

8003445 i can confirm im joining spurs right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract
8003446 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8003447 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount
8003448 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let go him go if roman begins to play in england this will be good both for him and for the team
8003449 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8003450 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8003451 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other
8003452 when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
8003453 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that
8003454 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
8003455 there are now very few palaeoanthropologists who consider the neanderthals to have been stupid or who consider that they died out because they made flake rather than blade tools
8003456 we know that the neanderthals were very capable technicians and that their tools would have been excellent for activities such as butchery working skins or wood
8003457 however the blade tools manufactured by early modern humans in europe were often modified for specialisation as piercers chisels or engravers and as parts of composite tools such as harpoons
8003458 with modern humans we not only find a greater variety of tools but also much greater working of difficult materials like bone antler and ivory
8003459 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8003460 we continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses
8003461 the overwhelming majority of banks 98 of them continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards
8003462 we believe institutions can and will step up to the plate to provide whatever insurance funds are needed

8003484 i wanted to teach in an entertaining kind of way i have a wealth of knowledge about the modeling industry and how to create a career not just survive the season i wanted to be able to teach the girls coming in to the business what its all about and what to expect nobody tells them and theyre shocked
8003485 i had to make it relevant to today to write a memoir would have been boring a novel incorporating my experience and how i handled things and what girls should expect coming in to the business and what their parents should expect coming in to the business would be more relevant to todays girls
8003486 being famous wasnt a one hit job and all of a sudden youre famous being famous was about building a career it was one job and another job building blocks in a wall of bricks it wasnt just one giant rock that made a career so i wanted to teach women that its not easy or quick its about building a career
8003487 its not about failure its about trying something and risking something for attaining your goal so i never thought about if i didnt make it i would be a failure for a lot of girls today theyre like if i dont make it im this huge failure so theyll do anything and thats where the problems come in
8003488 i have found it suitable to play my role writing books or in newspapers to shed light on what i believe to be the threat by iranian influence to global security the middle east and persian gulf regions

8003490 the market just seems to be at a point where its stalled
8003491 any kind of movements are going to be exaggerated by whatever kind of news hits the markets
8003492 we have to remember that there is a substantial part of the population that has not enjoyed the boom
8003493 people frequently say a rising tide lifts all boats we see here with these numbers that a substantial part of the population has been left off the boat and left frankly floundering in the water
8003494 how do we generate more revenue that can be dedicated to expanding access for health insurance

8003500 is incorrect in insinuating that john mccain himself has brought up ayers
8003501 i t is in fact mccains campaign that has sought to use the ayers association against obama
8003502 the obama campaign is using a new television ad to take on the issue of obamas association with a 1970s radical who bombed the capitol and pentagon
8003503 accuse sen mccain of raising the ayers issue in the presidential campaign
8003504 the spot is incorrect in insinuating that john mccain himself has brought up ayers
8003505 im sure hes very patriotic but his relationship with mr ayers is open to question
8003506 i t is in fact mccains campaign that has sought to use the ayers association against obama and mccain spokesman brian rogers did so again upon learning about the ad
8003507 when barack obama was beginning his career in politics he was launching it at the home of william ayers an unrepentant domestic terrorist

8003513 now the white women generally are not as hard nosed about things as the white male and so many white women dont even understand that theyre being duped and they vote for a democrat not knowing that theyre digging their own grave
8003514 the democrat sic party is the minority party there is no question about it obama is a minority a half minority at least the membership is made up largely of minority blocs the hispanic caucus and the gay caucus caucuses that are all against the white person
8003515 trying to pose as a centrist party trying to win over the white male voter
8003516 now the white women generally are not as hard nosed about things as the white male and so many white women dont even understand that theyre being duped and they vote for a democrat not knowing that theyre digging their own grave
8003517 but now theyre going after the working class white male who is traditionally leery of the the gay lobby the caucuses and the other lobbies that are trying to take away his childs birthright
8003518 its a racket that is used to exploit primarily heterosexual christian white males birthright and steal from them what is their birthright and give it to people who didnt qualify for it
8003519 if you have a daughter who excels in school as a white man and your daughter even though youre a working class guy gets straight as in high school she will not get into the best colleges she will go to a second tier college and those positions will be reserved for minorities because of affirmative action

8003539 most developers struggle with the nuances of making a database dance well to their directions
8003540 indeed a sql maestro is required to perform interesting queries for data transformations during etl processing or extract load transform processing or data mining during analytics
8003541 trivially parallelizable framework so that even novice developers a k a interns could write programs in a variety of languages java c c perl python to analyze data independent of scale
8003542 on its own mapreduce can do a lot of important work in data manipulation and analysis integrating it with sql should just increase its applicability and power
8003543 mapreduce isnt needed for tabular data management thats been efficiently parallelized in other ways
8003544 but if you want to build non tabular structures such as text indexes or graphs mapreduce turns out to be a big help

8003549 these converter boxes are all capable of handling their basic function reasonably well and theyll enable you to use an analog tv after the switch to all digital broadcasts still if you want optimal picture quality from digital broadcasts youd be better off buying a decent digital tv
8003550 we obviously dont want to have fewer viewers weve been involved in educating the public about this for years it is what it is
8003551 i dont know if its an issue of converter box quality as much as its an issue of antennas
8003552 there are so many variables reception quality depends on where youre located whether youre in an apartment building or a single family home with an antenna on the roof when you hook up the converter box youve got to make sure youve got a proper antenna if you dont youll either see nothing or it will look pixelated
8003553 no there is no software update that is how the box is supposed to operate
8003554 why did they even put a guide on the box

8003557 the world of romeo and juliet deals with stark contrasts the complementary one between the lovers and the violent opposition between the montagues and the capulets
8003558 theres also a lot of light and shadow black and white imagery in the text we thought outfitting the characters in black and white would help illustrate the different factions and point out how deadly simplistic the world of the lovers is the only other color is red for blood of course
8003559 theyre going to take people out in a surprise eviction
8003560 thats why were not allowed to talk about who we voted for
8003561 the thing about doing it that way is youre never able to strategise
8003562 we all went in and did what we thought was the right thing to do rather than who are our friends
8003563 because they dont hold their friendship their loyalty so special
8003564 of course you are it wouldnt be the same without you my big brother buddy

8003566 basically we have set a standard in digital gaming consumers voted with their dollars they have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy the bar has been raised
8003567 i am pleased with the performance because we made 10 changes tonight and they could have turned up here thinking it was going to be a stroll in the park but they didnt
8003568 there are a lot of players in that 10 who played a lot of games in the championship last season so i dont think it was that much of a gamble but credit to cheltenham they made a fight of it i am just pleased they scored their second goal really late

8003576 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8003577 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8003578 at this stage he is refusing to cooperate with the israeli police and we cannot legally force him to do so
8003579 i have long dreamed that our party would produce another president matching john kennedys intellect and integrity his compassion and care for all his capacity to inspire just at home and peace around the world and this week my dream is coming true
8003580 kennedy at 43 proved that age makes a diffference in the white house
8003581 the whole world gave thanks that the more experienced richard nixon had lost that close election
8003582 in 1960 kennedy like obama today facing a republican tied to a failed past looked to a future of new ideas and opportunities
8003583 today we need new leadership we have lost our way wehave lost the respect of our allies we have lost the confidence of our investors and consumers

8003587 if john mccain has his way your bills will continue to grow and your paycheck will continue to shrink
8003588 john mccain offers us four more years of the broken politics broken policies and broken promises of the past
8003589 lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama for barack obama will restore prosperity and will make the changes we need to write a new chapter in the promise of america

8003592 college prepares you for the real world thats what my guidance counselors told me anyway
8003593 i thought a bachelor of arts degree was going to guarantee me a job with great benefits and a pension after i graduated from college in 1994 wrong
8003594 i decided to wrap every sandwich i prepared with my resume and include it with the order i sent out about 75 resumes that way over three days much to my surprise i got customer reactions some nice and some not so nice
8003595 i was aiming for any entry level job but all the calls i got were for sales and marketing positions the resume itself was pretty standard but i guess the delivery method was extraordinary and convinced employers that i knew something about marketing
8003596 a week before my start date a human resources manager called to say their company could not hire me because of budget cuts now i had to beg for my old job back again

8003607 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8003608 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8003609 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8003610 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8003611 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8003612 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood

8003620 candidates ask voters to stand up for them by donating money volunteering voting now its time for candidates to commit to standing for voters
8003621 signing the standing for voters pledge is a clear way to tell voters that care that all votes are counted and counted accurately and that candidates will do everything in their power to ensure that the elections are held to the highest standards
8003622 i am standing for voters i took the super pledge
8003623 is based on their word candidates and any candidate who puts the emblem on their website should expect the voters to hold them to their commitment
8003624 since they are often transported on an electronic memory card that fits easily into a pocket
8003625 you can count on me to speak about fair accurate and transparent elections in every breath i take
8003626 its important that this report is done well and that this is done in a way that brings value to a broad group of stakeholders public police and policy makers
8003627 its not risk free but you have to compare it to other types of force
8003628 the issue is not so much the tool as the rhetoric that revolves around it
8003629 in my experience that particular device has saved many lives
8003630 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8003631 they need food its not torture but they must come out
8003632 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8003633 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8003634 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8003635 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8003636 i wanted to make a blog on vocations one where everybody could bring their own experiences
8003637 i wanted to create a showcase for the pastoral experience of nuns
8003638 instead they made it look like it was a catwalk a la miss italy
8003639 when she became argumentative or she became forceful they said shes bitchy and there were comments about what she was wearing and how she looked sometimes from other women it was disgusting
8003640 women may look at what happened to hillary clinton and think absolutely not i am not going to put myself through that
8003641 but on the other hand i think back to how far women have come in terms of progress when my grandmother was born women couldnt vote and clinton had a very viable campaign and she almost won and by some accounts she actually did win there are now more women governors than ever before and those jobs can be springboards to making a run for the president
8003642 the next hillary clintons are out there strong progressive women who are working hard and looking to get elected
8003643 and for me being a young woman its incredibly inspirational for me to have someone like hillary clinton to look up to in the political process shes motivated so many of us and the sexist treatment of her by the media from where im coming from gave us all the more reason to fight
8003644 i think unfortunately for women that the presidency is viewed as a very masculine office because of its links to the military the fact that the president is the commander in chief its hard for some people to conceptualize a woman being in that position
8003645 there are still so many obstacles that have everything to do with gender there are those who still believe that they feel more comfortable with men in power even other women
8003646 after this it wont be so odd or weird for a woman to be such an exciting viable candidate for president
8003647 he tells her to get out of bed or im going to kill you and your kids
8003648 the intruder then tied her up and sexually assaulted her
8003649 she doesnt know if it the assault was the result of the eviction or not
8003650 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system

8003739 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8003740 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8003741 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8003742 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately

8003766 they are clothed theyre being fed and they may even have access to satellite tv
8003767 but obviously you know for reasons of security and whatever we cant tell you exactly where they might be
8003768 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
8003769 we shall do all that is possible to save them
8003770 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
8003771 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were injuries
8003772 nationally minded people in craigavon have shown that they are neither purchased nor intimidated

8003776 we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan

8003778 having these eyes in the sky to locate the taliban to see in some instances where theyre making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population having that type of technology in theatre we think is going to help us accomplish many of our goals
8003779 were very good at pulling the trigger when someone is shooting back at us were not very good at shooting back when theyre not
8003780 they were done in secret with no consultation with no public review
8003781 there is real concern the government is picking and choosing which artists it is supporting and which artists it is not supporting
8003782 i suggest in a democracy that is a dangerous thing
8003783 we live in a parliamentary democracy and this government seems to want to avoid parliament like the plague
8003784 is there an abuse here of executive authority if the government can cancel any program it chooses where does it stop
8003785 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
8003786 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
8003787 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8003788 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
8003789 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8003790 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
8003791 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
8003792 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
8003793 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware

8003810 you in this room are setting the tone for everything were doing this week
8003811 its been five years since lawrence v texas and 39 since stonewall and weve still got work to do before we achieve equality
8003812 we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and we have to close those gaps until the world as it is and the world as it should be are one and the same

8003814 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsors of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear programme
8003815 im not aware of any degradation of our cooperation with respect to the six party talks
8003816 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border
8003817 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
8003818 first weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been under way in accordance with the 3 october agreement this measure already took effect on 14 august and relevant parties have already been informed
8003819 second we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies

8003830 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8003831 bradman was distinct from anyone else his concentration was the great thing with him i suppose and hard work he had the will to do it and of course he was a fine player
8003832 he used his feet and despatched the bad ball for four usually on the ground not in the air he wouldnt have been caught out at deep square leg ill tell you that much
8003833 it was bloody hard work people dont realise the side that went to australia were all elderly because of the war there was nobody else myself godfrey evans and jack ikin were the only three under 30 so it was pretty hard work and i had to do all the bowling it was difficult to get bradman out alright he was a bloody fine player i mean and thats the end of it
8003834 i started to learn it then if you can pitch it on the leg stump and make it hit off its a good ball dont matter whos batting
8003835 when you try to swing it it doesnt always swing but it did when i got him out
8003836 they had to go late no good swinging it all the way otherwise any good player would see it naturally i made it go late
8003837 eric never did much in his life but he just went up and bowled him
8003838 bradman hadnt had time to adjust himself to the light or anything but thats what the games all about when a new batsman comes in bowl it straight but eric was no good in australia he was terrible
8003839 we had lost the series hopelessly already what did it matter it matters a lot now though no one else will do it finish with a 100 average
8003840 we were friends i dont see no reason not to be i found them all a good lot of blokes
8003841 but donnie didnt go into social circles he stayed away from that i was friendly with him more because i was involved in management and on the committees as he was so i got to know him better then
8003842 i suppose it did he was brought up in the country youve got to imagine someone who was brought up in the outback who had never been anywhere it took him a while to adjust but it didnt do too much for affect his batting
8003843 i could talk to him about anything i just never told anyone about anything he said never wrote a word about it
8003844 he used to write me letters some people would try to sell them but i never could betray a confidence and never told anyone what he said
8003845 ive got some letters he wrote to me about when jessie was dying i wouldnt tell people about them ive kept three or four she was a lovely person his wife charming she was brought up in the country not far from him
8003846 how do you judge a player by how many runs he gets thats what the games about you talk about stylish cricketers and he wasnt a stylish batsman but you look at tonnes of people who are stylish batsmen and they didnt get so many runs
8003847 he was very broad minded when limited overs matches came he didnt decry them not the 50 overs cricket he would have scored anywhere he averaged about 40 runs an hour in test cricket and thats bloody quick

8003853 whether or not people have any insurance coverage at all is just the tip of the iceberg
8003854 many people have health insurance that doesnt protect them from high bills or even assure them of care its a serious problem 25 million u s adults are underinsured up from 16 million two years ago
8003855 as that continues to erode one worries we are headed for even lower numbers
8003856 this means we need a comprehensive solution to deal with our fragmented health care delivery system and some guarantee that everyone can get coverage that is it supportable

8003863 its just so great with all the flags ive just been so up and down and im now ready for a break
8003864 i wasnt expecting this to come back with two gold medals is just amazing i think the races have sunk in but i dont think the world record will sink in for a long time its just been so overwhelming
8003865 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
8003866 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8003867 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8003868 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8003869 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8003870 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8003871 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open

8003876 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8003877 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8003878 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8003879 you come to these things just to be here to be part of the excitement
8003880 i probably would have been able to go but whether i wanted to spend 3 000 right now was a decision i really didnt want to make
8003881 its such a huge expense but even before he was elected there were people local democrats who said if you get this well support you wed love to have the voice of western north carolina there
8003882 once he got elected to be a delegate he got that support
8003883 representing you at the convention will be remembered as one of the greatest honors of my life
8003884 what i need from you now is your help and support

8003886 city officials have been directed by the mayor to refer all undocumented felons to immigration regardless of age
8003887 better himself and his situation through the foster care system
8003888 to circumvent the intentions of the mayor as it relates to undocumented minors involved in illegal drug sales
8003889 if this minor returns to the community i am very concerned that he will run from a nonsecure environment
8003890 further our office is not in a position to effectively provide supervision services to an undocumented person without the risk of violating federal law
8003891 remorseful for his actions and has a desire to better himself and his situation through the foster care system his ambitions are strong indications that the public will not suffer further transgressions of the law
8003892 like any child within our jurisdiction without a parent or guardian he deserves the opportunity to go into foster care

8003897 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8003898 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand

8003909 it seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically in the last few months
8003910 theres been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank driving slowly is one way to do that
8003911 the unfortunate thing is that the high price of fuel and the recession are accomplishing things that the traffic safety community couldnt accomplish
8003912 that is a silver lining to something thats very bad news to american families and to the economy
8003913 he is not a muslim and he says that but i am a muslim and if i was running for office would it be right to hold that against me
8003914 there is nothing un american about islam the best ideals of america are the best ideals of islam
8003915 keith took the heat and the shots before me he took the pain though they came gunning for me too
8003916 muslims needs to be engaged more actively in public life in our country where are our muslim councillors where are our muslim mayors
8003917 we have a message muslim americans are as american as apple pie
8003918 ignoring us is the politics of exclusion and exclusion i would suggest is un american
8003919 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself hes a perfectionist
8003920 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8003921 a tremendous athlete someone whos willing to learn hes humble now
8003922 we had to show him a little bit that this is a different level and everybody starts from the bottom
8003923 i usually challenged him and talked junk he got mad a few times
8003924 i wouldnt hit him the way to test somebodys humbleness or where they are mentally is to challenge them verbally to see how they can handle people coming at them and how they handle pressure in a game a lot of guys talk junk you have to be able to just take it in stride and keep your cool at first he had a little trouble with it but hes fine now
8003925 the seniors must get after him pretty good because every once in a while ill get a text from him saying are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me
8003926 i walked by the meeting room and terrelle was in there watching film this morning and i asked him if he was nervous
8003927 he just had that big smile and was trying to act like he wasnt going to be but hell be nervous
8003928 there is no editor avaialbe for c appcode filename xsd make sure the application for the file type xsd is installed
8003929 the government deemed it fit to review all mining arrangements with the aim of improving them so as to serve the best interests of the country and its people and also to avoid confrontations between corporate mining entities and local communities incidents which have resulted in unrest and loss of lives in the past
8003930 the government has as its primary interest the people especially the host mining communities
8003931 it is not just about setting up a selected task force that does not take into account the concerns of organisations monitoring the extractive industry as well as the views of the affected communities
8003932 a lot of factors touching on the interests of land owners the adequate payment of royalties lease agreements corporate social responsibility and a host of others have to be taken into consideration
8003933 the task force must review and make public all mining contracts ensure environmental protection is treated seriously and involve communities and civil society in all matters relating to mining
8003934 no political or other undue pressure or interference is exerted on members of the task force whether by government officials or mining companies
8003935 i hire a caterpillar machine for 1000 for eight hours to open up mining sites and have to care for dozens of my miners and their relatives so any adjustment in the laws that are unfavourable to us miners would simply discourage me it is not that one always finds diamonds sometimes i run at massive loss
8003936 before the 11 year long civil war fought between 1991 and 2002 we had more than 14 exporters now there are less than six so this tells you how the business is going any more taxes or conditionalities put on the way of exporters may well be too much and discouraging
8003937 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
8003938 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8003939 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalisation of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
8003940 many people blame the georgian president they are wrong in part but there is also an element of truth to it he cant be accused of having acted illegally it was legal to move our forces into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali but it would have been better not to
8003941 on one side you have a bear and on the other a little roquet
8003942 but when youre a chief of state you have to know about the reality of forces this was an incredible misjudgment by saakashvili
8003943 signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8003944 through our policy of neighbourliness the european union must do all we can to support georgia and ukraine
8003945 we find this unacceptable it only adds to the difficulty of solving the conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia
8003946 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
8003947 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8003948 has now chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
8003949 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8003950 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8003951 only yesterday i saw there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the u s navy passed through the bosphorus straits we have also learnt that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
8003952 s tu mismo la soluci n y el mundo que t quieres para los dem s
8003953 tutte le navi possono attraccare americani e altri che portano aiuti umanitari naturalmente ci che gli americani chiamano aiuti umanitari sono armi
8003954 posso assicurare che in georgia stanno arrivando aiuti umanitari e nientaltro
8003955 its hard not to suspect a degree of misogyny on the behalf of not only the abusing men but also the filmmakers theres no record of why the housewives should have been played by an amateur drag act but perhaps its nothing more than that noble british tradition of men slipping into frocks at the drop of a hat
8003956 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8003957 it seems to me that this administration has justified its crimes by not suspending the state of emergency that went up on september 11 2001 they are using emergency powers if you look at the whole of the spying military actions inside the us etc i would wager that if asked this administration will admit that we have been in a state of emergency for their tenure in office
8003958 what politician was rewarded by president bush with a 150 000 campaign fundraiser
8003959 darren white a thank you for whites loyalty to the bush campaign and his support for the failed bush economy and tax breaks for billionaires while middle class families struggle
8003960 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8003961 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8003962 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8003963 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8003964 you sleep when you can and hide for floodlights and switch trains at dawn
8003965 its wild im with my brother and two friends who are going to california but were all going to stop off for the show at the dnc
8003966 you have a huge amount of people that are interested in peaceful protest and you have a small percentage of people who want to shake things up a little more
8003967 ive been part of those things and they can get scary but i think this event will stay peaceful maybe a little bit of scuffling will go on here or there but i dont anticipate much
8003968 we hope that barack obama can change things the way he says he can and not be part of washingtons politics as usual we are there to support him but were also there hold him to that progressive agenda the u s is just falling apart and taking the world with it and we have a chance to try and turn things around
8003969 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8003970 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
8003971 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8003972 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8003973 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
8003974 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8003975 we have major concerns about the mayors right to due process
8003976 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8003977 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8003978 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8003979 i still cannot see an easy end to the turbulence
8003980 it might take days or months until everything reaches the point where violence erupts
8003981 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
8003982 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8003983 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
8003984 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
8003985 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other
8003986 when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
8003987 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that
8003988 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
8003989 there are now very few palaeoanthropologists who consider the neanderthals to have been stupid or who consider that they died out because they made flake rather than blade tools
8003990 we know that the neanderthals were very capable technicians and that their tools would have been excellent for activities such as butchery working skins or wood
8003991 however the blade tools manufactured by early modern humans in europe were often modified for specialisation as piercers chisels or engravers and as parts of composite tools such as harpoons
8003992 with modern humans we not only find a greater variety of tools but also much greater working of difficult materials like bone antler and ivory
8003993 if it wasnt for them i would be out on the streets or in jail somewhere
8003994 we will have a lower level of service for our customers but southwest is only responding to customer demand
8003995 he was one very special young man known for being christ honoring polite fun loving friendly hard working respectful dedicated and handsome
8003996 i just want to honor my parents they have done so much for me i never want to break their hearts by something i may do
8003997 det er nemmere at skyde skylden p andre end at p tage sig ansvaret
8003998 vi ved at folk har brug for en grund f r de ndrer sig de skal have at vide hvordan de skal ndre sig de skal have st tte og mindes om det og de har brug for opbakning mange af disse principper kan benyttes i udarbejdelsen af materiale der skal st tte og opmuntre til forandring
8003999 developing rsm pedals has been a multi year program for us that has resulted in a platform on which we can develop in many directions
8004000 our 24 bit hardware firmware and software system will allow us to model many acoustic spaces instruments and electronic modifications at very little cost to the customer one could easily be misled by the compact pedal form factor but under the hood of our rsm processors you will find a lot of substantial fx for djs keyboardists and guitar amp effects loops alike
8004001 the same weather patterns that bring the fog in from the bay also serve to clear the air of smoke thus there was imperceptible impact from the smoke
8004002 all of us are driven by the simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8004003 and that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope and you see that is why i love this country
8004004 oh my god i have no idea how you did that thats amazing to me
8004005 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
8004006 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
8004007 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
8004008 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
8004009 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
8004010 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8004011 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8004012 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8004013 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8004014 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8004015 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8004016 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8004017 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8004018 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8004019 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8004020 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8004021 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8004022 it shall be an offence to deliberately mislead through advertising in relation to the termination of pregnancy and alternatives thereto
8004023 any person association or body corporate shall be guilty of an offence
8004024 material which contains false information and is untruthful or in its overall presentation deceives or is in any way likely to deceive the average person even if the information is factually correct
8004025 causes or is likely to cause the average pregnant woman to take a decision in relation to the termination of her pregnancy she would not have taken otherwise
8004026 its common for cpcs to use misleading films ultrasound pictures and written materials to scare and emotionally manipulate women into continuing their pregnancies
8004027 by presenting women with false information about abortion and the development of the fetus cpcs threaten womens abilities to make informed choices
8004028 it is ironic to see pro life organisations being accused of inaccuracy by an organisation which claims on its website that the unborn child does not become a baby until birth
8004029 most insidious implying criminal activity manipulation and entirely sinister motives
8004030 governments have failed to enact any legislation as requested by the supreme court in the 1988 morgentaler decision and that is why today we have no protection for the unborn in canada abortions are totally unrestricted by any laws but apparently educating through advertising about this truth is not allowed
8004031 9 months that is the amount of time the government say it is legal to have an abortion
8004032 has been running for two years and one complaint has been received
8004033 council did not do its due diligence in looking for
8004034 asc is the industry body committed to creating and maintaining community confidence in advertising
8004035 acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is
8004036 it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that binds us all into one human family
8004037 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community
8004038 the connection between abortion and racism is that certain people are somehow not fully human
8004039 like racism abortion allows us to treat people inhumanely if it makes our lives easier and like racism abortion provides a sense of justification for actions we know in our hearts are wrong
8004040 the unborn are obviously easier to discriminate against than any group of born humans they cannot march they cannot protest they are invisible
8004041 we want to commend those men and women and say that life is a civil right life is precious and that it transcends politics
8004042 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8004043 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons
8004044 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8004045 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8004046 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8004047 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004048 ya know i really thought i had hit rock bottom but today its like theres rock bottom then 50 feet of crap then me
8004049 this is a statewide problem its not a northern or southern problem its not rural or urban its not partisan
8004050 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004051 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004052 the epas refusal to control pollution from oil refineries is the latest example of the bush administrations do nothing policy on global warming
8004053 oil refineries contribute substantially to global warming posing grave threats to new yorks environment health and economy
8004054 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8004055 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8004056 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
8004057 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8004058 he is being questioned at the police station in sderot for entering the gaza strip in defiance of a military decree banning israeli citizens from doing so
8004059 the nokia n85 was created to be more than the sum of its parts offering a complete mobile entertainment package designed for connecting sharing and discovering
8004060 the iconic nokia nseries dual slider design has evolved to become smaller and sleeker while integrating the newest features and services to deliver the best mobile experience to date
8004061 scott already knows all the key players in our industry and how newspapers work
8004062 it appears to be an internal software processing error but were going to have to do some forensics on it
8004063 were already getting calls from people who arent making it to the convention
8004064 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8004065 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8004066 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8004067 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8004068 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004069 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
8004070 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
8004071 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
8004072 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
8004073 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
8004074 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
8004075 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
8004076 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
8004077 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
8004078 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004079 because what if the kids had of been outside or what if they would have went in the school you know
8004080 we did receive a call saying that an individual had been shot in the stomach
8004081 she was scared she said they had to hide under the desk
8004082 the school was lockdown just to ensure the safety of the children in case there was some substance to the call
8004083 and theyre really hoping and asking that residents in the area will let us know if they know of any criminal activity so that we can make a movement to try to stamp out some of this violence
8004084 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004085 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8004086 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8004087 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8004088 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004089 the people of santa cruz should rest assured that we will stop any minister arriving in santa cruz because they are not welcome
8004090 the political effects of a radicalised position are not yet visible but they could be tremendously adverse for santa cruz
8004091 we are no longer just a simple government but rather the power of the people
8004092 the debate on the referendum must not last beyond next week
8004093 if its through a law its a law if its by decree its a decree the new constitution has to be approved and we will ensure it is approved
8004094 if some groups do not want to understand the overwhelming sentiment of bolivian people the thoughts and suffering of the majorities then surely they will continue to reduce more and more in numbers and become more violent we have an obligation to ensure order so that there is respect between bolivians
8004095 we will not allow more outrages upon our institution and much less attacks on police officers
8004096 the very very few of our colleagues who took the wrong path and did things they shouldnt and were aggressively prosecuted we all know that gets a lot of publicity
8004097 but i knew since i came from the ranks that for every rare bad apple like that there are thousands and thousands who are just doing some wonderful things we needed to do more to bring attention to that and recognition for those people so they could have a moment to shine for their good work
8004098 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8004099 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8004100 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8004101 we are able to work with local faa officials to manually process flight plans
8004102 still no impact to operations at dia if the computer issues persist we may begin to see an impact
8004103 we wouldnt let him throw a side until he was symptom free
8004104 hes pretty confident that hes ready to go he probably could have pitched the other day in toronto
8004105 colorado is blessed with being near the major wind projects in the nation near rail and highway infrastructure and has a good tax and business climate
8004106 colorado should be a model for the u s and the world in what can be done in the state when the governor and the congressional delegation team up
8004107 we havent gotten close to reaching the envelope of what renewable energy can do
8004108 the new energy economy is about energy security environmental security and its about jobs
8004109 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004110 efforts to get your kids on the same soccer teams dont really count as enduring friendship
8004111 seeing tibetans secretly pass banned images of the dalai lama reminds me of my grandfather leonid who hid his yarmulke
8004112 greenplum has seamlessly integrated mapreduce into its database making it possible for us to access our massive dataset with standard sql queries in combination with mapreduce programs
8004113 we are finding this to be incredibly efficient because complex sql queries can be expressed in a few lines of perl or python code
8004114 there is no way that a country of 63 million like thailand will let a group of five people form a street gang to seize control
8004115 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8004116 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8004117 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe you need flash player 8 or higher and javascript enabled to view this content biden
8004118 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8004119 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8004120 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8004121 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8004122 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8004123 the incident has claimed the lives of hundreds of fish mostly stone loach but also roach and pike
8004124 we are anxious to find out the cause of the pollution but our officers are also engaged in an operation to pump oxygen into the canal to protect stock
8004125 the agency would urge anyone who knows anything about this to help our investigation identify those responsible
8004126 used every piece of dirty equipment they could get their hands on
8004127 in every way invol2ver is closer to a production album than anything else we were like kids in a toy shop basically hunting out as many old mixing desks drum machines and guitar pedals that we could find on ebay
8004128 its like a collage of new york sounds old gear is so unpredictable and it had a mind of its own this album was very spontaneous in that way
8004129 ours is not the first generation to be morally blinded by building a lifestyle based on energy from foreign shores
8004130 slavery was the importation of cheap energy without regard to its moral cost
8004131 over the past few days we have received reports from users of spam and phishing attacks
8004132 we have also detected and contained a worm we are investigating every report removing false content blocking bogus links and addressing the concerns of our users these efforts have limited the affected users to a small percentage of those on facebook
8004133 it is very similar to a lot of the old worms
8004134 if you receive messages from a friend on a social network you are not expecting them to be a vehicle to carry a worm or trojan horse
8004135 our insider reports that the prez gave a breezy 40 minute tour of his time in office calling it a cool experience for laura and i
8004136 these were the more noble than thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so
8004137 all scriptures is given be inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness

8004147 the images of paris and britney came up too quickly for people to really respond on their dials but the rally in berlin set them rolling and it prepped them for the negative message in the last 10 seconds of the ad i think it was about drilling
8004148 so the celebrity ad wasnt about the celebrities it was about the berlin rally and gas prices
8004149 since the focus groupers hadnt really picked up on paris britney they had no idea what obama was actually responding to
8004150 it is simply wanting to know how many people did you question what were the questions we understand the need for confidentiality but once a pollster makes results public the information needs to be public people need to be able to evaluate whether it was sound research
8004151 for allegedly mischaracterizing on msnbc the results of focus groups he conducted during the 2000 republican convention
8004152 to ask a question in the way that you get the right answer
8004153 the images of paris and britney came up too quickly for people to really respond on their dials but the rally in berlin set them rolling and it prepped them for the negative message in the last 10 seconds of the ad i think it was about drilling
8004154 so the celebrity ad wasnt about the celebrities it was about the berlin rally and gas prices
8004155 since the focus groupers hadnt really picked up on paris britney they had no idea what obama was actually responding to
8004156 all along again maybe its just hoping i thought wed have him
8004157 thats the way weve been approaching it if the commissioner changes i mean if it doesnt go through then well have to make adjustments
8004158 i respect the opinion of the public but from now on i dont talk about players who were not called
8004159 lets forget this issue the coach makes his choices i wish luck to the national team even without me they can do great in the world cup
8004160 it would be an individual performance game where rookies would be given the opportunity to play
8004161 well we have not come to a consensus on that yet but since our starters are focusing on the browns we have seen them and know what they can do i would say we would focus more on the rookies getting playing time so we can finalize who else we want on our roster
8004162 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8004163 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8004164 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8004165 what about the vast majority of women who are the lifeblood of our society nurses schoolteachers bus drivers single parent mothers who dont have that structure
8004166 is there a way that we can invest differently in this country to bring more support and attention to the issues that are basically strangling the family unit
8004167 shes going to be a little more different and more from the industry standpoint
8004168 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
8004169 easy to learn easy to work ed easy to play
8004170 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004171 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004172 barack obama promises four more years of destruction while john mccain promises four more years of promises four more promises
8004173 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8004174 i think he could have sent a signal to say i want this tamped down
8004175 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
8004176 teach the children right from wrong and when they are older they will not stray from that path
8004177 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
8004178 since the first nokia nseries device came to market in 2005 this range of devices has consistently represented cutting edge technology combined with an unparalleled user experience the nokia n96 builds upon this tradition to bring mobility to todays most valuable internet services
8004179 with support for movies music games navigation and more right out of the box the real power of the nokia n96 is that it provides an open application environment for users to define their own mobile lifestyle
8004180 this beats that collected dust series consist of beats that were either for artists and were never used or were just not complete enough for me to ever release them with mcs spittin over them
8004181 the guys running orchard brands are very smart and capable disciplined investors and operators
8004182 they are among the leaders of the industry and now have a whole lot more arrows in their quiver
8004183 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8004184 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8004185 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8004186 connect the web with language to find new user interfaces that could make it possible for everyone to do common web tasks more quickly and easily
8004187 explore interfaces that are closer to features that might make it into firefox
8004188 users to map and insert maps anywhere translate on page search amazon google wikipedia yahoo youtube etc digg and twitter look up and insert yelp review get the weather syntax highlight any code you find and a lot more
8004189 presumably the experiment didnt also lead to a rash of criminal activity among those who read the anti free will passage
8004190 w hat would happen if those people were brought back to the lab two weeks later
8004191 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8004192 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8004193 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8004194 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8004195 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8004196 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8004197 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8004198 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8004199 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8004200 next stop new york city for his performance at fashion rocks and the nfls kickoff show to take place in columbus circle in front of an estimated 70 000
8004201 i think that his position in dealing with the issues that are important to israel like they are important to me in america is the best and kindest thing you can say is ambiguity
8004202 of grave concern it either comes from deeply held views that he has or lack of experience one or the other but in either case hes too close to the presidency not to have formed views about this that dont require having to explain it two or three different times
8004203 the controversial figure at the center of a number of criminal investigations including most recently the alleged abduction of his own 7 year old daughter
8004204 those companies become victims of the breach as much as the individuals whose information has been affected
8004205 in many cases they entrusted a vendor to provide a service to safeguard information at the highest level and when they transport it from one place to another unencrypted theyre not taking it to the highest level
8004206 those companies become victims of the breach as much as the individuals whose information has been affected
8004207 in many cases they entrusted a vendor to provide a service to safeguard information at the highest level and when they transport it from one place to another unencrypted theyre not taking it to the highest level
8004208 shia just got back to the set last week we incorporated his injury into it not because it was absolutely necessary but director michael bay in particular wanted to be able to protect him on the set hes still going to be running around in this movie bay literally just wanted for labeoufs safety to make sure that we werent playing around with his injury thats why we put it in
8004209 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8004210 the church teaches that from the time of conception each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8004211 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any state of development
8004212 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to catholic bishops
8004213 many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8004214 the browser based game is something thats really attractive because of the accessibility
8004215 it has this promise of everybody has this and its one of the biggest platforms on the planet and its now to the point where you can do some very slick polished nice things within browser technology
8004216 we started looking at being browser based on day one but the technology for what we wanted to do wasnt there
8004217 friends and family of the deceased should not be expected to opt out from attending their loved ones funeral or burial service
8004218 nor can funeral attendees simply avert their eyes to avoid exposure to disruptive speech at a funeral or burial service the mere presence of a protestor is sufficient to inflict the harm
8004219 were going to have to do some forensics on it
8004220 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
8004221 allah memberikan kita kejayaan kemenangan ini merupakan saat penentu dan bakal menentukan tujuan negara ini saya turut dalam kegembiraan yang dirasakan semua rakyat malaysia pada hari bersejarah ini ini merupakan kemenangan buat rakyat

8004224 fewer americans went without health insurance last year for the first time since president george w bush took office as more people received government coverage u s officials said on tuesday the official u s poverty rate remained stable even as a higher percentage of children were classified as impoverished while u s median household income rose a bit in 2007 the u s census bureau also reported it said 15 3 percent of americans had no public or private health insurance in 2007 down from 15 8 percent in 2006 a total of 45 7 million were uninsured reduced from 47 million
8004225 in the united states 63 participants reported 0 altogether globally there were 80 0 figures reported
8004226 wired coms survey of iphone 3g users suggests that widespread data speed problems have more to do with carriers networks than with apples handsets
8004227 it apple needs to wait for all of its carriers to optimize 3g network behavior in terms of number of towers how theyre positioned and how much
8004228 tak ada manipulasi dari segi amalan demokrasi di negara ini
8004229 seperti yang kita telah nyatakan dari awal bahwa kita akan hadapi tantangan sulit dalam pertandingan ini
8004230 kita bersedia membuat perubahan yang perlu supaya dapat mengembalikan keyakinan rakyat terhadap bn
8004231 walaupun kita kalah bn akan menunaikan janji terhadap penduduk permatang pauh
8004232 how would you feel about your personal health information flowing freely over the internet between public health officials healthcare providers insurance and data clearinghouse companies and others without your permission if this doesnt sound like a good idea its time to become informed about federal health privacy law today when americans visit a healthcare provider for services including dental and eye exams they receive a form with a title such as notification of privacy rights many assume that signing the form guarantees that personal information wont be shared with third parties but the form offers no such guarantees and neither does federal law
8004233 you still have good earnings power in energy and materials
8004234 theyre selling at good valuations i still have a lot of concern about financials particularly in small caps
8004235 management in small caps can make you or break you
8004236 its very important to have management that can not only talk a good game but execute
8004237 lotteries are good places to invest when the economy is slow
8004238 state governments need revenue they like to have new games and people want to play the lottery
8004239 titan is the only company that has spare capacity to increase the supply
8004240 when it comes to healthcare two questions dominate first how do you improve access to care in this country where the number of uninsured distorted number here continues to rise and second how do you stem the rising cost of care which presents a crushing burden on government business and individuals alike barack obama would have the government organize a healthcare marketplace where private plans and one new government run plan would compete to sell insurance with government subsidies for low income customers the likely result more americans buying insurance with the help of government with more people insured but government spending a lot for subsidies john mccain would change the tax treatment of health insurance in a way that would encourage americans to buy insurance on the open market eliminating the current bias toward employer sponsored care the likely result more people shopping for insurance on their own with more choices but perhaps more risks
8004241 when teenagers say that drugs are the biggest problem they face we adults probably should listen but it is the bad behavior of adults that is perpetuating an illicit drug problem for american teens a study by the national center on addiction and substance abuse casa concludes the columbia university based center conducted its annual survey of teens and parents and found that for the first time more teenagers said prescription drugs were easier to buy than beer the drugs of choice are typically addictive painkillers as to how they were obtained teens who admitted knowing prescription drug abusers said 31 percent got them from friends or classmates 34 percent got them from their parents or by raiding the parents medicine cabinet and only 9 percent said they got them from drug dealers the rest did not specify
8004242 i am pleased with the performance because we made 10 changes tonight and they could have turned up here thinking it was going to be a stroll in the park but they didnt
8004243 there are a lot of players in that 10 who played a lot of games in the championship last season so i dont think it was that much of a gamble but credit to cheltenham they made a fight of it i am just pleased they scored their second goal really late
8004244 as the district viewed it they were going to have to pay that whether they won lost or whatever
8004245 i think it is important to note that mr oonk has denied the charges in full
8004246 its going to allow mr oonk to focus on whats important to him including his family and other opportunities
8004247 who would support a self serving political agenda at the expense of your health wealth and job mobility afl cio president john sweeney and colorado executive director mike cerbo in a recent denver post commentary they perpetuate the big lie behind politician controlled medicine that the free market is not working and that consequently costs have been spiraling out of control but costs have been increasing largely because of what unions defend a tax code that favors employer sponsored insurance
8004248 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas vp text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
8004249 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients
8004250 here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his vp pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers
8004251 adults who struggle with a sweet tooth or battle a lifelong craving for bacon may have something more than weak willpower to blame at least those with a history of chronic childhood ear infections
8004252 i was very moved by sen kennedy and his effort to come here it was a powerful thing to do
8004253 mitt romney lands in denver no news on vp pick
8004254 it was great spectrum that had been set aside only for aviation use
8004255 please not yet more bad news how bad can it get
8004256 there surely is money to be made in some of the financial stocks particularly if you are patient many financial companies still have good franchises and good balance sheets
8004257 they have managed to avoid most of the mortgage problems that have brought down some of their competitors as a result they should pick up business and perhaps acquire weaker players
8004258 we are concerned that there is more bad news ahead for a number of financial institutions
8004259 in baseball terminology we may be in the middle or late innings of the subprime mortgage mess but were probably in the early innings for problems with other real estate loans and different types of business loans
8004260 that will compensate you if you have to wait a while for the stocks to rebound
8004261 any democrat or republican who said they were going to support us on health care or free choice and turns against us is going to paint a target
8004262 were not going to just win this election and hope barack obama does well people want something to happen
8004263 our members are sick and tired of politicians who are after their votes the day before the election and after their throats
8004264 for our members politics is not about democrats or republicans or left or right its about right and wrong
8004265 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8004266 this court finds that defendants discharge was reasonably related to the governments interest in ensuring that its soldiers are fit to serve
8004267 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 that he stiffed the city
8004268 i put like all the change i had in the meter
8004269 sils veulent la d gradation de ces relations ils lobtiendront bien entendu mais sils veulent sauvegarder les relations strat giques ce qui est totalement dans lint r t la fois de la russie et de leurope tout ira bien

8004276 you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet renos her father
8004277 god willing and with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance to succeed
8004278 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
8004279 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8004280 this is the first award in the caribbean that utilizes the complete in house turn key marine construction and dredging services of both our east coast subsidiaries
8004281 with the addition of subaqueous services earlier this year we now have better ability to take advantage of opportunities like this which require a hydraulic dredge component while better controlling the projects critical path
8004282 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer like air pollution than things that are within their own control such as overweight which is a well established
8004283 there is no question that a funeral home would be liable for negligence if it took photographs of the deceased and then disseminated those photos without authorization from the surviving family members
8004284 family members have a personal stake in honoring and mourning their dead and we object to unwarranted public exploitation
8004285 this intrusion upon our grief has disgraced the rites and respect we sought and continue to seek on behalf of our beloved daughter nikki
8004286 all we ever wanted from day one was to have the chp help us in getting these pictures removed from web sites
8004287 but that didnt happen it was only when someone recommended that we hire a lawyer that we eventually filed the lawsuit
8004288 the chp needs to be held accountable for this case law needs to be established to insure that this doesnt happen to another family
8004289 and what would you expect to be done if this happened to one of your children
8004290 its as if they took one of nikkis body parts and put it on display at the mall for anyone to walk by and gawk at
8004291 i dont know how to put in words how i feel
8004292 its not even grief anymore i just cant describe it
8004293 not only will they have to sharpen their driving skills but theyll have to master using the multiple weapons and explosives at their disposal if they want to survive the race
8004294 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8004295 we are particularly pleased to bring mindhabits to the pc and mac platforms
8004296 if you have a computer youre ready to launch your new outlook on life
8004297 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8004298 this is an important announcement this is flight 121 to los angeles if your travel plans today do not include los angeles now would be a perfect time to disembark

8004300 enhance culture as part of the soft power of our country to better guarantee the peoples basic cultural rights and interests
8004301 culture has become a more and more important source of national cohesion and creativity and a factor of growing significance in the competition in overall national strength
8004302 this volume makes an unparalleled contribution to the growing and vital field of measurement and human rights the book offers a useful categorization and assessment of repressive and rogue states allowing us to measure the extenet of repressive state behavior more accurately his rotberg work should embolden external critiques and facilitate more transparent and accountable foreign policy
8004303 a monumental contribution and captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8004304 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8004305 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8004306 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8004307 we can track a given food source a given food supply and if theres a problem find out quickly deal with the problem and make sure canadians are protected
8004308 its part of the stephen harper plan to protect food safety and consumer safety generally
8004309 i want to make sure that we have the highest public safeguards and safety nets in place thats where my focus has been
8004310 i would be concerned about any proposal which might weaken ontario and or canadian safety guidelines
8004311 i think all members of the government has been on top of this
8004312 i think we all feel tremendously for those who have been affected by this terrible development and i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected
8004313 failed to maintain a level of sanitariness suitable to prevent the contamination of food products
8004314 if the maple leaf foods defendant has exercised reasonable care in maintaining sanitary conditions that were suitable and had diligently been testing its products the food products in question would not have been recalled
8004315 the plaintiff became incredibly ill and was resultantly bed ridden for a period of three or four consecutive days after eating a recalled product
8004316 i thought i wouldnt buy any sort of sliced cold meats for a bit
8004317 its listeriosis with maple leaf today but i mean there might be another problem tomorrow
8004318 im just going to stop for a while until everythings cool again
8004319 i just dont want to get sick and miss school and not get my credit
8004320 we believe when we talk about the transport of our children we should stick to vehicles where there is no disagreement that we are using the safest possible vehicle
8004321 a coach out on the road is he going to decide to pull off in the miramichi or in sussex with a load of kids not on your life without some direction from higher ups and so on there should be a clear directive given and it should be provincewide not district by district
8004322 we want the children to be safe when they are travelling
8004323 all parents want to know that their children will be safe when they travel to events particularly in light of the bathurst tragedy
8004324 all supporting that goal and taking active steps to attain it
8004325 he cant be considered a combatant whether lawful or unlawful without being in afghanistan hes not there hes a canadian citizen who was working in canada
8004326 he clearly had no concern at all whether it was going to be used for an attack on civilians or an attack on military targets or on soldiers of his own country as long as it made a big bang
8004327 all the opposition parties are clear they will not support this government going to october 2009
8004328 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls to the government to create that certainty
8004329 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8004330 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful
8004331 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
8004332 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks
8004333 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word

8004368 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there you can go under the radar a little bit
8004369 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8004370 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flame history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance
8004371 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear but at the same time i played enough games here to know what kind of fan base and what kind of team they are
8004372 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8004373 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8004374 i said to todd does this remind you of vancouver a little bit he said yeah here we go again
8004375 i havent played a home game on canadian soil since i was 16 years old so i think the whole idea of canadians knowledge of the game their love their passion for the sport is how i grew up
8004376 im just gonna come in and put myself in a good position to be successful with my conditioning this team has been there right from the past five six seven years
8004377 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8004378 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8004379 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8004380 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8004381 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8004382 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8004383 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8004384 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8004385 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of

8004400 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8004401 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8004410 i think we all know about csi and weve all seen these cop procedurals before
8004411 this show is the beginnings of where forensics started things that we take for granted like lie detectors or infrared i think the audience is interested in where all of that comes from
8004412 i think with the mystery genre violence becomes this prism through which we can explore our emotions and what it is that makes us human

8004459 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
8004460 this study by dr mondal and colleagues has crucial implications in the persistence of sub endothelial hiv reservoirs and will be important to the development of future therapies

8004480 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels

8004490 there has been no windfall many of the retail arms of power companies have struggled to make money and have held down their prices to customers while wholesale prices have soared
8004491 i have no problem with companies making profits these are excessive profits immoral profits it isnt good enough and weve got to take action
8004492 last year we made just a whisker under 500 million in the uk that doesnt buy even one new power station it is our plan to spend more money than we earn in the uk for the next ten years that is a big commitment and if there was a windfall tax that is the sort of commitment that would have to be re evaluated
8004493 putting a tax on the electricity companies means they would lose money at a time when we need to spend 100billion on replacing old power stations over the next 11 years every pound taken from the companies would have to be raised by them elsewhere in the credit crisis that is difficult enough but a raid on electricity companies bank accounts would send out a very unfortunate signal to the world of investment
8004494 we are currently working with government on solutions to help them reach their 2010 targets on fuel poverty
8004495 the signal we are getting from government is that they are not minded to impose a windfall tax per se of the sort that was brought in after the 1997 election
8004496 however they could yet impose a mini windfall tax for example by making a retrospective charge on carbon emission permits that were given free to energy companies or by choosing to auction the remaining 3 per cent of carbon permits that they are allowed to release under european commission rules
8004497 gas and electricity was eating up more than 10 per cent of our income and weve got no choice other than to be a lot more careful than we have been in the past
8004498 i have to say i do get a bit frustrated when i see the big profits announcements made by the energy companies
8004499 they seem to be making more and more money yet they dont seem to be doing that much at all to help consumers get the best deal scottish power didnt tell me about how i could save money by going on a capped product or by going online

8004552 the era of cheap energy is well and truly dead and therefore britain would do well to get its energy from sensible places and think imaginatively about where those places might be
8004553 there is a huge global grab for energy going on weve got to make sure that britain is protected that we have the energy we need
8004554 its very quiet full of wildlife when you walk along the footpaths youll often come a across a deer
8004555 drilling for oil isnt compatible with a place that should be for quiet contemplation and getting away from urban life
8004556 it is our opinion that 100 million barrels of oil or even more is recoverable from the uk south of england alone possibly more
8004557 this would be advantageous to the country not just for the creation of jobs in the haulage and service maintenance sector for example but also in adding a large amount to the chancellors purse and reducing the uks energy deficit

8004570 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms

8004607 there are provinces with populations larger than most european countries that are only now beginning to see rapid development
8004608 the main driver for rio in our opinion is from bulk commodities which are largely tied to chinas economic growth and according to rio it expects chinese demand to recover after the olympics
8004609 we are of the opinion that this is a good price given consideration for the current softening in oil prices the turbulence on global stock markets and the geopolitical stage
8004610 they estimated the wind at 80 to 90 mph after it broke the instrument

8004676 russia today took a significant and negative step in recognizing the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia two separatist georgian provinces
8004677 i also remain deeply concerned about russias continued refusal to comply with the terms of the ceasefire ending hostilities with georgia
8004678 at a time of high energy prices and instability in global markets it is important to understand that events in georgia part of a strategic energy corridor affect individual lives far beyond the caucasus
8004679 there are some encouraging signs that our allies are responding to these events
8004680 in addition i am proud that cindy is currently visiting georgia on a humanitarian mission she has carried out this kind of important work all over the world and it is clear that the georgian people are suffering in the aftermath of russias invasion given the level of need there i am proud that she has traveled to that war torn country at this time

8004710 i think forever im going to be his little sister
8004711 i think if she will do everything opposite of what ive been doing throughout the years she will be number one in the world for a long time thats as simple as it is
8004712 its like talking to the wall the same thing doesnt make any difference so what i can do they want me to be happy and they want me to be great in the press room like be nice speak nice and all these things why should i
8004713 its stupid rules that somebody made it in i dont know 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way

8004716 the spadea line has kind of like been downgraded to like hats and t shirts on my website
8004717 the other thing i thought was weird too is the gymnasts are so much smaller than you actually think on tv theyre small but when they walk in packs looks like a group of second graders they look about 14 and theyre about 48

8004729 there will be flight delays it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8004730 we said from the beginning we didnt think there would be a lot of protesters this isnt 1968 its 2008
8004731 government is very different today a lot of that training with our police officers was how to respond appropriately to any event not overact dont allow an incident to escalate into a larger scale issue
8004732 the bottom line is i would argue that we have the finest secret service in the world and these guys are pros and they have spent thousands of hours working to make sure things like some plot if it was indeed a plot to go after barack obama that the people cant succeed
8004733 the level of preparedness every one of our police officers have had at least 30 hours most of them had 40 hours of additional training the idea is that you do all this preparation planning and then you train like crazy and when you implement youre goal is to make sure that whatever protests there are that theyre not the news the news has got to be the convention and our city
8004734 they worked in collaboration with us as well as you could ever hope
8004735 i would appreciate it if you did not do that
8004736 bradman was distinct from anyone else his concentration was the great thing with him i suppose and hard work he had the will to do it and of course he was a fine player
8004737 he used his feet and despatched the bad ball for four usually on the ground not in the air he wouldnt have been caught out at deep square leg ill tell you that much
8004738 it was bloody hard work people dont realise the side that went to australia were all elderly because of the war there was nobody else myself godfrey evans and jack ikin were the only three under 30 so it was pretty hard work and i had to do all the bowling it was difficult to get bradman out alright he was a bloody fine player i mean and thats the end of it
8004739 i started to learn it then if you can pitch it on the leg stump and make it hit off its a good ball dont matter whos batting
8004740 when you try to swing it it doesnt always swing but it did when i got him out
8004741 they had to go late no good swinging it all the way otherwise any good player would see it naturally i made it go late
8004742 eric never did much in his life but he just went up and bowled him
8004743 bradman hadnt had time to adjust himself to the light or anything but thats what the games all about when a new batsman comes in bowl it straight but eric was no good in australia he was terrible
8004744 we had lost the series hopelessly already what did it matter it matters a lot now though no one else will do it finish with a 100 average
8004745 we were friends i dont see no reason not to be i found them all a good lot of blokes
8004746 but donnie didnt go into social circles he stayed away from that i was friendly with him more because i was involved in management and on the committees as he was so i got to know him better then
8004747 i suppose it did he was brought up in the country youve got to imagine someone who was brought up in the outback who had never been anywhere it took him a while to adjust but it didnt do too much for affect his batting
8004748 i could talk to him about anything i just never told anyone about anything he said never wrote a word about it
8004749 he used to write me letters some people would try to sell them but i never could betray a confidence and never told anyone what he said
8004750 ive got some letters he wrote to me about when jessie was dying i wouldnt tell people about them ive kept three or four she was a lovely person his wife charming she was brought up in the country not far from him
8004751 how do you judge a player by how many runs he gets thats what the games about you talk about stylish cricketers and he wasnt a stylish batsman but you look at tonnes of people who are stylish batsmen and they didnt get so many runs
8004752 he was very broad minded when limited overs matches came he didnt decry them not the 50 overs cricket he would have scored anywhere he averaged about 40 runs an hour in test cricket and thats bloody quick

8004758 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004759 one way or the other there must be a political constitution that guarantees and secures the advances made by the government
8004760 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004761 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
8004762 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
8004763 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004764 has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here the usa and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
8004765 it has become harder and harder to grow our circulation over the past three years since windows mobile changed from being pdas to being phones pocket pc manufacturers like hp used to work with us to offer their customers a free issue of our magazine in their packaging the phone companies have not shown similar interest in working with us
8004766 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8004767 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8004768 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8004769 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8004770 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
8004771 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8004772 according to the villagers their enemies give false report to americans that foreign fighters were gathering in the village
8004773 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation
8004774 demand for high performance smart mobile devices continues to see strong growth globally and htc is well positioned to meet the varying needs of our diverse customer base
8004775 the htc s740 combines a powerful premium phone with a full slide out keypad in a compact and sleek form factor clearly one size does not fit all and the s740 will play an important role in expanding our growing portfolio of devices
8004776 you come across players like him only four or five times in a lifetime and as far as im concerned i want him at this football club
8004777 hes a gem a smashing lad but hes played too long for the under 21s and i know hes a lot better than that
8004778 coming off the back of a 3 0 home defeat to bristol city on saturday i could not have asked for more
8004779 i was delighted with the way we bounced back but then michael owen did what michael owen does best thats why hes a world class player

8004785 hi this is me this is my image and narrative will you be my friend hey thanks
8004786 giuseppe rossi has suffered a sprain in his left ankle during training this morning tuesday
8004787 the italian player was injured following an accidental collision with marcos senna and left the session to be attended to by medical staff
8004788 if all goes well his predicted recovery time will be between two to three weeks
8004789 firstly we must wait for the swelling to go down and the knee to return to its normal size later this week or next
8004790 then well search for a first class specialist to operate on him
8004791 what does concern me is the relationship that fernando torres and steven gerrard have achieved
8004792 they are two fine players and have a fine link something they have struck up very quickly as players it is very important to liverpool they know each others game very well
8004793 but then liverpool can be dangerous from every part of the field we will have to be very careful if i was 30 years younger i would love to be involved myself
8004794 over three or four years at steaua i cannot say to anyone that we were the best but we were beating the best
8004795 for standard to win here would be comparable to anything i achieved as a player at steaua
8004796 liverpool will be very responsible they will know their roles and what they have to do but maybe there is more responsibility on liverpool to win and to get through than there is for us
8004797 the pressure is on them maybe if we score it will become even more difficult and more pressure for them
8004798 i cannot see this game going to penalties we have to score they have to score so i expect both teams to attack
8004799 the champions league has the biggest respect and players need that attention for them to grow and improve we are in the champions league and aim to stay in it but if it has to be the uefa cup then we will take that just as seriously
8004800 we aim to profit from this moment it is our aim to learn and to progress in europe that is important for standard and also belgian football
8004801 the first match was full of high drama especially for us but at the end my players earned the respect of our fans but the biggest outcome of the night was that we won the respect of liverpool
8004802 i will be happy if i can say the same thing after the second leg regardless of the result that my players have earned the respect of everyone at liverpool
8004803 we have a very young side most of them have their whole careers ahead of them
8004804 i have told them that should enjoy the moment get as much out of it to help your future careers as you can
8004805 this preoccupation must be integrated and understood by the wto especially as concerns the doha negotiation cycle reputed to be e development cycle
8004806 that we shouldnt be fooled money from narco trafficking is not traveling in suitcases around the country it is deposited in banks
8004807 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8004808 herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8004809 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8004810 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8004811 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8004812 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8004813 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8004814 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8004815 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8004816 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8004817 i happen to semi know denver mayor hickenlooper because i belong to an all author rock band called the rock bottom remainders and when we performed in denver two years ago hickenlooper joined us on stage to sing the classic troggs song wild thing really he took the difficult vocal solo part that goes you moved me and he totally nailed it you would have sworn you were hearing an actual trogg the mayor got a nice round of applause from those audience members still able to clap without falling down i mention this story because i really like saying hickenlooper hickenlooper hickenlooper hickenlooper
8004818 i said that somebody was bound to ask me can you tell what it is yet we had a bit of a laugh about that
8004819 today we honor the women who gave all they had to become equal participants in our democracy suffragists like elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony saw beyond the limitations of legal restriction and cultural tradition and determined they would define themselves women have become one of the most powerful majorities in america and they serve in some of the highest offices and corporate board rooms in the land it was right and it was necessary that this nation paved the way for the full and free participation of women as citizens in our society

8004842 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8004843 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8004844 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8004845 were going to have to do some forensics on it
8004846 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
8004847 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8004848 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8004849 its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
8004850 russia today took a significant and negative step in recognizing the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia two separatist georgian provinces
8004851 i also remain deeply concerned about russias continued refusal to comply with the terms of the ceasefire ending hostilities with georgia
8004852 at a time of high energy prices and instability in global markets it is important to understand that events in georgia part of a strategic energy corridor affect individual lives far beyond the caucasus
8004853 there are some encouraging signs that our allies are responding to these events
8004854 it seems like a minor change but it really can impact peoples lives
8004855 for one thing a lot of our custodians have second jobs for another thing people have transportation and child care issues so we would like to make this change as gradual and as painless for our members as possible while still meeting the needs of our university
8004856 these custodians really work hard for us and we respect and depend on them to keep our campus going
8004857 we really thought this shift change would make our productivity with the same amount of people improved and im pretty confident that it will
8004858 at the same time we have some people who are saying this isnt working out for them so were going to see why that is and see if the trade off makes a difference
8004859 when were fighting 100 plus inches of snow and ice we think that four hour overlap from 10 30 p m to 2 30 a m is going to give us a much better response both in quality and quantity without having to pay overtime
8004860 eight hours of shoveling snow is eight hours of shoveling snow no matter when you start
8004861 also sometimes its better to start cleaning a building when people are still around they can tell you what needs to be cleaned up or tell you what not to touch
8004862 were hoping with the new chancellor that there might be a window of opportunity to do things differently and to not have such a contentious relationship with the uw
8004863 we want her to be aware that our people are really upset about this
8004864 like anything our relationship with our employees is always a dialogue
8004865 were listening to them and we will continue to evaluate this as we listen to feedback from our staff along the way so we think there are really good reasons to do this but it is a change and well keep the dialogue open with our staff
8004866 when he came home from school he discovered all of her personal property there but she wasnt there
8004867 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
8004868 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8004869 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
8004870 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
8004871 my candidate for the democratic nominee for president banged a sleazy gold digger while his wife was fighting terminal cancer and lied about it and destroyed his political future and all i got was this lousy t shirt
8004872 we did not defend properly on two occasions and it completely changed the face of the game
8004873 akinfenwa is a big strong lad and at times we did not handle him well enough at times we got too close to him and i am obviously unhappy about the result
8004874 a number of shots were fired from a vehicle into a house as a result an 18 year old male suffered gunshot wounds
8004875 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8004876 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8004877 we need to make sure the american people are compensated for the dispensation of their resources
8004878 surely sanctions cannot be good for any zimbabwean and we have abundant evidence of their ravaging impact we cannot condone such blatant spiteful injury
8004879 we are together in the struggle no amount of beatings and killings will deter us
8004880 i think were setting up a situation here where there could potentially be a lot of conflicts
8004881 these units are bigger than many of the surrounding homes
8004882 this is the first project thats been put inside a neighborhood and people are watching
8004883 destinamos todos nuestros recursos para ganar esas tres medallas y lo logramos
8004884 desaparece la actual polic a judicial y se inicia la conformaci n de la polic a investigadora del df

8004888 they found that 90 of the bats had signs of internal hemorrhaging but only half showed any signs of direct contact with the windmill blades
8004889 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8004890 we continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses
8004891 the overwhelming majority of banks 98 of them continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards
8004892 we believe institutions can and will step up to the plate to provide whatever insurance funds are needed
8004893 exploring going into the oil business in iraq and kazakhstan
8004894 consortium founded by turkish company ak group international potential backers include two turkish companies as well as kazakhstan
8004895 aks chief executive is aydan kodaloglu who like mr perle has been involved with the american turkish council an advocacy group in washington
8004896 serves as a board member of the american turkish council
8004897 while the atc is an association in name and in charter the reality is that it and other affiliated associations are the us government
8004898 organization s supposed to be promoting the cultural affairs of a certain country within another country
8004899 the central asia islamization cocktail mosques madrassas heroin amp terrorism
8004900 control of central asia particularly the oil and gas wealth as well as the strategic value of the region
8004901 this started more than a decade long illegal covert operation in central asia by a small group in the us intent on furthering the oil industry and the military industrial complex using turkish operatives saudi partners and pakistani allies furthering this objective in the name of islam
8004902 whats left of the ussr is a collapsed group of half failed states while the u s stands alone as the globes sole hyperpower
8004903 its birthday present appears to be another 100 million in budget cuts according to a defense department document
8004904 and this was on top of a 32 million loss the month before
8004905 both intellectually and financially a fabulous and alluring gravy train
8004906 a fertile area to further the science of death and destruction
8004907 darpa has been creating insect databases while increasing efforts to understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information
8004908 how long until they start thinking about weaponizing insects as well
8004909 that such creatures could be weaponized and the possibility according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project that these cyborg insects might be armed with bio weapons
8004910 a lead in applying state of the art technology for military capabilities and to prevent technological surprise from her adversaries
8004911 has been behind some of the worlds most revolutionary inventions
8004912 the internet the global positioning system stealth technology and the computer mouse
8004913 darpa has funded things that a lot of people thought were ridiculous and some that people thought were impossible they make things happen
8004914 the us is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels
8004915 enable submarines to engage elusive maneuvering land and sea targets
8004916 harness the insights and power of biology to make u s warfighters and their equipment more effective
8004917 understand how to use endemic insects as collectors of environmental information
8004918 this endemic insect system in key operational demonstrations here and abroad
8004919 we think we can use this concept to make smart weapons smarter
8004920 plan that reduces to an absolute minimum if not eliminates noncombatant casualties
8004921 help researchers in various disciplines self assemble into teams capable of developing plant inspired actuation systems that will ultimately have application in military adaptive or morphing structures
8004922 darpa supported researchers are studying how geckos climb walls and how an octopus hides to find new approaches to locomotion and highly adaptive camouflage the idea is to let nature be a guide toward better engineering
8004923 performance of rats birds and insects in performing missions of interest to dod such as exploration of caves or covert deposition of sensors
8004924 exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger more alert more endurant and better able to heal
8004925 investigating ways to prevent fatigue and enable soldiers to stay awake alert and effective for up to seven days straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects and without using any of the current generation of stimulants
8004926 the long term defense implications of finding ways to turn thoughts into acts if it can be developed are enormous imagine u s warfighters that only need use the power of their thoughts to do things at great distances
8004927 inspiration from nature will allow more life like qualities in the system
8004928 were interested in investigating biological organisms because they have evolved over many many years to be particularly good at surviving in the environment and we hope to learn from some of those strategies that mother nature has developed
8004929 damn sure it has got something to do with the actual burning of the dvd files
8004930 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8004931 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8004932 they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8004933 the confusion here is between john mccains rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on sen obama
8004934 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8004935 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8004936 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote
8004937 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8004938 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
8004939 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8004940 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8004941 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
8004942 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8004943 have you ever considered a wiki where you can submit content to the wiki via email since a lot of valuable content is in the emails it makes sense to have a smooth integration bjarke
8004944 stewart this article is proving to be a great resource for me i have been trying for a while to drive wiki adoption within my organization and lately ive gotten some interest i hope to use this list as a blueprint for expanding the wiki to additional use cases beyond our current project thanks
8004945 kris thanks for sharing your experience you make an excellent point getting enough content in a wiki to make it relevant for the elephants to relate to key to wiki success and youre right adoption is easier and smoother after that
8004946 darek hi darek thanks for your nice comment i totally believe in the bottom up approach too thats great that some in your organization just went for it i would have liked to have done that but in an organization that doesnt have a wiki and requires supervisor approval for internet access this approach
8004947 i have kept these horses safe for you when i found them here and you have given me my reward for i have three sons by you now tell me what i am to do with them when they grow up shall i settle them here in this country of which i am mistress or send them to you
8004948 you will not be far wrong if you do what i will now tell you whichever of them you find can draw this bow as i do and put on this girdle in the way i will show you should be settled here in this country but any of them who fail to do these two things must be sent away do this and you will not only show proper obedience to me but find happiness for yourself as well
8004949 i think i bring a lot to this competition that might give me an advantage im saying i really want this i think im creative and unique
8004950 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell
8004951 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8004952 youve taken a lot of heat for the tv ad comparing barack obama to paris hilton
8004953 let me say that i have the utmost respect for the hilton family i first became acquainted with them when i had an extended stay at one of their southeast asia properties in 1967
8004954 do you still stand by your statement that the u s should stay in iraq for 100 years if necessary
8004955 time is relative my friend sometimes five and a half years can seem like an eternity when you have to eat gravel for sunday brunch and you receive a bamboo manicure three times a day
8004956 youve criticized joe bidens suggestion that iraq be divided in to three separate states why is that
8004957 it was next to impossible to escape a north vietnamese prison camp suppose i had succeeded only to be captured by east or west vietnamese forces
8004958 what do you think the proper american response to the russia georgian crisis should have been
8004959 first and foremost we should have established a no fly zone over the entire area believe me you dont want to fly over any place hostilities are taking place you could get shot down and spend time in a pow camp which take it from me is no picnic
8004960 for many americans losing their home to foreclosure is a very real an immiment threat what would you do to ease the situation
8004961 i would suggest as a temporary measure that those who have lost or will lose their homes band together and live in barracks for awhile it may seem uncomfortable at first but believe me they seem like the connaught or at least the savoy when compared to a 3x5 cement cell where the continental breakfast consists of feces served at the end of a bayonett
8004962 your wife cindy is stunning she certainly is an asset to your campaign
8004963 dont even think about it buster you may be half my age but i spent over five years of hell undergoing torture that would make a mute spill the bans and ill bust you one right in the chops if you so much as look at her the wrong way even if it lands me in the hole for six months
8004964 speaking of age youve tried to allay concerns about your own by stating that you will one serve one term if elected do you stand by that
8004965 did i mention that i spent five and a half years in a north vietnamese prison camp and this was during the viet nam war
8004966 we had lost confidence in our culture everything had to be demolished we would begin again after the tabula rasa at the cabaret voltaire we began by shocking common sense public opinion education institutions museums good taste in short the whole prevailing order
8004967 ridiculous is a better way to understand todays world than serious i see you john stewart whats more obscene calling waterboarding a thrill ride or not calling it torture
8004968 been prosecuted by us military courts as torture for over 100 years since the spanish american war after world war ii us military commissions prosecuted and severely punished enemy soldiers for having subjected american prisoners to waterboarding in its annual country reports on human rights practices the state department has consistently condemned other countries for waterboarding
8004969 we are the only university in the world we know of running sap with ibm db2 on the mainframe
8004970 we like to be a leader in enterprise computing in the mainframe environment
8004971 the combination of theory and practice is much better than just talking about it
8004972 hands on experience is critical for students to have a competitive advantage in the marketplace
8004973 we are the only university in the world we know of running sap with ibm db2 on the mainframe
8004974 we like to be a leader in enterprise computing in the mainframe environment
8004975 the combination of theory and practice is much better than just talking about it

8004977 special report anna nicole smith who would she have voted for
8004978 a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves to do for themselves to have different ideas and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order this is what will happen to you you will be lynched destroyed caricatured
8004979 in idaho we had a 15 3 win in terms of delegates and in new jersey she had a 59 48 win
8004980 so we got a greater net gain out of idaho than she got in new jersey
8004981 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8004982 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
8004983 i used to work as a day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
8004984 we will not abandon our work if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaida would take full control over our area
8004985 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8004986 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8004987 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8004988 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8004989 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8004990 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8004991 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8004992 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8004993 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8004994 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8004995 are how we engage and why we should engage young people in politics
8004996 the democratic party has perfected how to win and not why we should win
8004997 hks saw a 50 jump in applications following 9 11 and this higher level has been sustained ever since
8004998 some of the expenses claimed by defendant clearly should have been deleted by the court
8004999 mr strahan is gratified with the result and feels his legal position has been vindicated
8005000 he hopes the matter can be resolved amicably going forward in the interests of his children
8005001 it looks like we are slowly starting to dig out of this
8005002 he tells her to get out of bed or im going to kill you and your kids
8005003 the intruder then tied her up and sexually assaulted her
8005004 she doesnt know if it the assault was the result of the eviction or not
8005005 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8005006 and i will be praying for your heart to heal because the truth is he may never come back

8005009 the huge marketing myth everyone swears by is that backend sales are made to your customers only months sometimes years after the initial sale its not true and the speed and power of the internet enables you to compress your marketing cycle

8005013 in the last few weeks not only one but two ipod repair shops have been accused of shameful customer service and even outright fraud and we want customers to know that not all ipod repair companies behave this way
8005014 it bothers us greatly to hear that folks may have been taken advantage of by a few companies under the guise of good service when all they were trying to do was have their ipod or iphone fixed
8005015 this is just our way of assisting people that may have been taken advantage of and giving them some form of compensation even though our company had nothing to do with the situation in the first place
8005016 where does tom delay go to get his reputation back where does america go to get two years of a democrat majority in congress back

8005020 in the resuscitation of integrity as a culture and value that we cherish the icpc will not leave out mobilization against the activities of these fraudsters wherever they may be
8005021 the strategy of icpc in the fight against corruption is to influence the mind and attitude of our people not by fear of punishment or intimidation but by robust and purposive education on the vice
8005022 the icpc appreciates its partnership with splash fm which we are inaugurating today because it is a partnership that will carry the fight against corruption to greater heights the proprietors of splash fm have demonstrated their readiness to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in the fight against corruption they have claimed a leadership role by this gesture not only that by subscribing to the integrity first initiative a standard setting mechanism of the icpc they have demonstrated courage to practice integrity

8005044 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
8005045 were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long
8005046 im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
8005047 i was afraid of obama the first time i saw him

8005058 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
8005059 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8005060 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
8005061 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
8005062 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
8005063 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
8005064 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now

8005087 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8005088 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8005089 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8005092 the human mind is not capable of grasping the universe we are like a little child entering a huge library the walls are covered to the ceilings with books in many different tongues the child knows that someone must have written these books it does not know who or how it does not understand the languages in which they are written but the child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books a mysterious order which it does not comprehend but only dimly suspects
8005093 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
8005094 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

8005096 the overall poverty rate in minnesota has actually gotten worse despite those years of economic growth
8005097 child poverty rates have remained unchanged over time so that tells us that the economy is growing but not everyone is sharing in the benefits of that economic growth
8005098 the longterm trend there is that kids living in poverty on average dont do well in school tend to drop out and it has a major impact on our workforce development productivity cost to society due to crime is enormous
8005099 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8005100 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8005101 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension

8005111 todd knows hans because todd works at the heritage foundation and hans contributes to the heritage foundation he has written some things about voting rights
8005112 we have never seen a political appointee exercise this level of control over the day to day operations of the voting section
8005113 voting rights policies not seen before pushing to curb minor instances of election fraud by imposing sweeping restrictions that would make it harder not easier for democratic leaning poor and minority voters to cast ballots
8005114 we have two reports dealing with voting rights that are yet to be published and my concern is what role he will have in regard to those reports
8005115 does not have any more work to be done on the voting rights briefing
8005116 two months may not be much time for him to do damage
8005117 but the symbolism is much more damaging because of the message it sends to the people were supposed to be protecting
8005118 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
8005119 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
8005120 there are still a chunk of union voters who are undecided and there are some who are nervous about him
8005121 we feel that race is an issue its not the only issue its complicated by other issues such as unfamiliarity and inexperience but it is an issue
8005122 what the barack obama campaign needs to do is tell his story
8005123 barack obama has got to meet more with workers and go out into the schools and the factories and show them he is concerned about the situation theyre in
8005124 its all those other blue collared workers who are not members of unions that hes going to have problems with
8005125 but if he can convince us itll make it easier to convince the rest of them
8005126 the continual efforts by the scientific community to develop an accurate estimate of whats out there
8005127 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed

8005192 there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the ice sea and tundra
8005193 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg

8005199 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8005219 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8005220 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8005221 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8005222 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8005223 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of

8005290 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8005291 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8005292 they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8005293 the confusion here is between john mccains rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on sen obama
8005294 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8005295 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8005296 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote
8005297 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8005298 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
8005299 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8005300 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8005301 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
8005302 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome

8005312 i respect hillary and i thought she was a great candidate but im not going to blindly follow whoever she tells me to throw my support behind
8005313 you look at what it means for tax policy and the economy when i think what mccain wants to do it reminds of having that tv land channel on the one that keeps showing the reruns of leave it to beaver because its just going to be four more years of the same
8005314 its going to be like gilligans island we never get off the island

8005389 theres definitely a hierarchy in the types of activities that happen in online crime i would put things like 419 scams an advance fee fraud usually by nigerian fraudsters on the lower end of it they are very easy to mount and you dont need much technical sophistication to make the attack work
8005390 but as you get into slightly higher levels you might get phishing attacks where the criminals have to put up a web site and do a little bit more work to make money and then at an even higher level you have to do more work on developing malicious software and trying to get those on peoples machines to steal their credentials that way that requires even more technical sophistication
8005391 even the highest levels beyond that you start to get to people who are doing very targeted attacks
8005392 they are really being very careful about what they are doing and theyre very slick they go in there do their work and get back out theyre very much under the radar
8005393 like any other organized crime group they have few people at the very top where the money is being funneled up to and as you go down to the bottom of the hierarchy there are lots of foot soldiers they even advertise for particular technical skills
8005394 youve got one guy doing apache security mods modifications that are hacks in this case of the apache web server and another guy is doing social engineering campaigns and another guy is writing smtp mailers email spam and another guy is doing money mule operations and work at home schemes
8005395 so one of them may be part of one operation and part of a second operation and part of another operation all at the same time
8005396 its really confusing that way to identify whos pulling the strings
8005397 his name is a brand his kits are of the highest quality
8005398 mr brain became famous when he introduced a free phishing kit instead of paying for it you get a free kit but what he didnt tell you is that hidden in the code of the kit whatever information your victim types into your phishing site he gets a copy of so the way you paid for your kit was that you got a copy of everything that you convinced people to enter into your site
8005399 he is very public he has his own blog up but he doesnt sell his wares publicly anymore because he has a standard set of clients his clients are really the ones who are doing the damage but he supplies them with the tools
8005400 his clients are much more shadowy whereas he is very open he says no these are legitimate tools nothing im doing is illegal but we know that he does not have a full time job and makes lots of money basically we see his fingerprints on these customized backdoor programs that are used in attacks all the time
8005401 the most prolific the most profitable and probably the most dangerous ones are operating out of russia and the ukraine
8005402 while russia is good at financial fraud and credit carding and that type of thing the south american trojans are about automated man in the middle defeating two factor authentication type attacks
8005403 its a culture of web site break in and disablement the criminals trade information on what servers are running what software what versions and what kind of exploits work against those servers
8005404 they dont have to exploit them because they dont want to tip their hands but they have lists of them and can tell you exactly how to exploit them when you need to break into a server and use it as a command and control for a botnet
8005405 the names change often they are just more nebulous and theyre a little bit harder for us to track
8005406 we just dont have as much visibility into their network so anything they do internally in china kind of remains a secret and its hard for us to really track development of specific groups
8005407 especially in parts of asia game play is huge and in some games it takes up to 800 hours of skilled play to get to the top levels and people dont like that
8005408 says ken dunham director of global response for isight partners
8005409 so things purchased within a virtual world have a real monetary value to them and in fact there have been issues with money being laundered through these programs
8005410 most of these operations are geared toward for profit the gangs dont want to take down the infrastructure by denial of service attacking it off the face of the earth because if they take down the infrastructure it makes it a lot harder to reach into somebodys back pocket without their knowing it to steal their money
8005411 so theyd prefer to fly under the radar as best they can to try to go as unnoticed as they can and exploit the opportunity presented to them at any given time
8005412 you have a lot of smaller bit players who are individuals operating on their own but i think theres very much a one sided world in cybercrime where theres a very small number of groups who are responsible for a large percentage of the activity
8005413 there will be two or three of them and later on therell be another member and different members will drop out or theyll change their name entirely but it will be the same three guys
8005414 i wish it were easier that there were some identifiable quote unquote gangs but unfortunately theres not
8005415 several operations are ongoing and have global footprints that are all interconnected more or less were pretty much referring to the same operatives every time because a lot of the same guys who are behind some of this stuff have their fingers in multiple pots
8005416 you know when you have serial killer who has tell tale signs it is a similar thing with these groups sometimes they have similar signatures we can use to recognize that theyre the ones responsible for an attack
8005417 it is hard to say which is the most dangerous hacking group
8005418 i think when youre talking about threat agents and cybercrime activity two big factors in determining whos really the biggest threat are how good are they technically and their institutional knowledge if they attack u k banks how well do they know how the u k banking systems work and how their online banking services are implemented and where their weaknesses are
8005419 hur skulle det vara om du inte gjorde de d r sakerna om du ins g att du faktiskt inte beh ver g ra det

8005422 these detainees were determined to be eligible for transfer following a comprehensive series of review processes
8005423 the transfer is a demonstration of the united states desire not to hold detainees any longer than necessary
8005424 we are making a concerted effort to reduce the population at guantanamo
8005425 german carmakers want co2 targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years its the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non smokers
8005426 they have these young guys that can really pressure the passer i think cb terence newman is playing really well right now he had high expectations coming out of college and i think he is living up to those expectations now on the other side they have some injuries to both corners that are playing that spot and we are not sure which guy we are going to see with the play of their safeties and the pressure they are putting on their quarterback i actually just read something in sports illustrated an interview or quote with newman had said that because of the pass pressure the secondary all of a sudden looks a lot better and i think that is very evident when you can generate a pass rush with your down four or a combination of stunts with your linebackers that helps your secondary and i think right now they are able to create that pressure without having to over analyze or commit to many guys to the pass rush when you can drop guys in coverage and be able to still get pressure that will cause problems for any team
8005427 i think our defense is playing better than have played the entire time i have been here i think it has been a growing process with a lot of young guys who have stepped up and played extremely well obviously de jared allen and lb kawika mitchell those two guys are the ones that really jumped up on the guys they have really developed over the last couple of seasons and really played well we have good veteran leadership over there with de eric hicks and cb sammy knight cb patrick surtain and s greg wesley there are a lot of veteran guys that are playing really well and i think they just have a lot of confidence right now i think they feel good about what they are doing they feel good about way gunther cunningham is approaching the game and giving them opportunity to have success when you get that confidence you think you are going to go out every time and make plays no matter where the team has the ball whether it be a special teams or turnover on the offense where all of a sudden you are on a short field when you have that confidence its just more fun to play and it seems like they are having a lot more fun in years past it was almost like lets go out and do as best we can and hopefully nothing goes wrong now its like when they take the field it seems like lets go out here and make something happen and obviously from an offensive standpoint and from a fan standpoint its just a lot more fun to see them go out with that type of attitude
8005428 im not up here for paychecks im here to win
8005429 you want to be successful on every play but there comes a point when a play has reached its potential and you either chuck it out of bounds or take the sack and not turn it over
8005430 its a battle i have fought my entire career that is my challenge
8005431 we are thrilled to be selected as a finalist in the red herring canada top 50 safety compliance is becoming a growing concern for companies of all sizes due to increasing liability and compliance requirements our safety compliance and inspection management product suite field id is revolutionizing the process and creating safer work environments around the world we are delighted that the editors have acknowledged our innovation and leadership

8005433 we are very pleased with the progress made during the second quarter of 2008 towards commercial production as we signed a long term canola seed supply agreement with viterra canadas largest handler of grain and oilseeds contracted for and broke ground on the construction of the 44 000 square foot building in saskatoon and subsequent to the end of the second quarter signed a long term commercial sales agreement with shafer commodities inc to purchase all of the canola meal produced at our saskatoon facility
8005434 our team has put forth a tremendous effort to maintain our intended cost budgets and timelines while at the same time planning for all foreseeable contingencies
8005435 we respect that many companies in western canada have incurred cost and schedule overruns due to the high economic activity in that region but at present bioexx is pleased to report that it remains on plan and sees little risk of any significant delays or overruns
8005436 we knew the tempe marketplace water features would include a very popular childrens splash pad but we also added drama with waterfalls backlit by fire elements and color changing lighting overall the water features add to the inviting and upscale feel of this community marketplace and invite relaxation
8005437 i have so much fun using the splash pad as a backdrop for my childrens pictures
8005438 she did a fantastic job and is well deserving of the silver medal
8005439 thats when it dawned on me that emilie really is an example to entrepreneurs
8005440 first off you have to be trained in your profession but what sets successful entrepreneurs apart is how they think
8005441 when its your business everything falls on your shoulders if youre not mentally equipped to handle that it spells business disaster
8005442 were known as the bookkeepers advocate in that everything we do is dedicated to making our members professional lives better but our support goes beyond providing the basics of being a better bookkeeper we help our members become better business people we help them make that mental shift thats so crucial to entrepreneurial success
8005443 within just a couple weeks he had his first group of clients and has never looked back

8005445 the quality of the filmmakers represented in this seasons lineup is amazing we have two masters of the form albert maysles grey gardens from east hampton to broadway and jon else wonders are many the making of doctor atomic and new films from dynamic talents like brett morgen chicago 10 and stacy peralta made in america
8005446 and were thrilled to be welcoming back veteran independent lens filmmakers patrick creadon i o u s a and johnny symons ask not along with new discoveries that are incredibly exciting like the work of gonzalo arijon whose film stranded the andes plan crash survivors has astounded audiences around the world
8005447 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8005448 no what i wanna do is what every bird does in its nest it forces the kids to go out there and figure it out for themselves by the way in terms of an inheritance and stuff theyre gonna be taken care of but they will never be rich off my money because every year they should be forced to get up out of bed and go out and work and make their own way
8005449 there is the possibility that paradise lost may still be performing their shows in south america this year the band are currently doing everything possible to find a replacement drummer in time to play these shows while nothing is definite at the moment we will update you with further information as it becomes available
8005450 possibly but a lot of the time its not down to the songwriting its more down to production the last few albums up to in requiem its been very vocally orientated the vocals have been high in the mix and weve kind of kept the drums and guitars down lower with the last one we wanted to make a point of bringing the guitars and the drums up again which is kinda what metal productions are really loud drums and guitars we really made a point of doing that this time and as a result it instantly sounds heavier well probably do even moreso on the next one because were still in that mindset each album you try and better your last one and thats what everybody does sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but we want to take it even more extreme and probably make the most extreme album weve ever done
8005451 well weve always been about writing songs well hopefully be writing good and melodic songs but hopefully yeah with a bit more heaviness in there too
8005452 were actually working on it right now were working on the material and were looking at going into the studio round about january
8005453 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point cease fire agreement which president medvedev signed on aug 12 2008
8005454 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8005455 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8005456 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
8005457 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history

8005486 the people gave the power to the governor and the governor shall not abuse it
8005487 if we change the rules now as youre asking us to do what is the status of all of these judges that have been appointed by governors are they illegally holding office
8005488 because as in most places where the law reaches a crossroads and we turn and go in a different direction its not retroactive
8005489 why cant that be debated among the candidates and brought to the attention of the voter as either an advantage or a disadvantage to the incumbent
8005490 i think youve just pointed out why its a financial advantage to the incumbent to have it printed on the ballot
8005491 as justice scalia said in one of the opinions we quoted the ballot is the last thing the voter sees before they vote the challenger would have to spend a lot of money to get out to the electorate educate them about the whole incumbency issue
8005492 a group or class of persons enjoying superior intellectual social or economic status
8005493 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8005494 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8005495 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8005496 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8005497 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8005498 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8005499 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8005500 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8005501 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know
8005502 this is a good chance for our defensive line to go out and add up on the sack category and get some good hits on the guy
8005503 its all a matter of how well their offensive line protects
8005504 theyre doing what they can to keep him healthy and keep him protected and get the ball down the field at the same time
8005505 hes not a big concern when hes rolling out of the pocket hes taken a lot of hits during his career thats what hes known for hes going to take some sacks and yet hes a playmaker he makes big plays with his arm
8005506 i know it doesnt make bill happy and if it doesnt make bill happy it wont make that team happy
8005507 bill has a great way of applying pressure from a leadership standpoint believe me i know a lot of players who play for bill feel that pressure and then they play better thats his style hes a great leader
8005508 hes made it abundantly clear to everyone that what weve done in the past two weeks isnt nearly close to our expectation level which is still up there there was a lot of intensity on the practice field today both from him and the coaching staff to correct the mistakes that have set us back the last two weeks
8005509 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8005510 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8005511 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8005512 you wake up in the morning and its your first news of the day it just kind of hits you
8005513 for me i spent so much time with that young man and had so much success with him it really hurt its almost like losing a brother
8005514 we are very pleased with our relationship with all of the placees mineralfields group mtax 2008 mineral limited partnership augen capital corp and dundee securities
8005515 we look forward to working with them as we continue to develop our holdings in british columbia
8005516 overall the soft economic environment continues to adversely affect the business particularly with respect to certain high ticket discretionary items and home related categories while a number of our product categories performed well such as kids crafts jewelry amp bead making and bakeware sales declines in home related categories including floral home d cor and custom framing businesses more than offset these increases on a comparable store basis
8005517 with the halloween fall and holiday seasons approaching our focus will be squarely on the customer our goal is to provide a compelling product assortment and excellent execution in our stores while conservatively managing our expense structure and inventory commitments we will however continue to invest time and resources towards our key strategic initiatives such as our consumer insight and category management programs in order to assure the long term growth and success of the michaels brand

8005521 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8005522 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8005523 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8005524 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8005525 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8005526 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis

8005531 this initiative will provide seamless application integration using zigbee or homeplug devices providing the flexibility utilities need when implementing ami and smart metering programs
8005532 mainstream market adoption of a common technology accelerates our ability to empower our customers to manage their energy usage
8005533 the integration of a common application layer across these technologies will allow a common certification process which is critical for plug and play interoperability
8005534 without such integration it will not be possible to scale energy efficiency applications and services
8005535 zigbee smart energy was developed by utility companies product manufacturers and technology suppliers so it makes perfect sense to leverage that collaboration
8005536 expediting the rollout of energy management and efficiency programs that help everyone better manage their energy use is our common goal and the zigbee alliance is proud to play a key role in this process
8005537 with more than 20 million homeplug enabled products in use on six continents homeplug technology is the leading global standard for power line networks
8005538 as utilities and access providers aggressively deploy homeplug technology in applications around the world for electric grid management automatic meter reading applications and demand response bpl and command and control applications continue to be a driving force for the alliance

8005547 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
8005548 if what we think does not reflect truth then what we feel must not reflect reality
8005549 how long must i wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart how long will my enemy triumph over me i trust in your unfailing love my heart rejoices in your salvation i will sing to the lord for he has been good to me
8005550 while the housing and credit crunch have had serious ramifications for many consumers all is not lost
8005551 the economy will regain its footing eventually but consumers must be realistic and live within their financial means now going back to the basics of budgeting and credit use can help consumers adjust spending habits to help prevent a temporary economic hardship from having a permanent impact on their family
8005552 its important to seek help from a trusted source if you feel yourself getting in over your head dont wait until your home and your familys security is on the line to ask for help

8005585 it was great spectrum that had been set aside only for aviation use
8005586 any democrat or republican who said they were going to support us on health care or free choice and turns against us is going to paint a target
8005587 were not going to just win this election and hope barack obama does well people want something to happen
8005588 our members are sick and tired of politicians who are after their votes the day before the election and after their throats
8005589 for our members politics is not about democrats or republicans or left or right its about right and wrong
8005590 its a very definite chilling affect on free speech its definitely a chilling affect on peoples rights to document whats happening around them
8005591 if they persist in keeping our equipment and get away with it its definitely a victory for corruption of police
8005592 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas vp text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
8005593 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients
8005594 here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his vp pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers
8005595 women have a critical choice to make this november between barack obama who will protect their rights as president and john mccain who wants to overturn roe v wade and even opposes equal pay legislation
8005596 as we celebrate this historic anniversary of womens suffrage here in new hampshire i think there is no better way for unregistered women to raise their voices than to get to their town clerks and register to vote
8005597 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the u s
8005598 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8005599 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8005600 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead
8005601 in barack obama we have a proven reformer frankly john mccain is too

8005802 the growth of this outreach is a reflection of the excitement that people are expressing about the many ways 40 days for life impacts a community this program is being embraced by cities conducting their first 40 days for life and those who are planning their second third or in the case of bryan college station texas fourth campaign

8005824 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8005825 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
8005826 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
8005827 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8005828 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8005829 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8005830 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8005831 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8005832 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8005833 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8005834 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8005835 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8005836 you wake up in the morning and its your first news of the day it just kind of hits you
8005837 for me i spent so much time with that young man and had so much success with him it really hurt its almost like losing a brother
8005838 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8005839 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8005840 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8005841 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8005842 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8005843 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8005844 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8005845 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8005846 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8005847 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8005848 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8005849 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8005850 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8005851 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8005852 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8005853 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing
8005854 i never really like talking too much about an injury because if you play well they say man look how tough he is
8005855 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday

8005859 it could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury we dont know that yet jeff has some options but we dont know how bad it is and it could be through this weekend before we know for sure
8005860 we have made significant improvements to our products and services and now is the time to invest in brand awareness and begin to aggressively promote our product offerings

8005865 we all have blind spots and a colleague can see those for you
8005866 sometimes the trickier a student is to work with the more colleagues you need to help you see your own blind spots
8005867 one of the fundamental beliefs i have is if you get people together to agree what the most important things are and you have a common commitment to work together to see that students learn those things then i think the outside assessments take care of themselves
8005868 do you believe in love at first sight ohh then i will walk by again

8005873 john sununu and his political buddies spend will millions of dollars to distort sununus disastrous record of supporting george bushs failed economic agenda
8005874 the truth team is a resource for reporters and voters to get the facts and learn the truth the choice in this senate race is between john sununus record of marching in lockstep with george bushs failed economic agenda and jeanne shaheen promise of a new direction and sununus millions cant distract from that fact
8005875 2 do not just clean out your refrigerator clean it
8005876 then i got up early yesterday and rewrote the whole thing
8005877 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8005878 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8005879 the gps units continue to be one of the hot commodities

8005897 we have found that simi activists were trained in kota where a large simi network has been exposed before carrying out the may 13 blasts more information will be available only after questioning hussain at length
8005898 the camps were similar to the one held in pavagadh near vadodara before the ahmedabad blasts activists here were trained in arms and were indoctrinated
8005899 sajid mansuri accused in the ahmedabad terror strikes led us to hussain we have also arrested seven others from kota on monday who knew mansuri and could have been involved in the terror strike
8005900 we believe the planning was done in one city the bombs made in another the terror networks presence has been seen in gujarat karnataka madhya pradesh uttar pradesh and rajasthan

8005916 your daughters right to make decisions about her own body doesnt matter because i didnt get my way and hillary is not the nominee
8005917 the life of your son who will need to be drafted into the next mccain war means nothing to me because i didnt get my way

8005919 your ability to keep your house means nothing to me because i didnt get my way
8005920 communities affected by job losses mean nothing to me because hillary is not our nominee
8005921 i mean god whats the choice you have someone like mccain who doesnt know what he stands for and someone who works from the grassroots which is what were supposed to stand for
8005922 is going to have to pick up a fungo bat and hit john mccain with it

8005928 isd recognizes the need for increased awareness and ongoing vigilance to protect the computer systems and networks used by state government
8005929 by proactively reducing security risks today isd may expand the number of on line services with the confidence that they are secure from compromise
8005930 over the past eleven years ics has consistently helped secure and support many of the largest it infrastructures in the world ranging from the federal government to state and local agencies to global enterprises
8005931 we are proud to provide the state of alabama with world class it security and technical consulting services to enhance their ability to provide premier services to alabamas state government and its citizens
8005932 barack obama understands that u s attention and support will be required to solidify the peace but he also recognizes that the crisis period for northern ireland has passed and that the people of northern ireland are now in charge of their own destiny
8005933 he will consult with the taoiseach the british prime minister and party leaders in northern ireland to determine whether a special u s envoy for northern ireland continues to be necessary or whether a senior administration official serving as point person for northern ireland would be most effective
8005934 has continued to be an integral part of the united states engagement in northern ireland and ireland itself
8005935 most irish american activists are looking with great alarm at this statement because what it signals is what appears to be a sense of detachment from ireland and the irish issues by the potential obama administration
8005936 ive been involved with irish american issues before bill clinton and i will be now and after i am certainly not for sen mccain im a lifelong democrat im looking at this as an irish american democrat with great alarm as is the rest of the irish american community
8005937 ill create 5 million jobs from out of unicorn farts and pixie dust
8005938 the ex first lady of canada on the men shes loved
8005939 it was sexuality without being overt it was quite beautiful and casual
8005940 the photo shoots got a lot brighter over the years
8005941 the irony of electing men who objectify women for a living as arbiters and executors of female desire is playgirls day to day reality
8005942 when i first started there had to be a penis on every page
8005943 i was like are you kidding women dont want that
8005944 but they wanted more nudity i got the first redesigned issue back from them with a tab on each of the pages where there was a penis and they were like theres only seven and i thought you know out of a 96 page magazine sevens plenty
8005945 the roles are exactly reversed as far as democrat vs republican but there are great similarities
8005946 the current war is a republican war and so the anger is at bush and against the other camp so the political analogy is very different
8005947 in the background in 68 was this tremendous upheaval years in the making
8005948 it had a political edge starting with the civil rights movement it had a cultural edge with drugs and long hair and all kinds of alienation
8005949 the beginning of the great reversal where a political majority was to be made
8005950 looking back there were a lot of folks who were outside the union oriented socially conservative democratic party looking to take it over and they took it over
8005951 and these protesters just kind of spread away it was like the red sea parted
8005952 i know full well that john mccain and his people have to be anguishing about how they handle bush at their convention
8005953 im sure the republicans are trying to figure how to have bush at that convention and get the benefit with some of the people mccain needs without hurting him in the election 65 days away
8005954 the policies of tomorrow need not be limited by the policies of today
8005955 first of all during that spring and summer we have two major assassinations by the time the convention rolls around the democrats are going into the convention with an enormous amount of division within the party
8005956 humphrey has the support of course of the johnson administration but for that reason hes enormously controversial to anyone who opposes the vietnam war so from the outset theres absolutely no unity in the party and it devolves from there into chaos
8005957 within the protesters you have everything you can imagine people who are there solely to peacefully protest the war all the way to people like jerry rubin and abbie hoffman who deliberately came to undermine the democrats
8005958 so i saw this march of people marching against the war in vietnam and of course my heart was with them i was opposed to the war as well so i joined the march
8005959 it was just a sense of joy and celebration that slipped over the crowd it was a celebration of having our voice heard
8005960 i looked down on the crowd that i had been in only minutes before and at the far right end at the end of the block i saw these policemen in military formation and as they approached that crowd they picked up speed and they started running into that crowd with their nightsticks swinging it was awful i just i couldnt believe that this was happening in our country i broke down and started crying i could not believe what i was seeing
8005961 it was a police riot it was a police riot and the demonstrators reacted to that police riot there would have never been the chaos that occurred had it not been for that police riot
8005962 i think there are a thousand stories to answer that if you look at the numbers estimates are there were probably about 5 000 protesters you have about 12 000 police that daly had put on the streets and another 5 000 to 10 000 in national guard and army
8005963 but the consensus really is and this is confirmed by a report in the aftermath of chicago that the police riot was really the story that was going on that the police were really looking for a fight
8005964 and it affirms in peoples minds i think the sense that the democratic party is imploding that its an organization that is incoherent that it cant contain itself
8005965 most historians have come to the conclusion that 68 really does fuel the rise of a conservative revolution
8005966 we learned that the young can make a difference that if the young are passionate that if they are peaceful and non violent that they do impact that was number one but number two we learned that we ought not to be afraid of peaceful demonstration
8005967 when everything started to hit the fan i became more involved
8005968 from the beginning to the end of the convention it was a debacle
8005969 i think one of the great tragedies of our time is when richard nixon beat him
8005970 i never wanted to go to another democratic national convention
8005971 i was there when some history was in the making
8005972 rumsfeld said that he felt had chicago city officials provided a place for the hippies yippies and objectors to the vietnam war for their meetings and conferences perhaps the situation in downtown chicago would not have arisen
8005973 i was struck by the fact that it was extraordinarily serious and its impact on the campaign would be significant
8005974 it was tough enough for senator humphrey in the campaign and this made it of course even tougher
8005975 the hallways were just filled with demonstrators and signs and everything else
8005976 a lot of demonstrators were sitting in the hallways talking to each other
8005977 then television lights would come on and demonstrators would leap up and start waving their signs and chanting and so forth until the television lights went off theyd stop demonstrating and sat back down they chatted with each other and chatted with everybody else
8005978 we were there to show the governor in his best light and thats what we tried to do
8005979 theyd take us from our hotel to the convention on a bus and when wed pass the protesters in the park the bus would get pelted with tomatoes
8005980 while people were talking to the convention you could watch the riots going on outside
8005981 i was on patrol on the day john kennedys boat was hit we got back to our base when we heard about it
8005982 we ran down to the shore and saw a native dugout coming through the water and there was kennedy hidden under the leaves and bananas
8005983 they had to hide him to get him past the japanese lookouts
8005984 when i saw a job opening for boy scout executive in boulder i took it
8005985 daley would come in each day with a bunch of followers and sit in the front row
8005986 if george mcgovern were president we wouldnt have these gestapo tactics in the streets of chicago
8005987 showed to me that the solid fabric of american political life and even society itself could be undone
8005988 then i would walk make my way through all the extracurricular activity going on to get to the conrad hilton and elbow my way through the mob of people in the lobby and somehow get down some steps
8005989 one or two hours of sleep before you were up and at it again
8005990 police cars would come screaming down the street and skid to a stop just like in the movies
8005991 and two officers would jump out and they would have clubs and everything else and theyd take off after about 10 or 12 protestors milling around i remember a lot of protesters running into alleys and the police running after them michigan avenue being lit up like daylight with the searchlights
8005992 i wore summer suits then and that identified me to them as part of the establishment
8005993 chicagos police have been beating innocent people with reckless abandon
8005994 i remember i got a letter from him in which he said that he and the others in his marine division were aware of what happened in chicago
8005995 as he was going for the helicopter he got picked off
8005996 i was torn between being a young somewhat liberal reporter and yet having great empathy for what was going on in vietnam and for our men and women serving there in action
8005997 what impelled this book what i wanted to do was a meditation on age and the changes that happen and memories that happened

8006008 why is it that you were saved and your neighbor next door was not
8006009 why did you repent want to turn from your old ways while your neighbor did not want to
8006010 i guess i trusted jesus and repented of my sins because my heart was humble enough to see my need of salvation outside of myself while my neighbor remained stubborn in his pride and sin
8006011 and where did this extra humility come from why was it that you had more humility then your neighbor

8006089 it is reassuring to have independent nickel shareholders publicly supporting our efforts and we thank mr kalt for coming forward although not in writing victory nickel has also received indications of support from other shareholders we encourage other shareholders to follow mr kalts lead and make their views known to independent nickels special committee of directors formed to consider the offer
8006090 like independent nickel victory nickel is an emerging nickel mining leader with both valuable assets and great people i strongly hold the opinion that victorys offer to acquire independent is a good offer for independent investors moreover i believe it delivers an opportunity rich outcome that is capable of large value creation for all stakeholders of the proposed entity

8006104 the variety of projects includes water conservation efficiency and water market projects and demonstrates the importance of this bureau of reclamation program in looking toward future water needs

8006111 first we try to salute under appreciated american playwrights who have recently died levin passed away earlier this year
8006112 and dr cooks garden holds interest for several reasons it is about a subject that is more controversial today than when the play was written it has elements of the horror genre something the american century theater seldom gets to explore and the play never really had a chance on broadway it was miscast i think and the director george c scott essentially abandoned the production at a critical point most of all we think our audiences will enjoy it
8006113 i think the play may have been a trial run for deathtrap
8006114 there are a lot of structural similarities but its a darker scarier play
8006115 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche
8006116 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time
8006117 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
8006118 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
8006119 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
8006120 in a capitalist economy money calls the shots thats why its vital that the federal government provide substantial incentives and penalties to get renewable energy industries off the ground
8006121 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche
8006122 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time

8006126 one of the research efforts that we are going to undertake is to see how we make saudi arabia a center for solar energy research over the next 30 to 50 years
8006127 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche

8006132 today with prices for oil and gasoline at all time highs interest in the production of electricity at lower costs using energy other than fossil fuels is strong
8006133 good for you megan you broke up with him ya kicked him to the curb etc etc
8006134 we would have like to run the trois rivieres event but given the time frame thursday through sunday with the sunday race a 3 00 p
8006135 we missed the earlier races in vernon and edmonton for similar reasons along with the associated costs its a tough schedule and the costs are certainly a factor when you consider the travel time
8006136 we dont plan any changes in strategy for this race well just go out run as hard as we can and see what develops
8006137 high fuel prices mean the economics of operating a medium truck are under assault
8006138 every aspect of tire performance from low rolling resistance for greater fuel economy to increased durability and protection from road hazards to extended tread life and reliable casing performance for retreading can contribute to reduced costs these new tires are designed to help todays operator improve operating expenses at every level
8006139 a longer life for the casing ultimately means fewer resources are required to create new ones
8006140 each tire represents a measurable improvement in performance and cost efficiency over the model it replaces
8006141 saving fuel reducing emissions extending tire life and ultimately reducing operating costs have become paramount concerns for all operators yokohama shares those concerns and these tires help us support operators everywhere
8006142 the first three drivers were trying to pass the depailler turn simultaneously so i slowed down a little to gain some room so that i could take the turn as fast as possible and surprise them at the ryan turns braking
8006143 obviously it was also disappointing for our team on the one hand i knew after the crash that i was not leading the championship anymore and on the other hand the car was such a wreck that getting back on the raceway the next morning seemed impossible to everyone but to our crew chief yves b dard recalls raymond
8006144 its an exciting time to join ford of canada as we accelerate plans to introduce new fuel efficient vehicles especially small cars and crossovers which are exactly what canadian consumers are asking for
8006145 i look forward to working closely with the ford of canada dealers to ensure we are not only meeting but exceeding customer expectations as we introduce the new products
8006146 david is the right person to lead ford of canada as we launch our new model year fords 2009 product lineup is the best weve ever produced and david has a proven track record of connecting with customers energizing employees and partnering with our dealers to help drive sales

8006157 im not going to make the excuse of changes that was a full strength team if i cant make changes in the squad i have then those players shouldnt be at the football club
8006158 the league is our bread and butter but its disappointing thats the only word i can use good luck to hartlepool they fought for everything and they raised their game which happens when a premier league team comes to visit they probably deserved the win
8006159 were absolutely delighted and i think overall we deserved the victory even though they hit the woodwork three times
8006160 i like the way we got some rhythm and fluency to our play
8006161 the two centre forwards bullied our defenders from start to finish
8006162 crumbs of comfort are what we are after at the moment
8006163 this is going to be a war and when its over not everybody is going to be left standing therere no free rides on this deal
8006164 grace you know for someone who has a gay porn collection that requires its own storage facility you seem pretty upset about one kiss
8006165 a man renting a storage unit near love field in dallas found an unpleasant surprise locked inside this week a large stash of pornography police said
8006166 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action the united states should call for a meeting of the united nations security council to condemn russias decision in coordination with our european allies the u s should lead within the un and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions the osce must also send a serious monitoring group to georgia

8006169 we are proud to sponsor a program that introduces expectations and possibilities into the lives of these young people and gives them a guiding hand to help them reach their full potential
8006170 we are proud to report our ability to reduce delinquent behaviors in teens
8006171 while delinquency is decreased the new pathways program also increases goal oriented behaviors the skills we teach and the opportunity to practice those behaviors sets teens on a path to future success
8006172 as a business owner myself i looked for a way to reduce employee time away from work and increase after lunch productivity the best way i found is to provide your team with a healthy lunch so they dont have to leave
8006173 a good meal makes everyone happier and the healthy ingredients keep you from crashing two hours after lunch
8006174 the company chef delivers lunches that impress clients make employees healthier and happier reduce gasoline usage and improve productivity
8006175 people should pick chocolate the same way they buy wine and food by flavor
8006176 eventually i started fashioning my own equipment and began churning out some fine quality chocolate
8006177 it is extremely hard work and takes a lot of time but boy is it beautiful when you get right
8006178 chocolate is an affordable indulgence no matter how difficult economic times get well always want to treat ourselves
8006179 now you can go to kansas city and find a good chocolate maker who rivals the quality and craftsmanship of that you would find in europe
8006180 people love chocolate especially in hard times when they want to be comforted
8006181 there has been no windfall many of the retail arms of power companies have struggled to make money and have held down their prices to customers while wholesale prices have soared
8006182 i have no problem with companies making profits these are excessive profits immoral profits it isnt good enough and weve got to take action
8006183 last year we made just a whisker under 500 million in the uk that doesnt buy even one new power station it is our plan to spend more money than we earn in the uk for the next ten years that is a big commitment and if there was a windfall tax that is the sort of commitment that would have to be re evaluated
8006184 putting a tax on the electricity companies means they would lose money at a time when we need to spend 100billion on replacing old power stations over the next 11 years every pound taken from the companies would have to be raised by them elsewhere in the credit crisis that is difficult enough but a raid on electricity companies bank accounts would send out a very unfortunate signal to the world of investment
8006185 we are currently working with government on solutions to help them reach their 2010 targets on fuel poverty
8006186 the signal we are getting from government is that they are not minded to impose a windfall tax per se of the sort that was brought in after the 1997 election
8006187 however they could yet impose a mini windfall tax for example by making a retrospective charge on carbon emission permits that were given free to energy companies or by choosing to auction the remaining 3 per cent of carbon permits that they are allowed to release under european commission rules
8006188 gas and electricity was eating up more than 10 per cent of our income and weve got no choice other than to be a lot more careful than we have been in the past
8006189 i have to say i do get a bit frustrated when i see the big profits announcements made by the energy companies
8006190 they seem to be making more and more money yet they dont seem to be doing that much at all to help consumers get the best deal scottish power didnt tell me about how i could save money by going on a capped product or by going online
8006191 the reason we trim it every two years is to lighten it up
8006192 its got a 70 foot wide canopy it keeps getting a little growth and we keep thinning it out
8006193 we thin it out so that when the santa ana winds come the wind can blow through the tree without putting too much strain on the branches
8006194 it is impressive because its so massive birds going from one branch to another actually have to take flight
8006195 hugo ch vez no parece una mala persona pero parece loco
8006196 get back up what are you waiting for this time
8006197 we should start doing something now to save water or we could be in a serious situation three years from now

8006213 thats when it dawned on me that emilie really is an example to entrepreneurs
8006214 first off you have to be trained in your profession but what sets successful entrepreneurs apart is how they think
8006215 when its your business everything falls on your shoulders if youre not mentally equipped to handle that it spells business disaster
8006216 were known as the bookkeepers advocate in that everything we do is dedicated to making our members professional lives better but our support goes beyond providing the basics of being a better bookkeeper we help our members become better business people we help them make that mental shift thats so crucial to entrepreneurial success
8006217 within just a couple weeks he had his first group of clients and has never looked back
8006218 im excited to see him succeed as it points the way for future immigrants we like to think of our level of support as akin to having your own olympic coach
8006219 we knew the tempe marketplace water features would include a very popular childrens splash pad but we also added drama with waterfalls backlit by fire elements and color changing lighting overall the water features add to the inviting and upscale feel of this community marketplace and invite relaxation
8006220 i have so much fun using the splash pad as a backdrop for my childrens pictures
8006221 overall the soft economic environment continues to adversely affect the business particularly with respect to certain high ticket discretionary items and home related categories while a number of our product categories performed well such as kids crafts jewelry amp bead making and bakeware sales declines in home related categories including floral home d cor and custom framing businesses more than offset these increases on a comparable store basis
8006222 with the halloween fall and holiday seasons approaching our focus will be squarely on the customer our goal is to provide a compelling product assortment and excellent execution in our stores while conservatively managing our expense structure and inventory commitments we will however continue to invest time and resources towards our key strategic initiatives such as our consumer insight and category management programs in order to assure the long term growth and success of the michaels brand

8006231 we are very pleased with the progress made during the second quarter of 2008 towards commercial production as we signed a long term canola seed supply agreement with viterra canadas largest handler of grain and oilseeds contracted for and broke ground on the construction of the 44 000 square foot building in saskatoon and subsequent to the end of the second quarter signed a long term commercial sales agreement with shafer commodities inc to purchase all of the canola meal produced at our saskatoon facility
8006232 our team has put forth a tremendous effort to maintain our intended cost budgets and timelines while at the same time planning for all foreseeable contingencies
8006233 we respect that many companies in western canada have incurred cost and schedule overruns due to the high economic activity in that region but at present bioexx is pleased to report that it remains on plan and sees little risk of any significant delays or overruns

8006241 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
8006242 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised

8006244 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
8006245 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
8006246 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them
8006247 we finally get here arrive at the place it began and all i can think is what drew them all here so long ago what madness

8006269 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time
8006270 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
8006271 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
8006272 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
8006273 its about time the technology has been there for some time
8006274 its one of the technologies where price has come down and likely will continue to come down
8006275 conflict of interest could arise when an employer with a self funded benefit plan e g a self insured health plan also acts as the claims administrator for the plan
8006276 the supreme court held that such potential conflicts of interest could in certain circumstances result in less judicial deference to a claims administrators interpretation of a benefit claim if that claim is ever litigated

8006292 the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states
8006293 a unilateral act which is in fact left to the political discretion of states mostly to the executive branches
8006294 the freely expressed will of the ossetian and abkhaz peoples and being guided by the provisions of the un charter the 1970 declaration on the principles of international law governing friendly relations between states the csce helsinki final act of 1975 and other fundamental international instruments

8006296 let us remember just how despicable were salman rushdies crimes first he announced his apostasy from islam publically by releasing a written statement to the press
8006297 the angel d v prince of the kingdom of the persians resisted me and behold michael one of the chief princes came to help me and none is my helper in all these things but michael your prince
8006298 rushdie is therefore by his own admission guilty of both apostasy and blashphemy

8006306 amr said lets wait here until the cry has died down they are sure to hunt for us tonight and tomorrow i was still in the cave when uthman bin malik came riding proudly on his horse he reached the entrance to our cave and i said to my ansar companion if he sees us he will tell everyone in mecca so i went out and stabbed him with my dagger he gave a shout and the meccans came to him while i went back to my hiding place finding him at the point of death they said by allah we knew that amr came for no good purpose the death of their companion impeded their search for us for they carried him away
8006307 i went into a cave with my bow and arrows while i was in it a one eyed man from the banu bakr came in driving some sheep he said whos there i said lied im a banu bakr so am i then he laid down next to me and raised his voice in song i will not believe in the faith of the muslims i said you will soon see before long the bedouin went to sleep and started snoring so i killed him in the most dreadful way that anybody has ever killed i leant over him struck the end of my bow into his good eye and thrust it down until it came out the back of his neck after that i rushed out like a wild beast and took flight i came to the village of naqi and recognized two meccan spies i called for them to surrender they said no so i shot and arrow and killed one and then i tied the other up and took him to muhammad
8006308 i had tied my prisoners thumbs together with my bowstring the messenger of allah looked at him and laughed so that his back teeth could be seen then he questioned me and i told him what had happened well done he said and prayed for me to be blessed
8006309 hassan was with the women and children a jew passed by and began to walk around his settlement there was no one to protect them while the apostle and his companions were at the meccans throats so i said hassan this jew is walking around i fear he will point out our weakness while the muslims are too busy to attend to us so go down to him and kill him
8006310 allah forgive you daughter of abd al muttalib hassan said
8006311 the jews were made to come down and allahs messenger imprisoned them then the prophet went out into the marketplace of medina and he had trenches dug in it he sent for the jewish men and had them beheaded in those trenches they were brought out to him in batches they numbered 800 to 900 boys and men
8006312 the messenger commanded that furrows should be dug in the ground for the qurayza then he sat down ali and zubayr began cutting off their heads in his presence
8006313 the messenger of allah commanded that all of the jewish men and boys who had reached puberty should be beheaded then the prophet divided the wealth wives and children of the banu qurayza jews among the muslims
8006314 the punishment for those who wage war against allah and his prophet and make mischief in the land is to murder them crucify them or cut off a hand and foot on opposite sides their doom is dreadful they will not escape the fire suffering constantly
8006315 the prophet gave orders concerning kinanah to zubayr saying torture him until you root out and extract what he has so zubayr kindled a fire on kinanahs chest twirling it with his firestick until kinanah was near death then the messenger gave him to maslamah who beheaded him
8006316 the prophet said the hell fire is 69 times hotter than ordinary worldly fires
8006317 ali burnt some former muslims alive and this news reached ibn abbas who said had i been in his place i would not have burnt them as the prophet said
8006318 if the muslims had not been there we would have punished the unbelievers with a grievous torture
8006319 when the sacred forbidden months for fighting are past fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them take them captive torture them and lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem of war
8006320 the muslims met them with their swords they cut through many arms and skulls only confused cries and groans could be heard over our battle roars and snarling
8006321 the christian disbelievers will long to get out of the fire but never will they get out there from and theirs will be an enduring torture
8006322 the chief sheep tender sent out spies to obtain intelligence but they came back with their joints dislocated when he asked what had happened they said we saw white men on black horses before we could resist we were struck as you see us now
8006323 the apostle said get him away from me and cut off his tongue
8006324 umar said to the apostle let me pull out suhayls two front teeth
8006325 following badr muhammad sent a number of raiders with orders to capture some of the meccans and burn them alive
8006326 your lord inspired the angels with the message i will terrorize the unbelievers therefore smite them on their necks and every joint and incapacitate them strike off their heads and cut off each of their fingers and toes
8006327 when muhammad saw hamzah he said if allah gives me victory over the quraysh at any time i shall mutilate thirty of their men when the muslims saw the rage of the prophet they said by allah if we are victorious over them we shall mutilate them in a way which no arab has ever mutilated anybody
8006328 a raiding party led by zayd set out against umm in ramadan during it umm suffered a cruel death zyad tied her legs with rope and then tied her between two camels until they split her in two she was a very old woman then they brought umms daughter and abdallah to the messenger umms daughter belonged to salamah who had captured her muhammad asked salamah for her and salamah gave her to him
8006329 they ask you about the benefits of capturing the spoils of war
8006330 we ask thee for the booty of this town and its people forward in the name of allah he used to say this of every town he raided
8006331 the messenger of allah gave orders concerning the contents of the camp which the people had collected and it was all brought together among the muslims however there was a difference of opinion concerning it those who had collected it said it is ours muhammad promised every man that he could keep the booty he took those who were fighting said if it had not been for us you would not have taken it we distracted the enemy from you so that you could take what you took those who were guarding the prophet for fear the enemy would attack him said by allah you have no better right to it than we have we wanted to kill the enemy when allah gave us the opportunity and made them turn their backs and we wanted to take property when there was no one to protect it but we were afraid that the meccans might attack the prophet we protected him so you have no better right to it than we have when we quarreled about the booty we became very bad tempered so allah removed it from us and handed it over to his messenger
8006332 the total number of muslim fighters from mecca who fought at badr and were given a share of the booty were 81 when their shares were distributed their number was 101 but allah knows it better
8006333 the spoils of war surah came down from allah to his prophet concerning the distribution of the booty when the muslims showed their evil nature allah took it out of their hands and gave it to the apostle
8006334 allahs messenger came back to medina bringing with him the booty which had been taken from the polytheists there were forty four captives in the messenger of allahs possession there was a similar number of dead
8006335 the captives of khaybar were divided among the muslims then the messenger began taking the homes and property that were closest to him
8006336 so muhammad began seizing their herds and their property bit by bit he conquered home by home the messenger took some of its people captive including safiyah and her two cousins the prophet chose safiyah for himself
8006337 when dihyah protested wanting to keep safiyah for himself the apostle traded for safiyah by giving dihyah her two cousins the women of khaybar were distributed among the muslims
8006338 the prophet conquered khaybar by force after fighting khaybar was something that allah gave as booty to his messenger he took one fifth of it and divided the remainder among the muslims
8006339 i heard allahs apostle saying allah guarantees that he will admit the muslim fighter into paradise if he is killed otherwise he will return him to his home safely with rewards and booty
8006340 the banu sahm of aslam newly recruited muslim militants came to the messenger and complained muhammad we have been hurt by drought and possess nothing
8006341 allahs apostle besieged the final jewish community of khaybar until they could hold out no longer finally when they were certain that they would perish they asked muhammad to banish them and spare their lives which he did the prophet took possession of all their property
8006342 khaybar was divided among the people who had been at hudaybiyah
8006343 khaybar was apportioned among the men of hudaybiyah without regard to whether they were present at khaybar or not the spoil was divided into 1 800 shares
8006344 when the spoil of khaybar was apportioned the settlements of shaqq and nata were given to the muslims while katiba was divided into five sections allahs fifth which muhammad was custodian the prophets fifth the share to the kindred muhammads kin maintenance of the prophets wives now theres an honest report and payment to the men who acted as intermediaries in the peace negotiation with fadak which enabled the prophet to steal the entire spoil
8006345 then the apostle distributed the booty between his relatives his wives and to other men and women he gave his daughter fatima 200 shares ali 100 usama 250 aisha 200 bakr 100 in the name of allah this is a memorandum of what muhammad the apostle gave his wives from the dates and wheat 180 loads
8006346 allahs apostle divided the war booty with the ratio of two shares for the horse and one share for the foot soldier
8006347 when we conquered we gained neither gold nor silver as booty but we gained cows camels goods and gardens
8006348 when cities were conquered muslims used to say conquer for yourselves whatever seems good to you because all treasures were given to muhammad
8006349 he rewarded them with abundant spoils that they will capture allah has promised you much booty that you shall take and he has made this easy for you
8006350 take alms out of their property in order to cleanse and purify them and invoke allah for them surely this is a relief for them
8006351 since the hawazin and thaqif had marched with their women children and flocks allah granted them as booty to his messenger who divided the spoils among those quraysh who had recently embraced islam
8006352 abu talhah alone took the spoils of twenty men whom he had killed
8006353 i went up to a man and struck off his hand
8006354 to allahs lions who fight for his religion go the spoils that come from their prey return the booty to the man who killed him the apostle confirmed abu bakrs words so i was given the property of the man whom i had killed i sold it and bought a small palm grove with the money it was the first property i ever owned
8006355 the apostle held a large number of captives there were 6 000 women and children prisoners he had captured so many sheep and camels they could not be counted
8006356 muhammad divide the spoil and booty of camels and cattle among us they forced the prophet up against a tree and his robe was torn from him muhammad cried give me back my robe if there had been more sheep i would have given you some you have not found me to be niggardly cowardly or false
8006357 you have not found me miserly cowardly or a liar
8006358 the apostle gave gifts to those whose hearts were to be won over notably the chiefs of the army to win them and through them the people
8006359 allahs apostle got property and war prisoners and gave them to some people to the exclusion of others
8006360 the prophet said i give to the quraysh so that they will desire islam for they are nearer to their life of ignorance and it is not strong in their hearts
8006361 prophet this group of ansar have a grudge against you for what you did with the booty and how you divided it among you own people ansar what is this talk i hear from you what is the grudge you harbor against me do you think ill of me did i not come to you when you were erring and needy and then made rich by allah
8006362 do you hold a grudge against me and are you mentally disturbed because of the worldly things by which i conciliate a people and win them over so that they will embrace islam and become muslims
8006363 in this year the messenger sent amr to collect the zakat tax from jayfar and amr the clans of julanda and azd he collected the jizyah from the zoroastrians
8006364 indeed allah has guided you with his guidance if you wish to do well capture booty obey allah and his messenger you must perform the prayers pay the zakat tax and give a fifth share of allahs booty to his messenger the required zakat is from the land one tenth of that watered by springs and rain and one twentieth of that watered by the leathern bucket from camels a milch camel for every forty camels and a young male camel for every thirty camels from sheep one for every five camels and from cows one from every fourth if anyone pays more it is to his credit he who professes this bears witness to his islam and helps the faithful fight against the polytheists he has the protection of allah and his messenger
8006365 he who holds fast to his religion judaism or christianity is not to be tempted from it it is incumbent on them to pay the jizyah protection tax for every adult male or female free or slave one full denarius or its value in fine cloth he who pays that to the messenger has the protection of allah and his messenger and he who holds back from it is the enemy of allah and his messenger
8006366 the messenger has sent zurah and his companions to you i commend them to your care collect the zakat and jizyah from your districts and hand the money over to my messengers the prophet is the master of your rich and your poor
8006367 the muslims stole our goods and divided them their spears pierced us not once but twice their squadrons came at us like a swarm of locusts were it not for the religion of muhammads people their cavalry would never have attacked us
8006368 what allah gave as booty to his messenger he has taken away from them the jews for this you made no raid allah gives his messenger lordship over whomsoever he wills whatever booty allah has given to his messenger and taken away from the jewish people of the townships belongs to allah and to his messenger so take what the messenger assigns to you and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you
8006369 in this year muhammad ordered people to pay the zakat tax it is said that the prophet commanded them to do this
8006370 bind abu aziz tight for his mother is rich and she may ransom him for a great deal of money
8006371 among the captives was abu wada muhammad said he has a son who is a shrewd merchant with much money
8006372 slipped away at night went to medina ransomed his father for 4 000 dirhams
8006373 the prophet said abbas you must ransom yourself your two nephews aqil and nawfal and your confederate utbah for you are a wealthy man
8006374 the muslims told abu sufyan to pay them a ransom to free his son amr
8006375 the badr warriors were given five thousand dirhams each yearly
8006376 when the events of badr were over allah revealed the 8th surah the spoils of war in its entirety
8006377 what do you think khattab muhammad asked i say you should hand them over to me so that i can cut off their heads thus allah will know that there is no leniency in our hearts toward the unbelievers the messenger liked what bakr said and did not like what i said and accepted ransoms for the captives
8006378 on the badr expedition the messenger took the sword of dhu al faqar as booty it had belonged to munabbih on that day he also took abu jahls camel as booty it was a mahri dromedary on which he used to go on raids it is said that he wrote maaqil blood money on his sword
8006379 they question you about windfalls taken as spoils of war
8006380 the spoils of war surah was handed down because we quarreled about the booty so allah took it away from us and gave it to his apostle when he did we learned to fear allah and obey his messenger for in truth our army had gone out with the prophet seeking the caravan because we wanted its booty
8006381 allah taught them how to divide the spoil he made it lawful and said a fifth of the booty belongs to the apostle
8006382 if people are obstinate and refuse to surrender know that allah is your supporter and know that one fifth of all the booty you take belongs to allah and to the messenger and for the near relatives of the messenger
8006383 had it not been for a previous agreement from allah a severe penalty would have reached you for the ransom that you took as booty
8006384 so enjoy what you took as booty the spoils are lawful and good
8006385 allah made booty lawful and good he used it to incite the muslims to unity of purpose so enjoy what you have captured
8006386 by allah we saw the meccan women running revealing their leg bangles
8006387 the messenger divided the wealth wives and children of the banu qurayza jews among the muslims
8006388 when their wrists were bound with cords the apostle was a sea of generosity to us allahs messenger took his fifth of the booty he made known on that day the extra shares for horses and their riders giving the horse two shares and the rider one a muslim without a horse got one share of the spoil it was the first booty in which lots were cast
8006389 then the messenger of allah sent sad bin zayd with some of the qurayza captives to najd and in exchange for them he purchased horses and arms
8006390 allah saw what was in their hearts what they coveted so he rewarded them with victory and with as much spoil as they could take allah promised that they would soon capture a great deal of booty
8006391 abu jandal suhayls son escaped and joined abu basir nearly seventy muslim men gathered around them and they harassed the quraysh whenever they heard of a meccan caravan setting out for syria they intercepted it and killed everyone they could get a hold of they tore every caravan to pieces and took the goods
8006392 according to waqidi in this month the messenger sent out ukkashah with forty men to raid ghamr he traveled quickly but the enemy became aware and fled he sent out scouts and they captured a spy who guided them to some of their cattle they took two hundred head back to medina
8006393 the muslims were concerned they did not want to give up their share so muhammad said he who holds a share of these captives shall get six camels for every slave from the next booty we take so the muslims returned the women and children captives
8006394 believers when you go abroad to fight wars in allahs cause investigate carefully and say not to anyone who greets you you are not a believer coveting the chance profits of this life so that you may despoil him with allah are plenteous spoils and booty
8006395 allahs apostle said i have been ordered to fight the people till they say
8006396 if you apprehend treachery from any group on the part of a people with whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking off relations with them the infidels should not think they can bypass islamic law or the punishment of allah surely they cannot escape
8006397 gabriel brought down the following verse to the messenger if you apprehend treachery from any people with whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking off relations when gabriel had finished delivering this verse the prophet said i fear the banu qaynuqa it was on the basis of this verse that muhammad advanced upon them
8006398 judayy went to abd allah ibn ubayy to ask for support he said i found him sitting among a number of his companions while the prophets crier was calling men to arms he said this is a clever trick of muhammads the messenger of allah besieged the nadir jews for fifteen days in the end they made peace with him on the condition that the prophet would not kill them and that their property and their coats of mail would be his
8006399 the messenger of allah besieged the nadir for fifteen days until he had reduced them to a state of utter exhaustion so that they would give him what he wanted the terms in which the prophet made peace with the jews were he would not shed their blood he would expel them from their lands and settlements providing for every three of them a camel and a water skin
8006400 the prophet fought them until he made peace with them on condition that they evacuated yathrib he expelled them to syria but allowed them to keep what their camels could carry except for their coats of mail and weapons
8006401 believers obey allah and obey the messenger do not falter become faint hearted or weak kneed crying for peace
8006402 allah is not bound by any contract or treaty with non muslims nor is his apostle
8006403 when the people of fadak heard what had happened they sent word to the messenger asking him to banish them and spare their lives saying they too would leave him their property when the people of khaybar surrendered on these conditions the survivors asked muhammad to employ them on their farms for a half share of whatever they produced they said we know more about farming seeing that you are terrorists and all so muhammad made peace with them for a half share provided that if we want to expel you we may he made a similar arrangement with fadak so khaybar became the prey of the muslims while fadak belonged exclusively to the messenger of allah becoming his personal property because the muslims had not attacked its people with cavalry
8006404 and an announcement from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the pilgrimage is that allah and his messenger dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans
8006405 if two parties among the believers fall into fighting make peace but if one becomes aggressive then fight against the one that transgresses until it complies
8006406 the messenger made peace with them on condition that the zoroastrians should be required to pay the jizyah tax so onerous its akin to economic suicide that one should not marry their women
8006407 how can there be a covenant between allah and his messenger and the disbelievers with whom you made a treaty near the sacred mosque
8006408 how can there be such a treaty seeing that they get an advantage the upper hand over you they do not pay you respect or honor you or the ties of kinship or covenant with good words from their mouths they entice you out negotiate you but their hearts are averse to you
8006409 if they violate their oaths and break treaties taunting you for your religion then fight these specimens of faithlessness
8006410 the prophet said i think you will see abu sufyan the leading meccan merchant come to strengthen the pact and extend the term
8006411 abu sufyan went to muhammad in medina to affirm the peace treaty but muhammad refused to speak to him
8006412 sufyan went to abu bakr and asked him to intercede but he refused
8006413 there is nothing that you can do to make peace with him
8006414 when abu sufyan reported back to the quraysh that muhammad had given him no reply they said woe to you
8006415 muhammad commanded the people to prepare for the foray raid incursion sortie attack or assault
8006416 allah had enabled muhammad to take the persons of the quraysh by force giving him power over them so they were his booty their lives were now his spoil
8006417 when the populace settled down muhammad went to the kaaba and compassed it seven times on his camel touching the black stone with a stick then he went inside the temple there he found a dove made of wood he broke it in his hands and threw it away
8006418 when the messenger reached tabuk the governor of aylah a seaport at the north end of the gulf of aqabah came to him made a treaty and agreed to pay the jizyah tax the people of jarba and adhruh also offered to pay him the tax
8006419 the byzantines encountered the messengers cavalry which was led by khalid ukaydir was seized and his brother hassan was killed muhammad spared his life and made peace with him on the condition that he pay the zakat tax
8006420 in this year the zakat was made obligatory and the messenger dispatched his agents to collect it
8006421 in peace you are wild asses rough and coarse and in war you are like women wearing corsets but i care not so long as my hand can grasp my trusty blade
8006422 but if the enemy inclines toward peace do you also incline to peace and trust in allah should they intend to deceive or cheat you verily allah suffices he strengthened you with his aid and with believers
8006423 if they ask you for peace on the basis of islam submission make peace on that basis be of one mind by his religion
8006424 the muslims and polytheists stayed in their positions for twenty nights with no fighting except for the shooting of arrows and the siege when the trial became great for the people the messenger sent for the leaders of the ghatafan meccan comrades he offered them a third of the date harvest of medina on condition that they leave the truce between the sides progressed to the point of drawing up a written document but there was no witnessing or firm determination to make peace it was only a matter of maneuvering
8006425 now that allah has conferred islam on us and made us famous shall we give them our property by allah we will offer them only the sword until allah judges between us as you wish said allahs messenger
8006426 abu sufyan said we were merchants but the fighting between us and muhammad has prevented us from journeying so our wealth is depleted
8006427 for those who join a group between you and whom there is a treaty or those who become weary of fighting you had allah had willed he could have given them power over you and they would have fought you therefore if they withdraw and wage not war and send you guarantees of peace then allah has not given you a way to war against them
8006428 you will find others who while wishing to live in peace and being safe from you to gain the confidence of their people thrown back to mischief headlong therefore if they do not withdraw from you and offer you peace besides restraining their hands then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and against these we have given you a clear sanction and authority
8006429 the desert arabs who lagged behind in fighting will say to you muhammad we were engaged in looking after our flocks and our families we have prepared for them a blazing fire
8006430 there is no blame for the blind nor is it a sin for the lame nor on one ill if he joins not in the fighting but he who retreats allah will punish him with a painful doom
8006431 have you not seen those to whom it was said withhold your hands from fighting perform the prayer and pay the zakat
8006432 wherever you are death will find you even if you are in towers built up strong and high if some good befalls they say this is from allah but if evil they say this is from you muhammad say all things are from allah so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand these simple words
8006433 what is the matter with you that you are divided about the hypocrites allah has cast them back causing their disbelief would you guide those whom allah has thrown out of the way for those whom allah has thrown aside and led astray never shall they find the way
8006434 they wish that you would reject faith as they have and thus be on the same footing do not be friends with them until they leave their homes in allahs cause but and this is a hell of a but if they turn back from islam becoming renegades seize them and kill them wherever you find them
8006435 those who believe say how is it that no surah was sent down for us but when a categorical decisive or uncompromising surah is revealed and fighting and war jihad holy fighting in allahs cause are ordained you will see those with diseased hearts looking at you muhammad fainting unto death therefore woe unto them
8006436 were they to obey showing their obedience in modest speech after the matter of preparation for jihad had been determined for them it would have been better is it to be expected that if you were put in authority and given command that you would do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship such men are cursed by allah he has made them deaf dumb and blind
8006437 verily when angels take the souls of those who die wronging themselves by staying home they say in what plight or engagement were you they reply weak on the earth such men will find their abode in hell an evil resort
8006438 except those who are feeble men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor have the means or power these are those whom allah is likely to forgive
8006439 do you think you will get away before allah knows who among you have striven hard and fought
8006440 believers what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of allah i e jihad you cling to the earth do you prefer the life of this world to the hereafter unless you march he will afflict and punish you with a painful torture and put others in your place but you cannot harm him in the least
8006441 may allah forgive you muhammad why did you grant them leave for remaining behind you should have persisted as regards to your order to them to proceed on jihad until you had known the liars
8006442 those who believe in allah and the last day do not ask for an exemption from fighting with your goods and persons and allah knows well those who do their duty
8006443 only those ask for exemption from jihad who believe not in allah and whose hearts are in doubt so that they are tossed to and fro if they had intended to march out to fight they would certainly have made some preparation and readied their equipment but allah was averse to their being sent forth so he made them lag behind sit you among those who sit if they had marched with you they would not have added to your strength but only made for discord spying and sowing sedition there would have been some in your midst who would have listened to them but allah knows well those peace loving muslims who do wrong and are wicked
8006444 they had plotted sedition before and upset matters for you until the decree of allah to fight became manifest much to their disgust among them are many who say grant me exemption to stay back at home exempted from jihad and do not tempt me with promises of booty have they not fallen into temptation already indeed hell surrounds them
8006445 the hypocrites enjoin what is forbidden and forbid what islam commands they withhold their hands from spending in allahs cause jihad they have forgotten allah so he has forgotten them verily the hypocrites are oblivious rebellious and perverse
8006446 allah has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers the fire of hell for their abode therein shall they dwell it will suffice them on them is the curse of allah and an enduring punishment a lasting torment
8006447 the hypocrites swear by allah that they said nothing but indeed they uttered blasphemy and they disbelieved after surrender accepting islam they meditated a plot to murder prophet muhammad which they were unable to carry out the reason for this revenge of theirs was the bounty of booty with which allah and his messenger had enriched them if they repent it will be best for them but if they turn back allah will punish them with a grievous torment in this life and in the hereafter
8006448 some of you made a deal with allah saying if you give us booty we shall pay you the tax but when he gave them booty they became greedy and refused to pay as a consequence of breaking their promises allah filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last forever
8006449 he punished them by putting hypocrisy in their hearts until the day whereon they shall meet him because they lied to allah and failed to perform as promised allah knows their secrets those who slander and taunt the believers who pay the zakat for allahs cause voluntarily and throw ridicule on them scoffing allah will throw back their taunts and they shall have a painful doom whether you ask for their forgiveness or not their sin is unforgivable if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness allah will not forgive them
8006450 those who stayed behind rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the messenger they hated to strive and fight with their goods and lives in the cause of allah they said go not forth in the heat say the fire of hell is fiercer in heat if only they could understand so let them laugh a little for they will weep much as a reward for what they did if allah brings you back from the campaign to a party of the hypocrites and they ask to go out to fight say you shall never go out to fight with me against a foe you were content sitting inactive on the first occasion so sit with the useless men who lag behind do not pray for any of them muhammad that die nor stand at his grave they rejected allah and disbelieved his messenger they died in a state of perverse rebellion
8006451 and let not their wealth or following in sons dazzle you or excite your admiration allahs plan is to punish them with these things in this world and to make sure their souls perish while they are unbelievers when a surah comes down enjoining them to believe in allah and to strive hard and fight along with his messenger those with wealth and influence among them ask you for exemption from jihad they prefer to be with their women who remain behind at home their hearts are sealed and so they understand not
8006452 the messenger and those who believe him strive hard and fight jihad with their wealth and lives in allahs cause
8006453 and there were among the wandering desert arabs men who made excuses and came to claim exemption from the battle those who lied to allah and his messenger sat at home soon will a grievous torment seize them
8006454 the complaint is against those who claim exemption from fighting while they are rich they prefer to stay with the women who remain behind at home allah has sealed their hearts they are content to be useless say present no excuses we shall not believe you it is your actions that allah and his messenger will observe they will swear to you by allah when you return hoping that you might leave them alone so turn away from them for they are unclean an abomination and hell is their dwelling place a fitting recompense for them
8006455 the arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which allah hath sent down to his messenger some of the bedouins look upon their payments for allahs cause as a fine and wish disasters to fall on you so that they might not have to pay yet on them be the disaster of evil
8006456 among the desert arabs are hypocrites they like the people of medina are obstinate in hypocrisy we know them twice shall we punish them and in addition they shall be brought back to a horrible torment
8006457 it is not fitting for the people of medina and the bedouin arabs to refuse to follow allahs messenger muhammad when fighting in allahs cause nor to prefer their own lives to his life they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue in allahs cause no do they go without reward they do not take steps to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy without it being written to their credit as a deed of righteousness
8006458 muhammad turned to see umm a pregnant woman who said o messenger
8006459 one of the hypocrites feeling an aversion to battle being skeptical of the truth and spreading false rumors about muhammad said that they should not go out in the heat
8006460 jadd told muhammad will you allow me to stay behind and not tempt me
8006461 give me leave to stay behind and do not tempt me
8006462 one of the estranged ones said to another dont go out to fight in this heat
8006463 some bedouins came to apologize for not going into battle but allah would not accept their excuses
8006464 the surah of the hypocrites came down because some men sent secret messages to the nadir jews when the apostle besieged them
8006465 have you not considered the hypocrites who say to their brethren the people of the book jews we shall never obey anyone against you
8006466 have you not observed the hypocrites saying to their unbelieving brethren among the people of the book if you are expelled from your homes by the muslims we will go with you but allah is witness that they are liars if the jews are expelled never will the hypocrites go with them if they are attacked they will not help them defend themselves in truth you jihadist muslims are more fearful and awful than they because they are afraid of you this is a result of the terror sent by allah they are men devoid of understanding
8006467 they are a divided people devoid of sense there is a grievous punishment awaiting them satan tells them not to believe so both of them will end up in hell
8006468 o you who believe obey allah and his messenger do not turn away from him when you hear him speak do not be like those who say we hear but do not listen those who do not obey are the worst of beasts the vilest of animals in the sight of allah they are deaf and dumb those who do not understand are senseless if allah had seen any good in them he would have made them listen and even if he had made them listen they would but have turned away and declined submission
8006469 be not as those who came from their homes full of their own importance trying to turn men away from fighting in allahs cause
8006470 when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said the religion has deceived and misled them
8006471 verily the worst of creatures the vilest of beasts in the sight of allah are those who reject him and will not believe they are those with whom you make an agreement but they break their covenant every time and they keep not their duty to fight
8006472 o muslims why say one thing and do another grievously odious and hateful is it in the sight of allah that you say that which you do not truly allah loves those who fight in his cause in a battle array as if they were a solid cemented structure
8006473 when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you are indeed the messenger of allah allah knows you are his messenger and allah bears witness the hypocrites are indeed liars
8006474 they have made their oaths a screen thus they obstruct men from the path of allah truly evil are their deeds that is because they believed then they rejected faith so a seal was set on their hearts
8006475 when you look at the hypocrites their bodies please you and when they speak you listen to their words they are pieces of wood propped up they think every cry is against them they are the enemies so beware of them the curse of allah is on them allah will destroy them how are they deluded and perverted
8006476 it is equal to them whether you ask forgiveness or not allah will never forgive them allah does not forgive the transgressing people
8006477 the hypocrites are the ones who say spend nothing on those who are with allahs messenger so that they will desert him
8006478 thous shall not suffer a witch witch not eccentric old woman unpopular person oddball kook whatever to live
8006479 why does allah need men to kill for him on his behalf is he unable to act does he have no power could he just not send a lightening bolt to destroy the one who mocked him
8006480 the good lord would do if he knew the facts of the case
8006481 it is ok for you to fine and imprison those who deny the holocaust but not ok for muslims to do the same against scumbags like rushdie

8006581 the energy companies are able to protect and improve their profit margins with seeming impunity theres no real competitive pressure on them theres no company looking over their shoulder and that shouldnt be possible in a competitive market

8006583 price is king which reflects the current economic climate and the price rises that are being experienced by most customers concerned customers are taking steps to reduce their home energy bills such as turning out lights or turning down thermostats but probably the most worrying for energy companies is the desire of many customers to switch supplier over the next year due to price

8006766 weve always known from direct customer feedback and informal estimates that grid mp is a product that delivers deep financial benefits but its certainly gratifying to have this validated by a 3rd party analysis
8006767 univa ud is all about better performance for a better price clearly as this paper shows with grid mp our customers stand to enjoy huge gains in many areas beyond the obvious reductions in hardware costs
8006768 i was surprised at the number of areas in which this technology delivers economic benefits
8006769 i think most people make the assumption that grid technology simply replaces hardware so thats the main area where roi gets estimated but it actually goes way beyond that
8006770 in fact hardware purchase avoidance only represents 5 of the total first year savings for this company and is not factored in at all for the millions in savings after year one

8006772 in products from sunscreen to industrial coatings consumers are seeing the benefits of products built with materials measured in billionths of a meter nanotechnology offers vast promise and commercial opportunities opportunity however goes hand in hand with risk
8006773 nanotechnology adds an entirely new and largely unexplored realm of risks spread across the entire spectrum of modern commerce these emerging risks require a sophisticated approach by risk managers and businesses these risks carry with them the potential for far reaching effects on market cycles manufacturing and the safety security and well being of consumers the task of identifying these risks is complicated by the fact that scientists are still discovering how nanoparticles perform in manufactured products and how they react with humans and the environment
8006774 in addition corporate risk managers may not have recognized yet the role that nanotechnology is already playing or will be playing in their own businesses as nanotechnology plays a growing role in commerce insurers and underwriters will be increasingly taking these risks into account risk managers and insurers should strive to keep ahead of the issue of risk identification as nanotechnology makes its impact felt in the manufacturing legislative regulatory and legal arenas as well as in the realm of insurance underwriting

8006974 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants

8006977 let nuclear plant building happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried how much this will cost and who will pay

8006995 this compressor which is performing a gas gathering application is operating at 1 350 rpm with a compression ratio of 3 1 under harsh conditions
8006996 during this time several of the conventional valves have been changed out each of the swri valves has now accumulated more than 3 000 operating hours at full load and full speed to have our valves run in this compressor under these conditions without failure is quite an achievement we also added a capacity control feature to our design which means the valve can now be used to control flow making it an even more efficient choice

8007042 i dont dare to think about what might have happened if this ute had ripped into my place while they were playing
8007043 this is beyond a joke and weve all had enough
8007044 i was in bed and woke about 5am on saturday to hear a vehicles engine revving
8007045 then i heard its tyres squealing as the ute took off again its wheels squealing as if a madman was driving
8007046 when i came outside i saw this carnage in my backyard
8007047 the ute must have been flying down the 60kph road at about 100kph when it fish tailed and the driver lost control
8007048 after sheering through my neighbours fence it struck the side of my falcon damaging it so badly that it is a write off

8007058 it is increasingly difficult for independent councillors to run particularly with new department of local government legislation and the cost candidates have got to be mindful of so many things so people probably put it in the too hard basket
8007059 you could look at it that the majority of people are satisfied with the work the council is doing
8007060 if were going to pre empt the result i think well get a conservative majority
8007061 i am the only independent candidate in north ward and i would like to think thats because im doing a good job
8007062 ive always had a problem approaching girls they would just walk past me like i didnt exist i sometimes felt like they purposely would not give me any attention just because they were snobby and stuck up now when i use ultra allure pheromones its alot easier to approach girls because they are usually the ones that will smile at me first or make eye contact
8007063 i saw you guys offered a moneyback guarantee so i though i would give it a go i had nothing to lose well how glad am i that i did my first night out with a little ultra allure on me i had 4 different girls ask me what i was wearing and what i was doing later i met up with the hottest of the 4 now i dont even leave the house without throwing on a few dabs of ultra allure its my not so secret weapon i can honestly say this product truly works women are really drawn to you once they catch a little bit of the scent

8007067 i just want you to know that this is a great honor this is a great honor being nominated the vice president of the united states and i am proud of it i dont mean in any way to diminish it but it pales in comparison to the honor that ive had representing you
8007068 but i tell you what i look at every stage in my life you know my private life has been lived under not because anybody everybody has been good to me but my private life has been lived in a public arena because you all got me started so young really i mean as early as you know when i was i had been out of law school what a year before i got involved in a way with the democratic party which was kind of on its heels back then remember we had a bad run back in the late sixties early seventies
8007069 the essence of this tragedy it seems to me derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers an inability to imagine or connect with the humanity and suffering of others

8007110 they were paid to do that to give instruction during the week so students picked up or filled in the gaps if they missed it during the regular school week
8007111 were trying to control what goes in there feels right and has a good way to jump start what happens downtown and with the economy develops
8007112 its ambitious with the amount of time that has been consumed
8007113 but my sincere hope is to have the drillers in the stadium in the spring of 2010
8007114 we would anticipate steel orders and other major components to immediately follow the council approval
8007115 thats the same malarkey they sold us back when it was an emergency to pass the ball park idea to begin with and then took ten weeks on negotiating a deal
8007116 i personally believe construction costs are going down i believe the cost of oil is going down and for them to say that the absolute cost of construction will go up in the short term strikes me as a bogus prediction
8007117 its either do it correct now or come back in ten years when there is a lawsuit because of loose language of the trust and then try and get it right
8007118 the guys here at south memorial are going to bathe them up socialize them and get them ready for adoption

8007120 well they are really well behaved from what we see typically and the schnauzers seem very docile and very amicable in general
8007121 the city has to adopt that code that mandates food handlers or food handler classes
8007122 once the city mandates that we offer food handler courses
8007123 well its game week the season is upon us were excited its finally here you get to the beginning of training camp at camp pendleton and you think this day will never come its just seems so far off when you begin training camp now that its here you look back and its like a blur but it was the best training camp weve had so far and our best off season i feel so much better going into this year than i did in year one our guys have worked extremely hard what remains to be seen is how our guys do we have a lot of new faces in there weve seen them in practice of course but we havent seen them in games yet but we feel good about where theyre at and they need that game experience
8007124 one of our team goals is to get off to a good start we havent had a good start in the non conference since weve been here we were 0 4 in the first year and 1 3 last year so getting off to a good start has been a big emphasis were anxious to play its finally here were tired of playing against each other like any team
8007125 were excited about our team we have good youth and talent on our football team its a team thats going to be together for a couple of years and not just this year well have everybody coming back next year
8007126 i think thats the key to any turn around program if you study turnarounds in the past 20 years or so and i ve been with a few of them they did a big part of it through scheduling for example we had three bcs teams last year and this year we have one we still have to go earn it theyre not gimmes by any stretch of the imagination you have to go out and earn it cal poly is a team that came in here and beat us a couple of years ago so its on an earned basis no one is ever going to roll over for you but at least it gives us a chance going in it gives a chance to get footing in this program and get off to a good start like i mentioned before when youre 0 4 or 1 3 coming out of non conference youre behind the 8 ball already then you have a conference schedule to play and its tough you try to get to that magical seventh victory sometimes a sixth one will get you into a bowl but you can really pad it by getting that seventh one thats where non conference scheduling comes in in studying the mountain west in the last 10 years i dont believe anybody that started with an 0 4 or 1 3 record went to a bowl maybe theres one but youd have to look it up they were at least 2 2 or 3 1 going into the conference
8007127 it was one of the first priorities if not the first
8007128 it does every loss does it was a tight game i remember fumbling at the end we had a turnover at the end of the game that gave them good field position to kick the field goal to go ahead we still had a chance with two minutes left to go down and win we drove all the way down and missed a field goal but we didnt execute like we should have it was a tough game
8007129 when ryan was a freshman he was the most mature young quarterback ive ever seen he has the chance to be a four year starter which would be the first for me in coaching the most i ever had was a two year starter its exciting for him to have a chance to do that he needs to perform like everybody and earn his way through games we have a capable man in drew westling behind him so ryan knows that theres competition and he needs to perform to stay on the field but i really like what he has been doing all camp he has really separated himself if you didnt know our roster you would go to our practices and confuse him at times with being a senior thats a good feeling to have
8007130 i like what we have up front peter nelson came out of spring as a defensive tackle now hes our starting left tackle we made the switch thinking hes better suited for offense and so did he behind him is brian milholland who is a good true freshman to keep an eye on he has all the tools that you want at that position he has the feet the speed and the size hes maybe our biggest guy on the football team right now trask iosefa was our starting center last year and we see him growing as well this year ikaika aken moleta is a young man at right guard who is turning out to be a good story we think he will be by the end of the year when he first got here we didnt think he was going to make it he was overweight he wasnt in shape he was one of the last guys to finish the sprints and conditioning but he has dropped weight and worked hard in school and on the football field now that the smoke has cleared hes our starting right guard and doing well then theres lance louis you know his story he was a tight end hurt his knee and lost some speed but hes gifted he s got great strength good feet and hes got a chance to be a good right tackle for us by the end of the year we moved him from guard to tackle because we needed that done but we have the makings of a good offensive line
8007131 we have them in different one and two back packages in our system each one of them brings a little different nuance to the table and we want to be able to use those it will sift down to probably two or maybe three at the most as time goes on but we have some good packages put together right now with each one bringing a strength to the table its been one of the most competitive battles in camp and we like what theyre all doing
8007132 last year starting out with two pac 10 opponents is obviously a little different than how we are starting the season this year this is a situation we are really excited about we feel that cal poly is a great game for us to go out and avenge a loss from two years ago as well as to get us off on the right foot that is something that we are really excited about and getting ready for this first game has been our focus all along
8007133 i think that it will help us to get rolling a little bit before we hit conference cal poly is obviously a good team they are ranked no 14 in the nation in division i aa and they have the no 1 returning offense at that level they are a good solid team so it will be a fun challenge
8007134 it definitely has been the best camp by far we had the best summer which led into a great camp because we were able to hit the ground running going into day one of camp we were already in shape and understood what we needed to do defensively as well as offensively we were ahead of the game when camp started and that helped us to take it to a whole new level now going into the first game week
8007135 it was tough that is a game that we will always remember and that we were not happy with now we are lucky enough to have an opportunity to make it right and what better chance to do that than in our home opener we are excited about the game and the loss is definitely something we will remember when we are out there on saturday
8007136 when you face an opponent like cal poly the first thing you have to be aware of is always doing your assignment our main focus is to have everyone knowing their job and executing it on every single play the number one priority is to stop the run because they live and die by the run they throw the ball well but that is kind of a change up for them they will lull you to sleep with the run and then change it up and throw the ball off of that we feel that if they have to beat us throwing the ball then we got them where we want them
8007137 those guys have grown up a lot over the past couple years they are bigger stronger and more physical they have matured a lot in this defense and are starting to understand their role in every single play call that we have they are also very athletic all three of those guys are some of the most athletic linebackers that i have come across in my career they are fun to watch so it will be exciting to see them continue to grow as the season goes along
8007138 i dont think it has been a setback because we have the guys to fill in for those positions everyone will make plays and help us out also the injured guys will be back so we will be alright
8007139 it definitely hurts because he is a great player but we have great people right behind him to back him up they know the schemes and they know what to do so we will be just fine
8007140 we have some young guys but i think weve grown a lot over this camp period and these last couple weeks guys like darren mougey mike schmidt and lance louis have really helped in that they are huge leaders in the huddle
8007141 i think we are just going to go out and play hard im not really worried about trying to be the next kevin oconnell or be in his footsteps im just thinking of it from a team aspect we need to go out and win ball games that is all im really worried about right now
8007142 ive been working on my timing and getting cohesive with everyone else ive been able to get good timing with some of the other guys and get in a good rhythm with the offense
8007143 there are no guarantees in college football there are great teams across the board but these are games that we would like to win the schedule is favorable compared to how it has been in the past that is something we look forward to as a team and something we need to take advantage of i think we will do well with it
8007144 we just want to instill a sense of pride and the competitive nature of the game of football at the college level we want to show them how competitive it is and how it needs to be throughout the program and throughout the whole season
8007145 its a sad thing that an animal in this condition has to live in this environment
8007146 im being punished for taking in dogs that need help
8007147 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8007148 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8007149 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party
8007150 some time after i had first met him in sydney
8007151 he probably will not be available for the next two test matches
8007152 i dont know if its a new mindset or not
8007153 podzone will i hope be regular in the sense that rur is regular which likely means highly unpredictable as regards publishing schedule

8007157 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
8007158 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
8007159 because so few are thinking naturally there are found but a few to argue prejudice there is in abundance and sentiment too for these are things born of enthusiasm without the pain of labor thinking on the contrary is a difficult task it is the hardest work man can do that is perhaps why so few indulge in it thought saving devices have been invented that rival labor saving devices in their ingenuity fine sounding phrases like life is bigger than logic or progress is the spirit of the age go rattling by us like express trains carrying with them the burden of those who are too lazy to think for themselves not even philosophers argue today they only explain away at best both sides may shoot off firecrackers creating the illusion of conflict but it is only a sham battle in which there are no casualties there are plenty of explosions but never an exploded argument
8007160 unfortunately the continued success of our united way is threatened by an erosion of public confidence and trust resulting from the current controversy over compensation
8007161 we concluded we needed a fresh start and part of that fresh start is new leadership
8007162 the board is taking responsibility for mistakes the executive committee in particular is apologizing to the community

8007166 we take a great deal of pride in these games each is a meticulously detailed recreation of the historical battles they represent i truly believe that they are the most realistic simulations of modern combat commercially available we think wargamers will agree

8007176 oh man we have just had heaps of response its been much easier than i thought
8007177 people seem to be quite keen to come here so i am quite surprised
8007178 i have got a few bookings so things are looking good a fews better than none i tell myself so fingers crossed
8007179 i dont think today we have taken a step backwards in our preparations
8007180 perhaps we werent so precise but we had an opponent which was also playing and we had five or six chances with only the goalkeeper to beat
8007181 we lost but we could have drawn or even won
8007182 we are faced on one side with union demands which we have some sympathy with but on the other hand by funding from the ministry of health which is simply not going to meet those demands
8007183 we cannot consider a claim of this scale without a significant change in funding from the ministry

8007187 its only been two months and i think this is the easy part its going to be later down the track when its six to nine months when things will get tough
8007188 you know its easy for me to sit here now and say im clean and i havent done this and i havent done that but its not that easy i am happy with where im at the moment though
8007189 mr kalt cogently and eloquently expressed his views in support of the offer by victory nickel and we are in total agreement with his analysis
8007190 it is reassuring to have independent nickel shareholders publicly supporting our efforts and we thank mr kalt for coming forward although not in writing victory nickel has also received indications of support from other shareholders we encourage other shareholders to follow mr kalts lead and make their views known to independent nickels special committee of directors formed to consider the offer
8007191 like independent nickel victory nickel is an emerging nickel mining leader with both valuable assets and great people i strongly hold the opinion that victorys offer to acquire independent is a good offer for independent investors moreover i believe it delivers an opportunity rich outcome that is capable of large value creation for all stakeholders of the proposed entity
8007192 secu is constantly evaluating our products and services to stay current with member needs given todays economy fuel prices are playing a major role in the types of vehicles our members are choosing to purchase and finance there are a number of vehicles on the market that have high fuel economy but because a large percentage were not defined as hybrid or alternative fuel vehicles they did not fit within the original parameters of our green vehicle program it was obvious we needed to revise our program and give members a better loan option to purchase a fuel efficient vehicle secus program now allows even more members to save on loan costs and ultimately keep their money where it belongs in their pockets
8007193 everyone we have sent into this place even people who have worked for a lot of other interactive firms desperately want to work for these guys the environment and the work they do is unique interesting and challenging

8007231 every dhb would have formal controls over the management of controlled drugs such as opiates
8007232 i personally think dhbs have an obligation to support staff with addiction problems or dependence on chemicals
8007233 but of course if its a security issue and drugs are going missing and being sold for example then thats an entirely different disciplinary matter
8007234 to me if the drug was contained in an ampoule it would be difficult to dilute it and replace it at that point perhaps its when the drug is being used with the patient and transferred from the ampoule or vial over to an iv system it may be easier to dilute it at that point
8007235 i think dhbs in particular i think they should look at the potential for staff to use drugs for their own use if they have a potential problem and maybe refer them to their occupational health unit or the doctors health advisory service accordingly
8007236 i spent several years researching this book using an enormous body of documentation and im not about to denounce it just because it upsets a few people
8007237 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits

8007318 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
8007319 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
8007320 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
8007321 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
8007322 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
8007323 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

8007336 my desire to devote more time to my family and other interests runs counter to the obligations of a hedge fund manager who must be immersed in the markets in order to meet client expectations
8007337 our approach allows investors to obtain the very same benefits as they would with a hedge fund without the limitations usually associated with hedge funds
8007338 we use an investment philosophy similar to global tactical asset allocation that attempts to exploit short term market inefficiencies by taking positions in various markets with a view to profiting from relative movements across those markets
8007339 the approach focuses on general movements in the markets rather than on performance of individual securities within them positions are generally taken with a relatively short term time horizon of three to six months hence the term tactical asset allocation and in markets across the globe hence global

8007357 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
8007358 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
8007359 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
8007360 were determined to do what no other city has ever attempted and that is to keep our energy usage at or near its current level even as our population grows
8007361 new york city is going to make money by being green and thats the message we want to send to the private sector as well you can have it both ways
8007362 theres a lot of logistical as well as esthetic considerations off shore wind is much more likely if there is a large ape that starts climbing the empire state building it might get in his way
8007363 some want a cap and trade system which is like taking three right turns instead of one left
8007364 theyll also require cost effective retrofits of our existing larger buildings
8007365 if theres one overriding reaction it was the less intensity he brings to a song the better it sounds even cutting him a break for this album being made up of well early works he indulges in some of the most overwrought heavily mannered pseudo soul singing ive heard since joe cockers heyday something that the tight format of idol probably didnt allow him to practice to excess the bulk of the album is made up of either dull by the numbers blue eyed soul including sadly two cuts later recut for his major label album the deal and soul thing they are not diamonds in the rough here or the aforementioned excursions into tortured oversinging a cover of ray charles version of georgia on my mind two highly cocker esque tracks called heart and soul and in your time yet on a few tracks he breaks the mold notably a pair of folky numbers the fall and west texas sky that i would recommend you check out especially the former skip however the ultra loose cover of archie bell amp the drells tighten up which the album booklet not only gives him credit for writing but which he seems to date unless i misheard him as coming from 1973 when it was a hit in 1968 so a disappointing collection from someone whos still one of my favorite idol contestants lets hope the new album displays a little more restraint and variety
8007366 well we bursted out of class had to get away from those fools we learned more from a 3 minute record baby than we ever learned in school tonight i hear the neighborhood drummer sound i can feel my heart begin to pound you say youre tired and you just want to close your eyes and follow your dreams down
8007367 short staffing leads to nurses and caregivers becoming overworked stressed and unable to deliver the kind of care they know their residents deserve
8007368 from what i understand they might be running a little bit of a two quarterback system until things settle down anyway
8007369 they are a team that has had tremendous success over the years appalachian state only lost one game last year and that was to georgia southern so that gets my attention we have a high level of respect for georgia southern most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry i know we have some players who played high school ball with these guys so there is a lot of pride in this game we are looking forward to getting it started
8007370 when we got into camp i thought we started out with the normal energy excitement and enthusiasm then we just hit an injury bug a little bit more than we are used to having a couple of kids are already lost for the season since camp started in charles white others are going to lose some significant playing time in brannan southerland the camp was a little different than others in that it was frustrating for us to not have the players there to practice we couldnt evaluate the young guys as much as we would like to weve been juggling more in this camp than we did all last year put together on the offensive line one thing that has concerned me about this camp is the lack of warm weather its been cool like today there isnt much heat and much humidity even this saturday if it gets sunny and 92 degrees like they say it might it could be tough on our guys i hope we have enough depth to withstand it
8007371 knowshon had a spell where he couldnt get any reps and i guess he fell by the wayside
8007372 knowshon will of course get the majority of carries richard samuel and caleb king will both get reps i hope dontavius jackson and carlton thomas both get reps too im not discounting them from getting a carry here and there all those tailbacks are still in the running to play as true freshmen richard and caleb are the frontrunner for the next reps i cant say who will be the first one to get the carry they will be the two who get the majority of reps after knowshon
8007373 our defense has a chance to be pretty good we have a lot of returning players and starters they are guys who know what they are doing and guys who know what it takes to play the georgia way im confident that they will get after it pretty good i wouldnt necessarily say this is the fastest defense weve had im not saying its not its hard to gauge i think we looked faster than usual last year because i know we played more guys than usual the more guys you play the fresher they are and the faster they look
8007374 is it a good thing its good if we stay there and if we are there at the end its been good as far as a lot of positive publicity for our football team has it helped me motivate i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys it is an exciting factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program they know it will be up for judgment every week so i guess it was fun while it lasted
8007375 we were very concerned to start three freshmen last year that is a concern to have three freshman linemen start in the sec we did have some stability we had an anchor in fernando velasco chester adams did a good job too fernando was the leader of that group now the leadership we had last year is gone we were thinking there would be three returning starters but with an injury and a suspension we have one returning starter chris davis played guard and now hes our center everyone else is a first time starter
8007376 i think he is just like anybody hes going to get more and more comfortable with repetition obviously the season hasnt started but from what we are putting in and the things i see him doing i like it were pretty good at talking about what we think will work against a team and putting something together its been good
8007377 i just want to see us come out there and play with excitement
8007378 i really dont want to speak on whether its better or worse but i know that as far as experience wise im a year more experienced chris davis is a year more experienced clint boling is a year more experienced kiante tripp and josh davis got a few reps last year too we have two good years underneath our belts working with coach stacy searels and all of his techniques i think we did okay in the scrimmages that weve had and i think well do fine in my opinion as long as we stay health and do what coach searels says well do fine
8007379 his talent is unmatched when you get a chance to spend time with him his personality the energy that he brings to the game and the way he gets the fans involved people actually feel apart of knowshon moreno his teammates rally behind him hes just a guy that you just cant help but love and pull for
8007380 its kind of something that just happens through time you appreciate being a bulldog a little more the older you get and you kind of take things a little more serious out there you are kind of more focused and the young guys feed off of that because they know youve been through the tough times youve been through the ups and downs and youve been through a lot of the battles that they are going to see
8007381 ive been a part of a 9 4 team and an 11 2 team and i feel like we ended on a high note both years obviously playing hawaii and being able to beat them that would give us in the medias eyes a high ranking but i think our team considers itself a top team going into the season the hype has been increased tenfold i think thats something that comes with the territory but we arent thinking about it i know georgia southern doesnt care what we are ranked and i just know that this game is going to be really fun
8007382 its a lot different from practice in camp you are going against guys you know you think its kind of a competition and youve been going against them all camp now youre going against another group of receivers every single week and its something new to look forward to with every game you get more experience and you grow as a player so hopefully for the younger people that can help
8007383 all we can do is run hard and play fast we dont have that much stuff to see on them but all we can do is play hard and play fast and hopefully we can come out victorious
8007384 i try not to look at all the hype and all the different polls they have at the end of the day you still have to play ball and play games im proud im always proud of history and this is the first time in georgia history that weve been ranked no 1 but i really try not to read into the polls
8007385 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8007386 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8007387 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them

8007403 when our rivalry can unwittingly damage the business and employment prospects of indians in companies run by pakistanis and for pakistanis in companies run by british indians those who look back cannot look forward we must look forward to living in peace and harmony not only in britain but throughout the world for our own good

8007408 in todays podcast stepheni norton principal consultant at 21 cfr consulting llc discusses some of the common misconceptions surrounding fda regulation title 21 cfr part 11 as it relates to learning management systems validation
8007409 the fdas title 21 cfr part 11 regulation sets down criteria under which a company that is required by the fda to provide compliance training records may do so electronically as opposed to via paper records many such firms are in bio tech life sciences medical device manufacturing pharmaceuticals and other regulated industries
8007410 weve established valuable relationships with consumers who have regularly used lifeclinic blood pressure monitors to help them manage their blood pressure now with the lc600s wider array of biometric tests we can enhance their testing experience and at the same time educate them about the retailers products and services via cbss outernet digital signage network its a win win win situation for consumers product manufacturers and retail pharmacies
8007411 besides targeting and servicing the health and wellness needs of the retailers consumer which lifeclinics automated health stations do 1 000 000 times a day lifeclinic is dedicated to serving a population of people who are at the store almost every day the retailers employees
8007412 lifeclinic is committed to helping our retailer customers design and implement programs that can help control their organizations healthcare costs for example when our health stations identify an employee who is pre hypertensive there is an opportunity for early intervention and education to promote generally recommended lifestyle changes which in turn may allow the employee to forgo the need for costly medications visits to the doctor and missed days of work obviously this also benefits the employers bottom line for those people who our health stations identify as being hypertensive the employees healthcare provider can be called upon to immediately address factors such as lack of exercise unhealthy diet obesity and bad lifestyle habits and may also recommend inexpensive medication that will prevent the much higher costs of hospitalization and lost productivity

8007440 theres two solar industries theres a solar industry of the individual and i dont want to invest in that at all first solar is an industrial company they are not one to one they use large available pieces of real estate and they put their film solar panels on top of those and then sell the electricity theyre going to win a series of very big contracts theres no future for that one to one market its going to be industrial and only first solar right now is playing it when i say only there are others coming on which is an other reason why first solars multiple could shrink eventually

8007445 nederlanders zijn niet in staat om naar zichzelf te kijken vanuit een derde persoon hun eigen botte gedrag kunnen ze daarom niet waarnemen

8007452 this should be a grand time for ethanol with sales climbing and high gasoline prices making every alternative fuel more attractive but the ethanol push is looking like a noble idea gone bad
8007453 every day government takes actions aimed at helping industries some pan out some dont its how the government reacts and makes adjustments thats what matters most
8007454 it not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill any government policy that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
8007455 this should be a grand time for ethanol with sales climbing and high gasoline prices making every alternative fuel more attractive but the ethanol push is looking like a noble idea gone bad
8007456 the trick lies in striking a fair balance encouraging new development and innovation without biasing the system toward one player
8007457 when the government steps in and says were going to replace gasoline with x or y it cuts out all those smart people and instead replaces them with a lobby thats only purpose is to keep the subsidies flowing
8007458 we bought fertilizer and corn seed decided our crop mix on the basis of ethanol being where it was to change that mandate in the middle of our growing season thats really not right

8007465 bochornosa actitud del alcalde prohibiendo el debate sobre esta sentencia cuando s lo acept en la anterior no es m s que una muestra de un comportamiento antidemocr tico cuyo objetivo no es otro que amordazar a al oposici n
8007466 hacer uso de dinero p blico para perseguir judicialmente a ciudadanos que han mostrado opiniones pol ticas divergentes al alcalde es inmoral pol ticamente
8007467 macario ben tez ha recurrido a m todos que parecen demasiado al destierro vecinal resulta lamentable que el alcalde no hubiera aceptado esta sentencia y enfangue a todo el municipio en el bochorno de ser de nuevo condenado por el tsjc pues muestra una conducta caciquil

8007488 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
8007489 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
8007490 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised

8007515 although the parties could still join forces it leaves open the option of a standoff between liberty simon and westfield
8007516 both groups have now clearly pulled up a seat at the table
8007517 they could be either working together and looking to divide up the assets or the move by westfield could be a defensive move to try and keep new entrants out of this market
8007518 takeovers in this sector are driven by investors who believe that the net asset value is understated not the share price
8007519 and in the end i dont think you will get the discount the final price will be at net asset value

8007539 perhaps the presence of 223 million firearms in the united states or the fact that one in four households has a handgun elevates this issue to the status of a public health crisis

8007541 i love how ms walters has interspersed suspenseful twists in the sensual tale the meaty plot is emotion packed which is something i could easily sink my teeth into it is lovely to sit down with a good book and simply the enjoy the characters but ms walters has brought the story to life with her description of thescenery around jacksons farm and his passion about nature i enjoyed this book so much that i went to find other books in the awakening desires series as soon as i finished the fifth installment awakening desires 5 jacksonsjewel is an excellent choice for an empty afternoon

8007560 i had a guy from a national newspaper track me down and say have you got any comment to make all of your new album has come up on the internet and i was going its impossible its ludicrous because only four or five people had copies so i said read out the song titles that are up on the internet and he read out the track listing from the last album so i was like thats on the internet is it its also in hmv in the o section you idiot
8007561 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into lars ulrich mode about this
8007562 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
8007563 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law

8007582 i remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to able to contain the fire
8007583 i said you know weve had such terrible loss of life
8007584 and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse
8007585 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
8007586 the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
8007587 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
8007588 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
8007589 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
8007590 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
8007591 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
8007592 you know weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is is

8007669 includes a radio clip of john lennon speaking shortly before his death in 1980 but he says its not meant to be an ode to his musical hero as some british press have suggested
8007670 people are sort of going on about this tribute to john lennon its not a tribute to john

8007679 i was playing some drums on some demos left over from the last record
8007680 we sent them to producer dave sardy and he was like wow have you got any more songs like this we should make a record like this
8007681 and then going back to the stuff we ditched in the past we were like yeah we could do something with that or do something with this
8007682 slowly but surely it all started to change from a traditional british rock album to this whatever one we would describe it now

8007898 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease

8007901 increases in the prevalence of these risk factors may have contributed to the upward trend in incidence
8007902 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8007903 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8007904 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8007905 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8007906 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8007907 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8007908 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8007909 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8007910 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up

8007913 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection because studies conducted before haart was introduced in the mid 1990s did not detect the problem
8007914 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted
8007915 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8007916 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8007917 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8007918 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8007919 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8007920 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8007921 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8007922 alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the postoperative post traumatic and other inpatient settings is a potentially life threatening condition that is difficult to identify in its early stages and difficult to treat in its later stages
8007923 we employed a standardized treatment protocol which identified at risk patients early and began treatment at the first signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome

8007968 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
8007969 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
8007970 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
8007971 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
8007972 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
8007973 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
8007974 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
8007975 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
8007976 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
8007977 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

8008039 an international criminal gang has pulled off one of the most audacious cyber crimes ever and stolen the identities of an estimated eight million people in a hacking raid that could ultimately net more than 2 8 billion british pounds in illegal funds

8008082 nevertheless we are cautiously optimistic that home sales are approaching a bottom and that the newly enacted first time home buyer tax credit which went into effect as part of the housing stimulus bill on july 30 will help stimulate sales and provide crucial support for a market turnaround

8008165 through a highly targeted clear and concise website that is of value to the customer
8008166 s that should be ebays problem i just drove them to the site like i was supposed to do famous last words
8008167 my site drives very targeted traffic to ebay i often hear from my visitors how much they enjoy my site and use the ebay links on my site i cant imagine how much better a site can be targeted than mine offering more than just ebay ads but a lot of other information related to the topic my site ranks 1 for most ebay searches for this topic and it was all earned not purchased who can possibly stand up to whatever standards they require
8008168 ive been affiliating for ebay for over a year as well and never used any practices to drive traffic that could be construed and questionable
8008169 i totally depend on ebay i have been an affiliate for almost two years this is my year to date earnings clicks 189684 epc 7 50 income 14 220 95 i have e mailed ebay to try and find out what exactly i did wrong we should be given a warning to fix correct or stop any unethical behavior that we are not aware of
8008170 ive been an ebay affiliate for 3 years now and my site is 11 years old
8008171 with epn i had high hopes dreams aspirations of true success gone are those days
8008172 how can ebay treat its affiliates this way ive invested countless hours developing and adding content to my sites for epn to drop me
8008173 just got my email ebay affiliate for several years high quality niche sites no junk no spam no black hat ebay listings are on my blog sites one gets 20 000 visitors daily many go to ebay and buy like some of you above significant ebay income mid to high 5 figures yearly
8008174 we actually built our community around ebay i cant tell you how much traffic weve driven to ebay it just hurts me that ive worked so hard with ebay and to have formed such a great community now over this and now my incentive to keep going is gone like ive been kicked in the teeth as a thank you for driving traffic that would not have otherwise been driven there
8008175 i got the boot also i just spent over 2000 and countless hours getting my epn setup
8008176 we have been with ebay for over 6 years total motorcycle is a top website worldwide the leading motorcycle website in north america and gets 1
8008177 i was a small guy i made less that 1000 this year with epn so it is not just the big ones they want out
8008178 after 19 very good months as an ebay affilate the epn network has sent me my expiration email i am unaware of what i have done i am a disabled vietnam vet confined to my home and trying to eek out a living from the web this seemed to be a wonderful way to do it now it seems like all this will come to an end
8008179 ebay has hurt people here and still is not classy enough to respond a good business practice might have involved a warning to improve your sites or performance even google does that
8008180 last december i found something i really loved to do ebay affiliate marketing
8008181 what adds to the insult is not even a peep from epn at least come on here and say were looking into this on a case by case basis ive never seem customer service run like this or an affiliate program
8008182 this is just sick a flawed system running wild the rude part about it for the rest of us left in the program is the not knowing why every one is getting booted and are we next

8008309 just the spin offs are annoying the hurt the industry as a whole
8008310 but despite all of this and despite the brilliant super mario galaxy mario kart on the wii and super paper mario on the ds
8008311 i think mario should retire from the endless spin offs and just focus on the rpgs and platformers
8008312 well obviously mario sports titles are doing something right as they sell millions

8008315 you see a much better alignment of production with market demands
8008316 youll see a lot of brands we traditionally have high depreciation rates for

8008318 every little step helps and if you cant afford new windows or storm windows plastic film kits arent a bad alternative
8008319 but there are a lot of other good hybrid cars out there that didnt make much of a fanfare that still qualify for tax credits
8008320 i am thinking of things like the nissan altima hybrid it competes with the camry and is a very solid car it is a large car gets good mileage and is just very exciting
8008321 to be brutally honest there has been nothing new or exciting in hybrid technology in a while
8008322 everyone is holding their breath to see what toyota has up their sleeve with the 09 prius

8008324 cancer patients deserve the right to fight for their lives without risking their own and their families financial security
8008325 a study by kaiser and harvard last year looked at issues of adequacy in health insurance for cancer patients and found that one in five who had insurance used all or most of their savings during the course of their treatment
8008326 there are any number of reasons for hypermiling global security global warming local smog currency translations or trade deficits or it could just be that you want more money in your pocket instead of giving it to the gas station
8008327 the environment is becoming more consumer friendly as more states and health plans adopt independent review processes

8008341 we have completely decoupled the metadata management from the application server its something we call the profile service and this profile service as you can imagine is fully pluggable it could be simply a set of files it can be a database it can be a jcr repository and the idea here is to end up with a unified way to store metadata for one node or a cluster or a farm of jboss instances and very quickly provision new instances
8008342 i think in the future its going to be increasingly important to further split some of the notions which today are still linked way too much as part of a monolithic entity i think metadata is something that will be very important what i call metadata you know its a non fancy name to describe everything that is being done in the various repositories out there when i look at the way that you configure an operating system or the way you populate an ldap tree the way you get access to the topology of your network everything you need to manage when i look at the configuration of an application server on esb or when i look at the various steps which need to go in an application before being validated and being able to go to production all of that is just metadata whatever fancy name you want to put on that being able to extract all of that information as part of a unified metadata repository i think is going to be a great step forward to enable the kind of provisioning we will need in the next years today i think we go through way too many ad hoc and manual processes to get there were not going to get the kind of economy of scale by doing so we need to radically go to another level
8008343 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8008344 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8008345 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8008346 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
8008347 nothing less than a boon for wall street and corporate executives

8008357 china is by far the worlds biggest manufacturer of steel last year it made more than one third of the 3 billion tons of steel produced in the entire world
8008358 we hope we will become the most competitive steelmaker in the worlds largest steel producing country at the end of this round of economic adjustment the best steelmakers will emerge stronger and the weak ones will disappear
8008359 from my perception some of the concerns about inflation and inflation expectations seem to have diminished
8008360 it should help to alleviate some of the inflation concerns and inflation pressures that we had been confronting assuming this sticks
8008361 my guess is its going to pay to be patient on interest rates at this point
8008362 i think itll take some time for these headwinds to diminish
8008363 in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt pick up a little more momentum first
8008364 if you wait till you have conclusive evidence you run the risk of waiting too long
8008365 the real message is that youve got to be willing at some point along the way to say you know i have enough confidence in my outlook that its time to go

8008368 an entry point to publish their content to a much broader audience than their own blogs afford
8008369 to realize our vision and have the capacity for what weve hoped to accomplish all along is a very positive validation of our method approach and world view what impresses me the most going forward is that we both have the same ultimate function in mind to enable the blogosphere our fuction is to help writers improve their writing and find their audience technoratis is almost 180 degrees and complimentary where they approach things from a purely algorithmical process theyre content agnostic content neutral and together we get to focus on our strengths and help each other they can send us traffic and we become their content source as part of technorati well be able to grow our respective communities and further improve our own platform to attract new audiences in the process
8008370 purely speculative things are much more complicated than that and more like a merger in some ways which people will begin to see very soon
8008371 getting ready for the launch we did massive amounts of performance testing built capacity model after capacity model and yet with all of that you threw so much traffic our way that we need to add more capacity we are adding that extra horsepower right now and should be back up shortly

8008395 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
8008396 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
8008397 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
8008398 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
8008399 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
8008400 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
8008401 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
8008402 we had a concern that this was going to happen
8008403 the adorability sinks back in by the end of the broadcast but by that time theyre talking about things like street fairs and adopting kittens so its fine
8008404 a phone poll of 1 000 adults during the closing weekend of the beijing games suggested that 32 would attend the london event up from 25 in february
8008405 well what do you think ought to be done to save your soul
8008406 it was dramatic the winds were blowing so heavy that the rain was going sideways
8008407 i cant imagine how traumatic it was being swept away by the water
8008408 if we have the same storm intensity it would be worse
8008409 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8008410 as much as john mccain would like us to believe hes different his economic plan offers not a single new idea just more of the same
8008411 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8008412 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8008413 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8008414 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8008415 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8008416 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8008417 i think that senator obama has tried to run a campaign of not attacking and of not polarizing the country and it has worked for him so far going down the road i dont know whether he needs to do more attacking and red meat or not but i will say that he has an expert in eating red meat in joe biden so im not worried about it
8008418 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8008419 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8008420 you may not think twice about posting your grandfathers name but youve just released your mothers maiden name
8008421 there are a lot of places where you can claim to forget other questions and the site will default to mothers maiden name if i give you the login to one account ive essentially given you a fish if i give you the answer to peoples password recovery questions ive taught you to fish you can pillage their accounts
8008422 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8008423 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8008424 from myspace to hip hop new media in the everyday lives of youth
8008425 the government doesnt have any plans to nationalize more companies
8008426 again i say to you if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my father in heaven
8008427 margie says to murphy would you like a picture taken with john kerry
8008428 they came up to the women and said we want you to leave the hotel
8008429 i called the guy over and said what did you say
8008430 then they escorted us out of the hotel and followed us down the block
8008431 the children were not at risk they were on the second floor of the home and asleep at the time of incident
8008432 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8008433 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8008434 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8008435 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
8008436 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going
8008437 in the first two cells we analyzed samples from the surface and the ice interface and the results look similar our objective for cell 3 is to use it as an exploratory cell to look at something that might be different
8008438 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
8008439 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
8008440 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
8008441 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
8008442 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
8008443 why does the information in google money pro goes against what all their other books say to do
8008444 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8008445 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know
8008446 it is not just that things are hard for people short term
8008447 it is the gnawing suspicion that maybe if we dont do anything about how this economy works that we may be passing on an america to the next generation that is a little poorer a little meaner than the america we inherited from our parents and our grandparents
8008448 i dont accept that future for my children and i do not accept it for yours i dont accept it for america and thats why i decided to run for president of the
8008449 will feature up to date information with daily press conferences via live streaming video news reports and rapid response research regarding why barack obama is not ready to be commander in chief
8008450 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
8008451 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care and had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
8008452 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8008453 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8008454 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8008455 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8008456 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8008457 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8008458 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8008459 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
8008460 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
8008461 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
8008462 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
8008463 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
8008464 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
8008465 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships
8008466 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8008467 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8008468 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8008469 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8008470 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8008471 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
8008472 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
8008473 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
8008474 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
8008475 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
8008476 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area
8008477 there are things that i wouldve fixed 10 to 15 years ago i dont have to touch anymore
8008478 we can actually measure the amount of decay to a number
8008479 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8008480 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8008481 hes gotten himself in remarkable shape i think our guys have done a great job in the rehab
8008482 but weve reached a point where weve sort of plateaued and looking out over the timeline we felt like it was going to take a few weeks without doing anything but maybe doing a little extra procedure might hurry things along
8008483 the quicker the better obviously because then you can kind of start back on the whole recovery thing
8008484 its too bad hes worked very hard and i know being a high profile pick a no 1 pick theres a lot of pressure put on that and expectations of fans its not his fault and hes trying his best to get back and were still counting on him to help us this year

8008488 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
8008489 recent economic data points towards a weakening of real gdp growth in the eurozone economy and a more accommodative monetary policy could be needed to prevent the region from falling into a recession
8008490 on the other hand the next step by the federal reserve policy makers will be to raise interest rates according to minutes of the federal open market committee meeting released on tuesday moreover the recent sell off in commodities particularly in oil should alleviate some downward pressure in the us economy

8008527 skeletal muscle strength and bulk are reduced in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and influence quality of life
8008528 exercise training during pulmonary rehabilitation can reverse some of these effects
8008529 we have evidence to suggest creatine uptake into muscles in the lung disease patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle creatine did not enhance training
8008530 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
8008531 this trial shows that creatine supplementation does not augment the substantial training effect of multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

8008537 in the past centuries there was a depletion of metals in human bodies but in todays post modern society we are actually overloaded with metals
8008538 its not necessarily that kind of practice needed at this time
8008539 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
8008540 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
8008541 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
8008542 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
8008543 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
8008544 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
8008545 it could be like something out of a greek myth
8008546 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
8008547 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
8008548 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
8008549 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
8008550 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
8008551 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
8008552 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
8008553 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
8008554 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
8008555 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
8008556 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
8008557 since last night russian helicopters are dropping bombs in the borjomi gorge in the area of borjomi kharagauli national park
8008558 i hope georgian science will recover from the current crisis equally fast and that we can all go back and resume our work there as soon as possible
8008559 unfortunately there is little else we can do other than wait from one day to the next for the russian occupation of half of our country to end
8008560 is welcome but it is trivial compared to the plunge over the past year
8008561 the federal reserve has become increasingly concerned about downside risks to growth to the economy these concerns are highlighted in these fomc minutes
8008562 it is apparent that buyers are stuck in a wait and see mode regarding energy prices more credit market write offs the housing situation inflation and geopolitical tensions
8008563 there is no safety issue at all its an efficiency issue
8008564 we are investigating what the problem was and in the meantime were managing the system and working with the airlines to make sure everything works as efficiently as we can have it work at this time
8008565 the backup system is working and is processing flight plans but because there were so many it had to handle it caused some delays in the system

8008576 it is not what goes into a mans mouth what defiles him for out of the heart comes evil thoughts
8008577 i really cant trust myself i must trust the word of god and the spirit
8008578 the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of their altars 2 while their children remember their altars and their asherim beside every green tree and on the high hills 3 on the mountains in the open country your wealth and all your treasures i will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory 4 you shall loosen your hand from your heritage that i gave to you and i will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever
8008579 i will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know
8008580 behold the days are coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and the house of judah 32 not like the covenant that i made with their fathers on the day when i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt my covenant that they broke though i was their husband declares the lord 33 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares the lord i will put my law within them and i will write it on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people 34 and no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
8008581 thats a funny question because i think you know who i am
8008582 in accordance with the eternal purpose which he carried out in christ jesus our lord
8008583 distinction between greek and jew circumcised and uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave and freeman but christ is all and in all
8008584 and it shall be that everyone meaning anyone not just jews who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
8008585 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
8008586 and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in god who created all things so that the manifold wisdom of god might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places
8008587 we could not be the glorious church you called us to be because we could not get together on the music
8008588 that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains that in proclaiming it i may speak boldly as i ought to speak
8008589 the one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense he who would destroy himself does it
8008590 as an ox goes to the slaughter or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool
8008591 he does not know even though he should that it will cost him his life
8008592 therefore be careful how you walk not as unwise men but as wise making the most of your time because the days are evil so then do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is
8008593 for we were also once foolish ourselves disobedient deceived enslaved to various lusts and pleasures
8008594 the wise man is cautious and turns away from evil but a fool is arrogant and careless
8008595 the prudent sees evil and hides himself but the naive go on and are punished for it
8008596 the law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming not the realities themselves for this reason it can never by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year make perfect those who draw near to worship if it could would they have not stopped being offered for the worshippers would have been cleansed once for all and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins but those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
8008597 when christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man made that is to say not a part of this creation he did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves but he entered the most holy place once and for all by his own blood having obtained eternal redemption
8008598 the time is coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah it will not be like the covenant i made with their forefathers when i took them by the hand to lead them out of egypt because they did not remain faithful to my covenant and i turned away from them declares the lord this is the covenant i will make with house of israel after that time declares the lord i will put my laws in the minds and write them on their hearts i will be their god and they will be my people no longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying know the lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more
8008599 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand

8008602 the settlement with motorola follows dtl licensing and settlement deals with nokia samsung cingular ericsson and lg

8008610 the european union therefore takes the leading position its a victory for sport and for the fundamental and common values of the people of the union
8008611 the comparison of the eu against china or the us is of course not entirely fair
8008612 these people want to create a single country called europe
8008613 when i go back into england and i go through heathrow airport im ashamed to be english
8008614 while we clean up were dancing you dropped a bomb on me
8008615 food can look taste and smell normal so you wont know the infection is there weeks after you purchased the contaminated products
8008616 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
8008617 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
8008618 i think all of us expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8008619 thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8008620 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other

8008639 we humans interact directly with pervasive reality we do not shake in impotent fury at the shades of dreams as that cunt kant might have you believe we as rational objective actors must live for our self interest anything else is madness
8008640 twenty years ago i was nothing giving to others worrying about the opinions of looters and moochers i tried everything to fill my empty life with booze and pussy christianity dianetics neuro linguistic programming now i possess a nice sized baseman organization creating really profitable films tv books toys and apparel as the great lady herself said happiness is the moral purpose of life there is no morality which does not promote the selfish interest of the individual it is by following our rational morality we rise above the animal the socialist
8008641 youre missing the true beauty of objectivism each of us is a rational selfish actor we each get to decide what makes us happy anything anything at all

8008650 the advantage of open source is that no single entity has authoritative control over a project
8008651 but one argument says open source is less secure and people can put bad things in it and thats true too
8008652 i dont believe that gay marriage is in line with gods word which is found in the bible

8008656 commodity prices drop due to technological improvements such as gm
8008657 perhaps if you calmed down a bit before you pushed post
8008658 wow pretty desperate tactics ill ignore most of your idiocy
8008659 youre one to lecture about humility you come across as an arrogant angry jerk
8008660 if i misunderstood something you wrote that would be your fault for being a crappy writer
8008661 gm has only been planted for ten kind of ruins your complete argument doesnt it
8008662 im sure its true that gm hasnt yet resulted in significantly higher productivity or lower costs
8008663 you need to learn not only the humility that you hilariously think i need you also need to develop a coherent argument and learn how to write it down because you havent even come close to making your case so far
8008664 what do you prefer driving on automatic or driving stick
8008665 because there are a lot of people that use myspace to promote there music there modeling or whatever entertainment there in

8008670 people get into ill conceived fitness plans because they hate it
8008671 they hate it because its drudgery and if they liked it they wouldnt be needing the plan
8008672 that can be useful but you have to know yourself
8008673 its easy to slack off its easy to fake that
8008674 but for many people if they were self starters they would already be jogging
8008675 studies show a lot of people have these episodes and dont even make it to the hospital
8008676 i would love to see all kids get an ekg if even one person could avoid what happened to me
8008677 there arent enough primary care providers in boston and potentially the state to do this
8008678 an ekg may identify more athletes with disease but it also produces many false positives that would create chaos in the system
8008679 the advocates for these things either arent aware of the number of kids participating in high school sports or dont consider the cost or the logistical problems
8008680 statistically when it comes to sudden death its young and black
8008681 the big issue now is can we make a three minute echo feasible enough to do on all kids
8008682 we would argue that if we can refine our protocol that if it can be done very quickly and at minimal cost its probably worth doing
8008683 i set out to make 12 new years resolutions to prove that someone with a defibrillator at 18 could live a normal life
8008684 i just remember crossing the finish line and thinking i just did this
8008685 a high number of wrong time errors is not surprising and given the lack of clinical significance of the errors observed is probably not a meaningful indicator of quality
8008686 so as that fat increases the insulin in the body just isnt strong enough to work against it and the person gets diabetes
8008687 it had the most powerful anti diabetic effect id ever seen
8008688 we are seeing a growing trend of people in early alzheimers who really retain the capacity to contribute
8008689 these are the voices of our mothers fathers sisters and brothers husbands and wives and they are telling us that alzheimers is a significant but not insurmountable problem
8008690 alzheimers is like a monster under the bed you have two choices you can either look under the bed and scope out the monster and see what tools you have to fight him or you can sit there and wait for him to come theres so much you can do if you know early on
8008691 it will almost certainly be these early stage patients who will lead the way toward new drugs since they are poised to benefit from them
8008692 open and frequent communication between parents and school staff is a key ingredient to keeping food allergic students out of harm it takes a partnership to establish effective avoidance strategies and emergency plans
8008693 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large

8008698 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
8008699 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8008700 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8008701 at the same time the great number of investors waiting on the sidelines ensures that the market will not freefall to a depression
8008702 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
8008703 well were really far behind this generation so why dont we hurry up and get to the next one and try our luck there
8008704 i think roanoke offers many career opportunities for young professionals and plenty of social events as well im proud to call roanoke home and with its affordable cost of living i look forward to more young people making roanoke their home as well its always about progress not perfection

8008717 the only thing we know at this point is the individual was working on a machine that wraps banding around pallets
8008718 for some unknown reason there was a malfunction on the machine and it trapped the individual
8008719 it was a new machine they were trying to set it up trying to make it work

8008743 parents must keep open communication with their children look for signs school administrators across the country have been sweeping this issue under the rug for too long students should be educated about the harmful effects of bullying every school should declare no bullying begins today
8008744 helping your children cope with either being a bully or being a victim often requires outside assistance such as from your childs school or the community school is the most likely place for bullying to occur so discuss your concerns with your childs teachers and counselor and ask what they can do to help school personnel can be influential in helping a child modify his behavior take advantage of any psychological counseling services that may be offered at your childs school or in your community

8008768 mining and a few of the other large industrial customers are carrying the full burden of the 10 demand reduction this is an industrial policy decision made by eskom with significant implications for this countrys economy especially for exports and employment

8008792 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8008793 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings amd results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8008794 studies have also demonstrated that patients with visual impairment tend to have longer hospitalisations make greater use of health and community care services and are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes
8008795 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8008796 weve been waiting for this for over two years it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8008797 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8008798 we believe these kinds of flexible options on the part of industry are part of the answer where nice has said no or where there is an issue about cost effectiveness
8008799 there is a range of different ways of dealing with the problem but there is no silver bullet
8008800 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 pcts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight the resulting stress and suffering has been cruel and unnecessary
8008801 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8008802 an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs
8008803 wet amd is a debilitating eye condition that can result in a rapid loss of sight if left untreated lucentis is a treatment for a key unmet medical need and it has the potential to save many peoples sight
8008804 they think they are heading straight to the final and fans are now voting for who they want to win
8008805 its going to be an emotional rollercoaster for those who have sat on the fence all this time because they will finally have to come clean about how they feel about the others
8008806 but missing out on a place in the final could be the best thing to ever happen to one of them
8008807 they have the potential to earn more than they if they had made it through to the final but fell at the last hurdle

8008811 this is good news and is entirely attributable to the availability of government programs like medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip
8008812 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the healthcare they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8008813 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes

8008836 in her confessional statement megha has claimed that she had broken off with kunal and that he was using the video clips to blackmail her into submission this according to her was the cause behind the murder
8008837 we are hunting for those clips which kunal is alleged to have used to blackmail megha
8008838 meghas parents were not aware of this alleged oppression of kunal he used to come to her house to give tuitions on computer science and her parents had a very high opinion of him this is in sharp contrast to meghas allegations
8008839 the suitcase with the couples blood stained clothes which was found at a garbage dump near meghas home has been sent to forensic experts for matching of samples and dna analysis blood samples taken from kunals abandoned scooter have also been sent to the forensic science laboratory

8008895 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8008896 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8008897 i think that senator obama has tried to run a campaign of not attacking and of not polarizing the country and it has worked for him so far going down the road i dont know whether he needs to do more attacking and red meat or not but i will say that he has an expert in eating red meat in joe biden so im not worried about it

8008943 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
8008944 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
8008945 i am only thinking about winning they were good in the first game but we were really poor if we improve and play at our level it will be difficult for them
8008946 if we are winning games and not playing well it means we should find it easier to win games when we do play well
8008947 with a 4 0 advantage we were maybe a bit under par
8008948 but we controlled the game we wanted to win we didnt want to lose

8008950 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
8008951 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8008952 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

8008980 the idea that you are going to sit around and figure out what percentage of the blame you are going to ascribe to the victim themselves is just completely misguided and improper
8008981 a case by case review is only as good as the rules that govern that review discretion vested in officials should not turn into a character assassination of the victim or be used to play out archaic gender stereotypes

8009059 el comportamiento del se or pinheiro de la se ora oporto especialmente la funcionalidad del se or exeni ante el poder ejecutivo no nos genera la confianza para seguir adelante con otro proceso por eso creemos que cuando se trate la designaci n de vocales la pr xima semana tiene que haber una recomposici n total de la cne
8009060 esto hay que saberlo entender como mandato como necesidad de esa manera las autonom as ya no ser n un pretexto de unas logias que enga an al pueblo que lo maltratan y le mienten
8009061 no es f cil convertir un proyecto partidario en un proyecto nacional eso se llama liderazgo hist rico nacional

8009063 con el pretexto del idh la derecha empez una huelga de hambre y tenemos informaci n de que no hab a ninguna huelga de hambre fracas la huelga convocaron a un paro en algunas regiones otro fracaso convocaron a un bloqueo de caminos otro fracaso

8009069 yo que siento compa eras y compa eros que la agon a de la derecha se expresa con decisiones que est n orientadas a castigar al pueblo boliviano
8009070 seguramente pensar n que est n castigando a evo morales en el fondo no est n castigando a evo morales est n castigando al pueblo boliviano y eso nos permite crear mayor conciencia contra esos grupos enemigos del pueblo boliviano

8009102 estos elementos permiten desarrollar esquem ticamente un ejercicio de factibilidad log stico y financiero que se basa en un ambiente operacional localizado en el departamento de santa cruz de la sierra particularmente en la capital del departamento dado que esta ciudad constituir a el probable objetivo estrat gico operacional de las fuerzas de represi n existen 5 rutas principales que confluyen hacia la ciudad y por lo tanto se ha tomado este n mero para determinar la cantidad de unidades y los sistemas de armas necesarios para la defensa de este objetivo un lote de 150 misiles antia reos port tiles con 30 lanzadores tipo sam 18 ruso suman us 10 500 000 y 300 misiles antitanques guiados tipo at 13 tambi n rusos con 30 lanzadores cuestan us 25 500 000 si bien las probabilidades de impacto de estos sistemas son altas con un modesto 50 ser a suficiente para destruir la totalidad de los aviones helic pteros y blindados que las fuerzas armadas bolivianas disponen en la actualidad dispar ndoles incluso fuera del alcance de las armas de los mismos la totalidad del material puede ser transportado en 4 contenedores de 40 pies de largo para materializar esta capacidad necesariamente se debe contar con personal instruido y entrenado lo que es poco factible dado el tiempo y medios requeridos la soluci n l gica es el contrato de un operador especializado al que se le deber pagar unos us 10 000 por mes o sea que los 50 hombres necesarios operando durante un lapso de 6 meses totalizan us 3 000 000 con esta cantidad de misiles pueden cubrir simult neamente con posiciones dobles hasta 15 avenidas de aproximaci n terrestres distintas y de igual manera defender de ataques a reos hasta 15 objetivos separados un aspecto indispensable es contar con elementos de infanter a para ocupar posiciones defensivas patrullar y brindar seguridad interior la organizaci n y equipamiento de 5 batallones de milicias de infanter a con 4 compa as de infanter a de 100 hombres cada una requerir 2 000 fusiles que en el caso de los kalashnicov ak 105 con 1 000 tiros cada uno incluidos suman us 1 000 000 adem s de 200 ametralladoras tipo pkm con 5 000 tiros cada una que cuestan otros us 400 000 el armamento y los 3 000 000 de tiros caben en 4 contenedores la defensa antitanque cercana es dada por 200 lanza granada cohete tipo rpg 7 con 10 granadas cohete por lanzador que se pueden adquirir por us 500 000 los lanzadores y las municiones ocupan 3 contenedores de esta forma las unidades estar n armadas con un arma antitanque y una ametralladora cada diez hombres lo que provee una muy aceptable potencia de fuego se debe contar con una dotaci n m nima de 200 visores nocturnos y 200 equipos de comunicaciones de corto y mediano alcance los que incrementar an sensiblemente las capacidades para el combate durante las 24 horas y el comando y control de las peque as fracciones con un costo adicional aproximado de us 300 000 el ltimo aspecto a considerar es la artiller a que puede ser organizada con cohetes bal sticos del tipo 122 mm de 20 km de alcance los que si bien no tienen las prestaciones de la artiller a de tubo convencional en especial la precisi n tienen la posibilidad de ser disparados desde lanzadores m ltiples o por lanzadores individuales fabricados artesanalmente este sistema es de gran movilidad relativa y su servicio de pieza requiere muy breve entrenamiento un cargamento de 1 200 cohetes en 4 contenedores tiene un costo de us 300 000 y permitir an disparar con una cadencia de 40 cohetes diarios durante un mes la totalidad del material y los contratistas totalizan un monto de us 41 500 000 transportables en 15 contenedores en conclusi n el factor militar representa el m s grave impedimento para cualquier intento secesionista en bolivia desde el punto de vista material se desprende que a n contando con contactos internacionales y financiamiento para la adquisici n de armamento se requerir an numerosas y coordinadas complicidades para ingresar una carga de esas dimensiones a trav s de los puestos aduaneros y policiales que controlan los accesos fluviales y terrestres del pa s a n cuando muchos de estos se encuentran localizados en departamentos que constituir an el probable escenario de conflicto sin duda un balance prospectivo debe ser hecho entre al costo de vidas y los objetivos a conquistar con la independencia lo que es el primer punto a tener en cuenta para evaluar la aceptabilidad de una decisi n de esa magnitud la secesi n inevitablemente escalar a en un conflicto armado de imprevisible intensidad y duraci n en el cual los pa ses vecinos y la regi n toda se ver an seriamente comprometidos
8009103 contraofensiva criolla fue consecuencia del proyecto de reconstrucci n de un pasado y proyecto ruralizante de morales
8009104 la deuda con venezuela se dispar desde 2005 a o de la victoria electoral de evo morales
8009105 dos clases de contradicciones sociales se superponen en bolivia la clasista pobres contra ricos y la regional autonomistas versus centralistas como la primera es m s fuerte que la segunda el gobierno ocupa mejores posiciones electorales y pol ticas
8009106 se ha visto claramente la amplia magnitud que ha proporcionado el pueblo boliviano hacia la continuidad del cambio que propone el gobierno morales
8009107 el presidente en estos momentos oscila entre el 67 4 de votaci n a nivel nacional y por ah tendr amos que ver qu es lo que quiere el pueblo frente a esa situaci n
8009108 adem s es necesario explicar que en primera instancia el presidente ha convocado fraternalmente a un di logo abierto y sincero a todas las regiones es decir a los prefectos y alcaldes para que puedan tomar cartas en el asunto sobre este tema pero hemos visto claramente que ese di logo no ha sido realmente fruct fero por razones de interponer sus intereses personales de cada uno de los prefectos
8009109 lo que tendr amos que analizar es el motivo por el cual realmente est n ocurriendo estos problemas uno es la devoluci n del idh impuesto directo a los hidrocarburos que ha sido descontado a principios de gesti n es para que a trav s del tesoro general de la naci n se pueda otorgar un monto significativo a todas aquellas personas mayores de edad como el bono dignidad
8009110 este bono es para aquellas personas que justamente necesitan la ayuda del gobierno pero estas regiones que est n solicitando la devoluci n del idh lo hacen justamente como medio de presi n a trav s de paros huelgas e incluso bloqueo de caminos que realmente estar an yendo contra las disposiciones legales en actual vigencia
8009111 yo creo que tiene que ser a la brevedad posible este di logo este reencuentro regional entre el presidente y la oposici n porque es la nica forma de poder establecer la paz en bolivia de otra manera no hay otra salida porque sus planteamientos son muy r gidos y la oposici n no presenta propuestas para poder solucionar estos problemas
8009112 las operaciones de ingreso al y salida del territorio nacional de divisas
8009113 latinoam rica no tiene la capacidad para construir un anillo energ tico
8009114 el cono sur de am rica tiene potencial gas fero pero bolivia a n est considerada entre los pa ses no atractivos para las inversiones junto a argentina y ecuador en bolivia hay dificultad en el entendimiento de los actores lo que impide relanzar el sector lo que demorar unos cuatro a os
8009115 este decreto busca garantizar las reservas a partir del pr ximo a o y asegur tener la suficiente energ a para atender la demanda actual
8009116 en puno varias comunidades campesinas producen algunas toneladas de oro pero all s lo se observa pobreza y violencia
8009117 los dirigentes de la cooperativa son muy activos viajan por lima y el mundo est n muy enterados de los precios del mineral pero esa din mica gremial no favorece a sus asociados

8009122 costas al ser adulto cronol gico y biol gico tiene una autoestima baja y a su edad no puede ser muy alta eso se traduce en un discurso agresivo que es un mecanismo de defensa para camuflar su baja autoestima y su inmadurez emocional
8009123 estas personas costas cuentan con un grupo social que respalda su pensamiento y para ellos uno est con ellos o est en contra de ellos
8009124 como pol tico tiene que tener la capacidad y habilidad para traducir lo que quieren los otros pero cuando pierde esa capacidad confunde su necesidad con la respuesta de los dem s y si no encuentra esto se frustra y por eso insulta utilizando un lenguaje procaz
8009125 el gobierno peruano no est de acuerdo con la exigencia
8009126 buscar un nuevo secretario general de la can de consenso
8009127 esto puede da ar mucho lo trabajado en m s de 40 a os
8009128 es una torpeza diplom tica y jugada pol tica e incluso una venganza contra ecuador
8009129 no menos favorable que el que otorguen a sus propios nacionales
8009130 lo que hace es modificar temporalmente lo que cada pa s quiere hacer si es que quiere hacerlo es decir es una opci n y no una obligaci n
8009131 ha estado siempre muy cercano a bolivia y es amigo del canciller choquehuanca
8009132 nicamente en funci n de los intereses de la can y antepuso los intereses de per de adaptar la normativa andina al tratado de libre comercio que los peruanos firmaron con estados unidos
8009133 despu s de 38 a os de historia de la can por primera vez se procedi a aprobar una decisi n con el voto negativo de un pa s
8009134 no agot ni promovi una pausa efectiva para buscar una f rmula de consenso sino que permiti la prosecuci n de una sesi n absolutamente irregular y que sienta un precedente funesto para el proceso de integraci n andino
8009135 para que se invertir en semejante obra si en bolivia no hay el suficiente gas para enviar a trav s de ese tubo
8009136 la conflictividad en bolivia impone posponer los plazos ellos necesitan desarrollar m s reservas para cumplir con sus compromisos de exportaci n y no se puede encarar seriamente un proyecto con dudas sobre el futuro suministro
8009137 3 a os antes de la fecha tope del acuerdo de suministro podr an llegar cantidades menores a trav s de tgn inicialmente y luego por el nuevo gasoducto
8009138 nuevos planes de inversi n est n en an lisis no solo en lo privado sino tambi n en lo p blico
8009139 suficientes reservas para atender las necesidades de demanda del mercado interno y los mercados de exportaci n por las siguientes d cadas
8009140 cuenta con un potencial de exploraci n bastante atractivo desde el punto de vista geol gico
8009141 un problema muy serio con el compa ero evo morales y el gas importado de all
8009142 dijimos que no quer amos dejar de importar el gas de bolivia pero que no quer amos seguir dependiendo de solamente un pa s sino ampliar las posibilidades y tener otros proveedores para tener m s flexibilidad y garantizar la seguridad
8009143 no va a faltar energ a en este pa s

8009147 el prefecto de santa cruz rub n costas est en un proceso de franca conspiraci n y desestabilizaci n de la democracia en el pa s es algo as como un prefecto de la violencia y del insulto
8009148 es un prefecto que no ha entendido el resultado del refer ndum revocatorio del domingo y que no quiere ingresar en un proceso de concertaci n y de di logo
8009149 el gobierno va a seguir tendi ndoles la mano va a seguir proponiendo un di logo una concertaci n para resolver los problemas del pa s en el mbito m s pac fico posible
8009150 el objetivo pol tico que est n buscando es la desestabilizaci n del gobierno y el derrocamiento del presidente evo morales lo intentaron el 10 de agosto y no lo lograron por eso est n armando una estrategia para la divisi n del pa s
8009151 lo que est n buscando los prefectos derechistas es una especie de separatismo porque saben que sus privilegios se les acabaron y esos privilegios que ten an est n queriendo cuidar y har n todo lo humanamente posible y hasta lo imposible por preservarlos
8009152 la soluci n m s simple es que el presidente evo morales d un autogolpe cierre el congreso despida jueces nombre jueces por decreto y se proclame autoridad suprema con el respaldo de dos tercios de la poblaci n y vamos a la c rcel con toda la gente que hace eso yo creo que esa es la imagen que ellos quieren llevar adelante y que el gobierno no va aceptar ese reto
8009153 lamentablemente el mas fiel a su l nea reformista desconoce y no aplica las demandas contenidas en las agendas de lucha del pueblo boliviano manteniendo la pol tica econ mica neoliberal y ocasionando las crisis y problemas econ micos que son propias del modelo la inflaci n desempleo el hambre y miseria son flagelos de esa pol tica econ mica que vivimos durante d cadas desde que se impone el neoliberalismo a trav s del 21060
8009154 los acuerdos pactos y concesiones cedidas por el mas a la minor a olig rquica es parte de su pol tica de conciliaci n y entendimiento con el enemigo de clase utilizando el cuento de convertir en socios a los patrones
8009155 no existe otra opci n que el de preparar las fuerzas del proletariado y del pueblo para una confrontaci n final y violenta contra la oligarqu a y el imperialismo ndr donde la victoria de los trabajadores y pueblo har n posible la construcci n de una nueva y verdadera sociedad de las mayor as
8009156 la unidad de los trabajadores del campo y la ciudad naciones originarias clase media empobrecida y pueblo todo de bolivia contra la minor a olig rquica y terrateniente que pretende dividir el pa s a trav s de los comit s c vicos de la media luna entidades empresariales y trasnacionales y partidos pol ticos neoliberales reciclados como un podemos mnr mir nfr etc

8009159 hay personas que van agrediendo atacando que van realizando acciones totalmente injustas entonces siento que es una forma de no respeto a la poblaci n hablan de tomar instituciones eso es pr cticamente un golpe civil al estado boliviano
8009160 tambi n siento que ofender a la polic a a su mando nico es como dec a nuestro comandante miguel gemio descuartizar las instituciones y por lo tanto al estado boliviano intentar tomar instituciones fraccionar a la polic a nacional es pr cticamente dividir a bolivia
8009161 hay personas que van agrediendo que van realizando acciones totalmente injustas entonces siento que es una forma de no respeto a la poblaci n hablan de tomar instituciones eso es pr cticamente un golpe civil al estado boliviano
8009162 el pretexto de recuperar parte del impuesto directo a los hidrocarburos idh y las autonom as no lograr n fraccionar a la polic a nacional
8009163 ahora hacen tanto l o para controlar estos recursos naturales pero el gobierno seguir distribuyendo el pueblo boliviano y sus instituciones

8009397 well youve got to so there now its put out ready
8009398 it will upset that lad when i tell him how bad it is id better be careful
8009399 its not really dangerous but the nurse says its a dreadful smash
8009400 of course he says hes going to die it wouldnt be him if he didnt im done for my lass he said looking at me dont be so silly i said to him youre not going to die of a broken leg however badly its smashed i sll niver come out of ere but in a wooden box he groaned well i said if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box when youre better ive no doubt they will if we think its good for him said the sister shes an awfully nice sister but rather strict
8009401 and he looked at me when i came away i said i sll have to go now walter because of the train and the children and he looked at me it seems hard
8009402 when id got halfway to keston i found id come out in my working boots and look at them
8009403 i didnt know what to do with myself for shame
8009404 i found barker at the hospital he did look bad poor little fellow well i said to him what sort of a journey did you have with him dunna ax me missis he said ay i said i know what hed be but it wor bad for him mrs morel it wor that he said i know i said at ivry jolt i thought my eart would ha flown clean out o my mouth he said an the scream e gives sometimes missis not for a fortune would i go through wi it again i can quite understand it i said its a nasty job though he said an one asll be a long while afore its right again im afraid it will i said i like mr barker i do like him theres something so manly about him
8009405 for a man like your father the hospital is hard he cant understand rules and regulations and he wont let anybody else touch him not if he can help it when he smashed the muscles of his thigh and it had to be dressed four times a day would he let anybody but me or his mother do it he wouldnt so of course hell suffer in there with the nurses and i didnt like leaving him im sure when i kissed him an came away it seemed a shame
8009406 ive got to go and look for advertisements for a job
8009407 hes going to the co op reading room to look in the papers for a place he cant get a job i suppose hes living on his mother
8009408 what does a lad of thirteen want in a reading room with a newspaper
8009409 i was fat like him and like a dog in the sun i wish i was a pig and a brewers waggoner
8009410 unless you saw all the other men chasing her too you feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd but take care and see how you feel when you find yourself alone and in triumph
8009411 if you saw her mother you would know how i feel tall and elegant with the clearest of clear transparent olive complexions hair as black as jet and such grey eyes bright mocking like lights on water at night it is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her and she dresses as well as any woman in london i tell you your son doesnt half put his head up when she goes walking down piccadilly with him
8009412 youve only written four letters and the third is answered youre lucky my boy as i always said you were
8009413 careering round as if it thought it was a circus
8009414 wouldnt that just suit our annie and for one and eleven three isnt that cheap
8009415 good morning i came with my son paul morel you asked him to call this morning

8009422 but wasnt mr jordan common mother does he own it all
8009423 i suppose he was a workman who has got on
8009424 you mustnt mind people so much theyre not being disagreeable to their way you always think people are meaning things for you but they dont
8009425 look now shes taking that man his pudding and he came long after us
8009426 and look at keeps and boots and one or two places shall we
8009427 they make your mouth water ive wanted some of those for years but i sll have to wait a bit before i get them
8009428 so there is red and white but really i never knew stocks to smell like it
8009429 youd think every second as the flowers was going to fall off they hang so big an heavy
8009430 and the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots
8009431 yes beastly cold sunless hole it kills every bit of a plant you put in and the kitchen chokes them to death
8009432 wont it be nice for me to come out at dinner times
8009433 i can go all round here and see everything i sll love it
8009434 that william promised me when he went to london as hed give me a pound a month he has given me ten shillings twice and now i know he hasnt a farthing if i asked him not that i want it only just now youd think he might be able to help with this ticket which id never expected
8009435 he earns a hundred and thirty pounds but theyre all alike theyre large in promises but its precious little fulfilment you get
8009436 and am supposed to find money for extras but they dont care about helping you once theyve gone hed rather spend it on that dressed up creature
8009437 she should have her own money if shes so grand
8009438 she should but she hasnt i asked him and i know he doesnt buy her a gold bangle for nothing i wonder whoever bought me a gold bangle
8009439 the photograph of louie is very striking and i can see she must be attractive but do you think my boy it was very good taste of a girl to give her young man that photo to send to his mother the first certainly the shoulders are beautiful as you say but i hardly expected to see so much of them at the first view
8009440 hm ers a bright spark from th look on er an one as wunna do him owermuch good neither who is she
8009441 a lady is she an how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o game on
8009442 on nothing she lives with an old aunt whom she hates and takes what bit of moneys given her
8009443 then hes a fool to ha taen up wi such a one as that
8009444 im sorry you didnt like the photograph it never occurred to me when i sent it that you mightnt think it decent however i told gyp that it didnt quite suit your prim and proper notions so shes going to send you another that i hope will please you better shes always being photographed in fact the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing

8009495 its a beastly journey and we had such a rush
8009496 no dad keep your own chair sit on the sofa gyp
8009497 shes shy yet mother shes not used to it its different from her aunts house you know
8009498 of course it is my boy and she must find it difficult
8009499 its only her first awkwardness my boy shell be all right
8009500 you know shes not like you mother shes not serious and she cant think
8009501 yes and shes had no sort of show her mother died when she was a child since then shes lived with her aunt whom she cant bear and her father was a rake shes had no love
8009502 and so you have to forgive her a lot of things
8009503 i dunno when she seems shallow you have to remember shes never had anybody to bring her deeper side out and shes fearfully fond of me
8009504 but you know different from us those sort of people like those she lives amongst they dont seem to have the same principles
8009505 was she really getting up when she said she was
8009506 shall i have to send you an easter egg up there
8009507 chubby dear that question is not permitted is it mrs morel
8009508 oh annie do you know where i left my muff
8009509 you know it is in your bedroom why do you ask annie
8009510 it is not late my boy but it is as late as i usually sit up
8009511 and leave you two no my boy i dont believe in it
8009512 whether i can or not i wont do it you can stay till eleven if you like and i can read
8009513 my boy i tell you i dont believe in leaving two young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed
8009514 you know mother when im away from her i dont care for her a bit i shouldnt care if i never saw her again but then when im with her in the evenings i am awfully fond of her
8009515 but so much between us now i couldnt give her up
8009516 but if it is as you say i wouldnt call it love at any rate it doesnt look much like it
8009517 you know mr leivers has gone to live on a new farm well he asked me last week if i wouldnt go and see mrs leivers and i promised to bring you on monday if its fine shall we go
8009518 awfully you are a fine little woman to go jaunting out with
8009519 if i was walking down the street behind you i should say doesnt that little person fancy herself
8009520 oh no she wants to be in dirty black looking as if she was wrapped in burnt paper it does suit you and i say you look nice
8009521 its cost me just three shillings you couldnt have got it ready made for that price could you
8009522 why dont you buy some false white hair and stick it on your head
8009523 im afraid youll have to put up with one my lad
8009524 look how it heaps together like something alive almost a big creature that you dont know
8009525 and all the trucks standing waiting like a string of beasts to be fed
8009526 but i like the feel of men on things while theyre alive theres a feel of men about trucks because theyve been handled with mens hands all of them
8009527 i can feel a bit of a path this road
8009528 no go away i will do it in my own way
8009529 now are you sure were not a bother to you
8009530 oh no were only too thankful to see a new face its so lost up here
8009531 i suppose they are cabbage roses when they come out
8009532 and i suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after
8009533 i cant find time to look after cattle and im not used to it its as much as i can do to keep going in the house
8009534 she knocks you and nips you but she never hurts
8009535 dursnt jump off a gate dursnt tweedle dursnt go on a slide dursnt stop a girl hittin her she can do nowt but go about thinkin herself somebody the lady of the lake yah
8009536 not such a clown shall anger me a boor is answered silently
8009537 only she bumps a bit shes ever so neat if she wasnt look how much ground shed peck up every day
8009538 its a nice little place if only it werent for the rabbits the pastures bitten down to nothing i dunno if ever i sll get the rent off it
8009539 wouldnt i see to the fowls and the young stock and id learn to milk and id talk with him and id plan with him my word if i were his wife the farm would be run i know but there she hasnt the strength she simply hasnt the strength she ought never to have been burdened like it you know im sorry for her and im sorry for him too my word if id had him i shouldnt have thought him a bad husband not that she does either and shes very lovable
8009540 you look nice enough if thats what you want to know
8009541 thats the fourth pair shes lost since christmas at five shillings a pair
8009542 would you care to go on with it for a few minutes
8009543 read a book why shes never read a book in her life
8009544 er canna see what there is i books ter sit borin your nose in em for nor more can i
8009545 but its true mother she cant read what did you give her
8009546 well i gave her a little thing of annie swans nobody wants to read dry stuff on sunday afternoon
8009547 well ill bet she didnt read ten lines of it
8009548 oh well ive gone too far to break off now
8009549 and so i shall get married as soon as i can
8009550 very well my boy if you will you will and theres no stopping you but i tell you i cant sleep when i think about it
8009551 she didnt ask me but one morning and it was cold i found her on the station shivering not able to keep still so i asked her if she was well wrapped up she said i think so so i said have you got warm underthings on and she said no they were cotton i asked her why on earth she hadnt got something thicker on in weather like that and she said because she had nothing and there she is a bronchial subject i had to take her and get some warm things well mother i shouldnt mind the money if we had any and you know she ought to keep enough to pay for her season ticket but no she comes to me about that and i have to find the money
8009552 but i cant give her up now its gone too far
8009553 and besides for some things i couldnt do without her
8009554 my boy remember youre taking your life in your hands
8009555 nothing is as bad as a marriage thats a hopeless failure mine was bad enough god knows and ought to teach you something but it might have been worse by a long chalk
8009556 remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an engagement
8009557 well go to bed my son youll feel better in the morning and perhaps youll know better
8009558 if you dont believe me what shes like would you believe she has been confirmed three times
8009559 nonsense or not she has thats what confirmation means for her a bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure
8009560 once in bromley once in beckenham and once somewhere else
8009561 it was and if it wasnt why were you confirmed twice
8009562 i can quite understand it child take no notice of him you ought to be ashamed william saying such things
8009563 but its true shes religious she had blue velvet prayer books and shes not as much religion or anything else in her than that table leg gets confirmed three times for show to show herself off and thats how she is in everything everything
8009564 you might as well ask a fly to love you
8009565 if you want to say these things you must find another place than this i am ashamed of you william why dont you be more manly to do nothing but find fault with a girl and then pretend youre engaged to her
8009566 but it doesnt mother shes very much in love with me now but if i died shed have forgotten me in three months
8009567 you dont know and therefore youve no right to say such a thing
8009568 in three months after i was buried youd have somebody else and i should be forgotten
8009569 im afraid hes ruining himself against that creature who isnt worthy of his love no no more than a rag doll
8009570 ive seemed to have a dragging cold all the last month but its going i think
8009571 and yet you know mother for all that if i died shed be broken hearted for two months and then shed start to forget me youd see shed never come home here to look at my grave not even once
8009572 youre not going to die so why talk about it
8009573 and she cant help it she is like that and if you choose her well you cant grumble
8009574 here put a bit of this soothing ointment on you should wear different collars
8009575 owing to a leakage in the hold of this vessel the sugar had set and become converted into rock
8009576 he got home at six oclock on monday morning and he seemed to sleep all day then in the night we heard him talking and this morning he asked for you so i wired and we fetched the doctor
8009577 i want my father hes got to go to london
8009578 tha wants walter morel go in theer an tell joe ward
8009579 i want my father hes got to go to london
8009580 walter morels wanted number 42 hard summats amiss theres his lad here
8009581 and william is dead and my mothers in london and what will she be doing
8009582 the coffin will be here to night walter youd better see about some help
8009583 mother miss jordan was down to day and she said my sketch of a colliery at work was beautiful
8009584 mr jordan gave me five shillings for a christmas box
8009585 might he never have had it if id kept him at home not let him go to nottingham
8009586 it was a good thing paul was ill that christmas i believe it saved his mother
8009587 i was at a ball last night some delightful people were there and i enjoyed myself thoroughly
8009588 your daffodils are nearly out isnt it early but dont they look cold
8009589 let me take your coat it is heavy you mustnt walk far in it
8009590 isnt it lovely coming out dont you think i saw a sloe bush in blossom and a lot of celandines im glad its sunny
8009591 can i give you anything to eat or to drink
8009592 i think shes tired now i think shes had too much to do perhaps in a little while shell go to skegness with me then shell be able to rest i sll be glad if she can
8009593 only miriam knows what a trouble they make if the potatoes are caught
8009594 yes edgar i forgot them for a minute perhaps youll have bread if you cant eat them
8009595 what was miriam doing that she couldnt attend to them
8009596 and i believed in you i cant stand it when you wrangle
8009597 yes dear but how often have i asked you not to answer edgar back cant you let him say what he likes
8009598 arent you strong enough to bear it miriam if even for my sake are you so weak that you must wrangle with them
8009599 its almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the bird
8009600 its so warm they say a bird makes its nest round like a cup with pressing its breast on it then how did it make the ceiling round i wonder
8009601 when their petals go flat back with the sunshine they seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun
8009602 though the lads were strong and healthy yet they had all that over sensitiveness and hanging back which made them so lonely yet also such close delicate friends once their intimacy was won paul loved them dearly and they him
8009603 but its a treat of a a real treat of a swing
8009604 keep your heels up or theyll bang the manger wall
8009605 they say if you can swing you wont be sea sick
8009606 its because there is scarcely any shadow in it its more shimmery as if id painted the shimmering protoplasm in the leaves and everywhere and not the stiffness of the shape that seems dead to me only this shimmeriness is the real living the shape is a dead crust the shimmer is inside really
8009607 i wanted that now look at them and tell me are they pine trunks or are they red coals standing up pieces of fire in that darkness theres gods burning bush for you that burned not away
8009608 but even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness
8009609 because youre not because youre different inside like a pine tree and then you flare up but youre not just like an ordinary tree with fidgety leaves and jolly
8009610 what is it im all day cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes i dont want to be at home
8009611 i want to do something i want a chance like anybody else why should i because im a girl be kept at home and not allowed to be anything what chance have i
8009612 of knowing anything of learning of doing anything its not fair because im a woman
8009613 but its as well to be a woman as a man
8009614 i should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men are to be men
8009615 i want to learn why should it be that i know nothing
8009616 i knew your step nobody treads so quick and firm
8009617 but i came on purpose and if you want to learn it you must begin
8009618 yes but to night you see i havent thought of it
8009619 its only letters for figures you put down a instead of 2 or 6
8009620 you dont learn algebra with your blessed soul cant you look at it with your clear simple wits
8009621 paul dont be so hard on miriam she may not be quick but im sure she tries
8009622 if the land were nationalized edgar and paul and i would be just the same
8009623 i can do my best things when you sit there in your rocking chair mother
8009624 they seem as if they walk like butterflies and shake themselves
8009625 she is one of those who will want to suck a mans soul out till he has none of his own left
8009626 and he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed she will never let him become a man she never will
8009627 she must be wonderfully fascinating that you cant get away from her but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night
8009628 its not do you think we spoon and do we only talk
8009629 i dont say i dont like her but i dont hold with children keeping company and never did
8009630 but you dont mind our annie going out with jim inger
8009631 its so pretty in the country mr sleath asked about you he said hed missed you are you a bit better
8009632 i ought to have been in bed a long time ago
8009633 why mother you know you wouldnt have gone before quarter past ten
8009634 oh little woman youd say anything now youre disagreeable with me wouldnt you
8009635 dont let me be late to night not later than ten oclock my mother gets so upset
8009636 because she says i oughtnt to be out late when i have to get up early
8009637 i was looking at the currant bushes when thinks i to myself theres something very blue is it a bit of sugar bag and there behold you sugar bag three glories of the snow and such beauties but where on earth did they come from
8009638 well thats a marvel now i thought i knew every weed and blade in this garden but havent they done well you see that gooseberry bush just shelters them not nipped not touched
8009639 i guess they come from switzerland where they say they have such lovely things fancy them against the snow but where have they come from they cant have blown here can they
8009640 no i thought id leave it till they might flower
8009641 and now you see i might have missed them and ive never had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life
8009642 you should see the flying scotsman come through at half past six
8009643 but it was williams an my mother cant help but know
8009644 like mother said to me when i was little love begets love
8009645 i hope so because if it were not love might be a very terrible thing
8009646 for she had rheumatism like anything i reckon they treated her rottenly
8009647 we might be going there folk easily might think were going that far
8009648 yes but im not going to let him see it and think i wanted him
8009649 well jimmy my lad how are ter nobbut sick an sadly like why then its a shame my owd lad
8009650 o lord let me not love paul morel keep me from loving him if i ought not to love him
8009651 but lord if it is thy will that i should love him make me love him as christ would who died for the souls of men make me love him splendidly because he is thy son
8009652 if youd care to meet me we could still go together
8009653 i shant meet you anywhere i dont see why you shouldnt keep calling for me but if you wont i dont want to meet you
8009654 we know it let them talk what does it matter what they say
8009655 come here and let me pin them in for you
8009656 a woman ought always to arrange her flowers before her glass
8009657 what is the bride of enderby that the bells are supposed to ring
8009658 its an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning against water i suppose the bride of enderby was drowned in a flood
8009659 yes just like the scotch when they heard the flowers o the forest and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm
8009660 a bell sounds the same whether its rung backwards or forwards
8009661 if you start with the deep bell and ring up to the high one der der der der der der der der
8009662 how much will it be to drive to brook cottage
8009663 its only threepence each and if it were a tramcar
8009664 such rot there isnt a grain of intelligence in it nobody with more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen
8009665 come down lovers lane for a walk with me talk with me
8009666 i can go a walk if i like cant i
8009667 and i should have thought you could get in to supper with the rest
8009668 and if he did anything i shouldnt mind but no he simply cant come away from a game of whist or else he must see a girl home from the skating rink quite proprietously and so cant get home hes a fool
8009669 i dont know that it would make it any better if he did something to make us all ashamed
8009670 because they say a woman always like the youngest best
8009671 she may do but i dont no he wearies me
8009672 id rather he showed some of a mans common sense
8009673 i dont know what made me such a fool i want you to come and fetch me back from here i came with jack bredon yesterday instead of going to work and enlisted he said he was sick of wearing the seat of a stool out and like the idiot you know i am i came away with him
8009674 i have taken the kings shilling but perhaps if you came for me they would let me go back with you
8009675 youre not going to worry your soul out about this do you hear
8009676 youre not going to mount it up to a tragedy so there
8009677 he should get in a cavalry regiment hell have the time of his life and will look an awful swell
8009678 swell swell a mighty swell idea indeed a common soldier
8009679 at any rate a man and not a thing in a red coat
8009680 i shouldnt mind being in a red coat or dark blue that would suit me better if they didnt boss me about too much
8009681 just as he was getting on or might have been getting on at his job a young nuisance here he goes and ruins himself for life what good will he be do you think after this
8009682 lick him into shape lick what marrow there was out of his bones a soldier a common soldier nothing but a body that makes movements when it hears a shout its a fine thing
8009683 and why on earth dont you let him stop its just what he wants
8009684 i hope he may never set foot i my house again
8009685 a fool as runs away for a soldier let im look after issen i sll do no more for im
8009686 said he was perfectly proportioned almost exactly all his measurements were correct he is good looking you know
8009687 hes awfully nice looking but he doesnt fetch the girls like william does he
8009688 no its a different character hes a good deal like his father irresponsible
8009689 what do you think ive got for my pictures mother
8009690 and a first prize for that sketch up at willey farm
8009691 i should have the trouble of dragging you down again
8009692 yes you look very well but i wonder if your son has two first prizes in the castle
8009693 i am driving with father i wish you could come too what time are you free
8009694 hes only one of your good little sops who cant help it
8009695 yes in stature but without a grain of taste i like her for some things is she disagreeable
8009696 well how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that
8009697 why did she marry him then if she was to have revulsions so soon
8009698 and i should have thought she had enough fight in her to match him
8009699 look at her mouth made for passion and the very setback of her throat
8009700 i dont know her skin and the texture of her and her i dont a sort of fierceness somewhere in her i appreciate her as an artist thats all
8009701 eh i dont know perhaps you like her because shes got a grudge against men
8009702 why would you look like some witch or priestess and never like a reveller
8009703 you never laugh laughter you only laugh when something is odd or incongruous and then it almost seems to hurt you
8009704 i wish you could laugh at me just for one minute just for one minute i feel as if it would set something free
8009705 never theres always a kind of intensity when you laugh i could always cry it seems as if it shows up your suffering oh you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate
8009706 i shall be late and then i sll catch it
8009707 i dont see why you should i have plenty of meals there
8009708 oh say no more youve asked her to tea its quite sufficient shell come
8009709 she exults she exults as she carries him off from me
8009710 shes not like an ordinary woman who can leave me my share in him she wants to absorb him she wants to draw him out and absorb him till there is nothing left of him even for himself he will never be a man on his own feet she will suck him up
8009711 im sure ive tried to like her ive tried and tried but i cant
8009712 not when youve gone too far and you feel you cant bear it but your unconscious self always asks it of me and i suppose i want it
8009713 if only you could want me and not want what i can reel off for you
8009714 its not that only they dont like me to they say i care more for you than for them and you understand dont you you know its only friendship
8009715 if tha oppens it again while im weshin me ill mae thy jaw rattle
8009716 thee strip thysen stark nakd to wesh thy flesh i that scullery
8009717 no thad drop down stiff as dead as a door knob wi thy nesh sides
8009718 but theres that much draught i yon scullery as it blows through your ribs like through a five barred gate
8009719 im nowt br a skinned rabbit my bones fair juts out on me
8009720 if he didnt hurtle himself up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could
8009721 thas niver knowed me but what i looked as if i wor goin off in a rapid decline
8009722 and never a man had a better start if it was body that counted you should have seen him as a young man
8009723 the next world wont be half hot enough for you
8009724 should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub o water
8009725 barkers little but hes ten times the man you are
8009726 and he gives me a scrattlin twenty five an his club this week but i know him he thinks because youre earning he neednt keep the house any longer no all he has to do with his money is to guttle it but ill show him
8009727 well it wont make it any better to whittle about it
8009728 i should like to know what youd do if you had it to put up with
8009729 it wont be long you can have my money let him go to hell
8009730 send it to libertys i did it for my mother but i think shed rather have the money
8009731 i shouldnt have expected to see you here to night miriam leivers
8009732 it would ha taken a lot of men to ha brought me down here to night but love laughs at sludge doesnt it postle my duck
8009733 oh lord are you going to spout foreign languages what does it mean miriam
8009734 do you mean love laughs at mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and men friends and lady friends and even at the bloved himself
8009735 isnt it an awful shame to turn you off merely because you didnt pass the exam
8009736 agatha says youre as good as any teacher anywhere it seems to me ridiculous i wonder why you didnt pass
8009737 its a red for danger have you got any of those cigarettes
8009738 this is what comes of the oblivion of love my boy
8009739 youd better be gone when his mother comes in i know why king alfred burned the cakes now i see it postle would fix up a tale about his work making him forget if he thought it would wash if that old woman had come in a bit sooner shed have boxed the brazen things ears who made the oblivion instead of poor alfreds
8009740 i suppose hes left you to settle it between you
8009741 you mean you should do what youre reckoning to do
8009742 well you cant be stuck in the house for ever
8009743 yes the maters precious baking and shell take it to heart however its no good bothering
8009744 the past participle conjugated with avoir agrees with the direct object when it precedes
8009745 it is late but we can read just a little
8009746 behold her singing in the field yon solitary highland lass
8009747 it was a beauteous evening calm and pure and breathing holy quiet like a nun
8009748 it wont upset her so much then as at night
8009749 its only twopence hapenny i can pay you for that
8009750 i found her as white as a sheet sitting here
8009751 hugging those parcels meat and green groceries and a pair of curtains
8009752 well why did you hug them you neednt have done
8009753 yes and i would fetch the meat but how was i to know you were off with miriam instead of being in when my mother came
8009754 then why havent you told me and why havent you seen a doctor
8009755 oh am i and any worse than you with leonard
8009756 that she wouldnt have occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful of bread
8009757 very likely but we know why the bread is spoilt
8009758 youd better go to bed before your father comes in
8009759 and if youre going to have anything to eat youd better get it
8009760 if i wanted you to go to selby on friday night i can imagine the scene
8009761 but youre never too tired to go if she will come for you nay you neither want to eat nor drink then
8009762 yes i should because theres no sense in it is she so fascinating that you must follow her all that way
8009763 it seems to me you like nothing and nobody else theres neither annie nor me nor anyone now for you
8009764 what nonsense mother you know i dont love her i i tell you i dont love her she doesnt even walk with my arm because i dont want her to
8009765 i do like to talk to her i never said i didnt but i dont love her
8009766 why painting and books you dont care about herbert spencer
8009767 but you dont mother you know you dont care whether a pictures decorative or not you dont care what manner it is in
8009768 how do you know i dont care do you ever try me do you ever talk to me about these things to try
8009769 but its not that that matters to you mother you know ts not
8009770 what is it then what is it then that matters to me
8009771 yes i know it well i am old and therefore i may stand aside i have nothing more to do with you you only want me to wait on you the rest is for miriam
8009772 no mother i really dont love her i talk to her but i want to come home to you
8009773 and ive never you know never had a husband not really
8009774 and she exults so in taking you from not like ordinary girls
8009775 now go to bed youll be so tired in the morning
8009776 perhaps im selfish if you want her take her my boy
8009777 nor was that bought for you if you can give me no more than twenty five shillings im sure im not going to buy you pork pie to stuff after youve swilled a bellyful of beer
8009778 tea wont be for a few minutes will you come and look at the daffodils
8009779 it must be rough on the road the wood moans so
8009780 you can see by the clouds its a south west wind that helps me here
8009781 can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to pull the heart out of them why dont you have a bit more restraint or reserve or something
8009782 i would never wheedle at any rate id go straight
8009783 you dont want to love your eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved you arent positive youre negative you absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere
8009784 i dont know is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbits throat one weasel or many rabbits one or the other must go
8009785 how often have we agreed for friendship and yet it neither stops there nor gets anywhere else
8009786 i can only give all im capable a flaw in my make up the thing overbalances to one side i hate a toppling balance let us have done
8009787 all in myself it only comes out just now were always like this towards easter time
8009788 it is such a sunny day i was just going down the fields for the first time this year
8009789 they seem such a sign of spring and so hopeful
8009790 they are quite hot i think we frightened her off them
8009791 do you think if i didnt come up so much you might get to like somebody else another man
8009792 but i dont know any other men why do you ask
8009793 because they say ive no right to come up like this without we mean to marry
8009794 mother and the others they say at this rate everybody will consider me engaged and i ought to consider myself so because its not fair to you and ive tried to find out and i dont think i love you as a man ought to love his wife what do you think about it
8009795 do you think we love each other enough to marry
8009796 that you with your intensity in things might have given me more than i could ever make up to you and even now if you think it be engaged
8009797 with me i dont think one person would ever monopolize me be everything to me i think never
8009798 it was for your sake she spoke this time she only said if i was going on i ought to consider myself engaged
8009799 and if i ask you to come down any time you wont stop away will you
8009800 i suppose id better drop french i was just beginning to get on with it but i suppose i can go on alone
8009801 well and there are sunday nights i shant stop coming to chapel because i enjoy it and its all the social life i get but youve no need to come home with me i can go alone
8009802 but if i ask edgar hell always come with us and then they can say nothing
8009803 and you wont think about it and let it trouble you will you
8009804 a man gets across his bicycle and goes to work and does all sorts of things but a woman broods
8009805 miriam you shouldnt have let him sit out of doors do you think youve taken cold paul
8009806 a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come
8009807 you said youd bring me that letter from the man at libertys have you remembered
8009808 do it whether or not and is she any more agreeable
8009809 clara only came with father and not been here very long
8009810 i went in for a few minutes before the train came
8009811 its not heaven she wants to her fair share on earth
8009812 i thought she was warm and awfully nice only too frail
8009813 and im sure shed do them well just as i wouldnt mind blacking her boots if she wanted me to
8009814 i think ill go and see edgar is he on the land
8009815 hes gone for a load of coal he should be back directly
8009816 if she looks at a man she says haughtily nevermore and if she looks at herself in the looking glass she says disdainfully nevermore and if she thinks back she says it in disgust and if she looks forward she says it cynically
8009817 i think a voice needs training before the singing is anything
8009818 you might as well insist on having peoples voices trained before you allowed them to talk
8009819 really people sing for their own pleasure as a rule
8009820 then the other people should have flaps to their ears
8009821 youll find youre always tumbling over the things youve put behind you
8009822 singing with your maids at your broidery i would carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope i would have w s p u emblazoned on my shield beneath a woman rampant
8009823 that you would much rather fight for a woman than let her fight for herself
8009824 i would when she fights for herself she seems like a dog before a looking glass gone into a mad fury with its own shadow
8009825 be good sweet maid and just let me be clever
8009826 that his young beases as broke that bottom fence three days an runnin
8009827 no thanks but we should like to go by the pond
8009828 are you coming in do come in mr i didnt catch it
8009829 no we wont come in but we should like to go by the mill pond
8009830 because if you do you might come and fish any time
8009831 we scarcely see a soul from weeks end to weeks end i should be thankful
8009832 come when you like my brother will be awfully pleased to talk with you he is so quiet because there is no one to talk to do come and swim
8009833 miss limb was just saying we could come when we liked
8009834 whats a matter with her is she going dotty with being too lonely
8009835 its not the right sort of life for her i think its cruel to bury her there i really ought to go and see her more but she upsets me
8009836 she makes me feel sorry for her yes and she bothers me
8009837 they dont die any quicker in water than on their roots and besides they look nice in a bowl they look jolly and you only call a thing a corpse because it looks corpse like
8009838 it isnt one to me a dead flower isnt a corpse of a flower
8009839 and even so what right have you to pull them
8009840 because i like them and want them and theres plenty of them
8009841 yes why not im sure theyd smell nice in your room in nottingham
8009842 and i should have the pleasure of watching them die
8009843 but then it does not matter if they do die
8009844 if you treat them with reverence you dont do them any harm it is the spirit you pluck them in that matters
8009845 but no you get em because you want em and thats all
8009846 sturdy and lusty like little trees and like boys with fat legs
8009847 ashes to ashes and dust to dust if the lord wont have you the devil must
8009848 it makes me think of the wild men of the woods how terrified they would be when they got breast to breast with the open space
8009849 i wonder which was more frightened among old tribes those bursting out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light or those from the open tiptoeing into the forests
8009850 yes you do feel like one of the open space sort trying to force yourself into the dark dont you
8009851 look mother how big she is above the town think there are streets and streets below her she looks bigger than the city altogether
8009852 i dont like it i really dont just think of your money wasted
8009853 you forget im a fellow taking his girl for an outing
8009854 i want people to think were awful swells so look ikey
8009855 ha thats the jews house now do you remember that lecture paul
8009856 my heart is only a bit old one must expect it
8009857 now this is better than i thought it could be
8009858 do you think theyd have the damned cheek to send us away
8009859 why cant a man have a young mother what is she old for
8009860 and why wasnt i the oldest son look they say the young ones have the advantage but look they had the young mother you should have had me for your eldest son
8009861 come to consider youre as much to blame as me
8009862 why cant you walk why cant you come with me to places
8009863 i could have run up that hill a good deal better than you
8009864 im a bit old and youll have to put up with it thats all
8009865 i dont think so i think they do lace work
8009866 i dont know that shes charming mother but shes nice and she seems straight you know not a bit deep not a bit
8009867 because i dont know a sort of defiant way shes got a sort of angry way
8009868 yes yes a winder when you have to pour your own tea out an nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and sup it up it somehow takes a the taste out of it
8009869 annies a bit of a spendthrift shes saved no more than eleven pounds and i know lad you havent had much chance
8009870 no my lad i know i was only wishing i had and take away five pounds for the wedding and things it leaves twenty nine pounds you wont do much on that
8009871 we must all do the best we can for it lad
8009872 youre got a decent place if a man had needed me id have married him on his last weeks wages she may find it a bit hard to start humbly young girls are like that they look forward to the fine home they think theyll have but i had expensive furniture its not everything
8009873 i sll trust her to you my lad and hold you responsible for her
8009874 im not sorry shes married but it seems strange that she should go from me it even seems to me hard that she can prefer to go with her leonard thats how mothers are i know its silly
8009875 but you can trust him to be good to her
8009876 yes yes they say hes not good enough for her but i say if a man is genuine as he is and a girl is fond of him then it should be all right hes as good as she
8009877 i would never have let a daughter of mine marry a man i didnt feel to be genuine through and through and yet theres a gap now shes gone
8009878 ay they all say that my lad youve not met the one yet only wait a year or two
8009879 but i shant marry mother i shall live with you and well have a servant
8009880 ay my lad its easy to talk well see when the time comes
8009881 i shouldnt like to think of you going through your life without anybody to care for you and do no
8009882 it would be hard and very hard its as they say
8009883 a sons my son till he takes him a wife but my daughters my daughter the whole of her life
8009884 and you think id let a wife take me from you
8009885 well you wouldnt ask her to marry your mother as well as you
8009886 she could do what she liked she wouldnt have to interfere
8009887 i never will see ill never marry while ive got you i wont
8009888 but i shouldnt like to leave you with nobody my boy
8009889 youre not going to leave me what are you fifty three ill give you till seventy five there you are im fat and forty four then ill marry a staid body see
8009890 and well have a pretty house you and me and a servant and itll be just all right i sll perhaps be rich with my painting
8009891 and then you sll have a pony carriage see yourself a little queen victoria trotting round
8009892 nay tha doesna ill gie thee a smoke kiss if ters a mind
8009893 i reckon a crow is religious when it sails across the sky but it only does it because it feels itself carried to where its going not because it thinks it is being eternal
8009894 i dont believe god knows such a lot about himself
8009895 god doesnt know things he is things and im sure hes not soulful
8009896 may i speak of our old worn love this last time
8009897 ought i to send this letter i doubt it but there it is best to understand au revoir
8009898 our intimacy would have been all beautiful but for one little mistake
8009899 i am glad you answered you are so calm and natural you put me to shame what a ranter i am we are often out of sympathy but in fundamentals we may always be together i think
8009900 i must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and drawing many a sketch is dedicated to you i do look forward to your criticisms which to my shame and glory are always grand appreciations it is a lovely joke that au revoir
8009901 no my son not so much but i expected a good deal
8009902 twenty guineas mother thats just what you wanted to buy arthur out now you neednt borrow any itll just do
8009903 they tell me pauls got first prize for his picture and sold it to lord henry bentley for fifty pound
8009904 i said i wor sure it wor a lie but they said thad told fred hodgkisson
8009905 i dont misdoubt it but twenty guineas for a bit of a paintin as he knocked off in an hour or two
8009906 that i couldnt tell you when the picture is sent home i suppose
8009907 yes an that other lad ud a done as much if they hadna ha killed im
8009908 that i know cost four pounds ten and which hed only worn three times
8009909 yes i think it would fit you at least the coat the trousers would want shortening
8009910 its beautiful stuff i never could find in my heart to let your father wear the trousers and very glad i am now
8009911 if they want to know me and they say they do then they want to know you because you are quite as clever as i am
8009912 i dont want to belong to the well to do middle class i like my common people best i belong to the common people
8009913 but if anyone else said so my son wouldnt you be in a tear you know you consider yourself equal to any gentleman
8009914 not in my class or my education or my manners but in myself i am
8009915 very well then then why talk about the common people
8009916 because the difference between people isnt in their class but in themselves only from the middle classes one gets ideas and from the common people life itself warmth you feel their hates and loves
8009917 its all very well my boy but then why dont you go and talk to your fathers pals
8009918 not at all theyre the common people after all whom do you mix with now among the common people those that exchange ideas like the middle classes the rest dont interest you
8009919 i dont believe theres a jot more life from miriam than you could get from any educated girl say miss moreton it is you who are snobbish about class
8009920 all your cleverness your breaking away from old things and taking life in your own hands doesnt seem to bring you much happiness
8009921 its nothing to me how am i to be happy
8009922 thats for you to judge my lad but if you could meet some good woman who would make you happy and you began to think of settling your life when you have the means so that you could work without all this fretting it would be much better for you
8009923 thats a womans whole doctrine for life ease of soul and physical comfort and i do despise it
8009924 yes i dont care about its divinity but damn your happiness so long as lifes full it doesnt matter whether its happy or not im afraid your happiness would bore me
8009925 and you ought to be happy you ought to try to be happy to live to be happy how could i bear to think your life wouldnt be a happy one
8009926 your owns been bad enough mater but it hasnt left you so much worse off than the folk whove been happier i reckon youve done well and i am the same arent i well enough off
8009927 youre not my son battle battle and suffer its about all you do as far as i can see
8009928 it isnt and one ought to be happy one ought
8009929 so long as you dont feel lifes paltry and a miserable business the rest doesnt matter happiness or unhappiness
8009930 eh my dear say rather you want me to live
8009931 well my lad you did it yourself now you must make the best of it
8009932 if youre coming in you wont have to mind the work
8009933 i know were about blocked up but sit you down
8009934 its only a thick skin ive got that doesnt show the blood through
8009935 and light yourself a cigarette so long as you dont set the house on fire
8009936 i sll be glad to smell a bit of smoke in th ouse again a house o women is as dead as a house wi no fire to my thinkin im not a spider as likes a corner to myself i like a man about if hes only something to snap at
8009937 ay well and i can remember when thomas jordan used to ask me for one of my toffies
8009938 sometimes he did sometimes he was latterly for hes the sort that takes all and gives naught he is or used to be
8009939 shes very nice but shes a bit too much above this world to suit my fancy

8009951 you only say that because youre too proud to own up what you want and cant get
8009952 i know you think youre terrific great shakes and that you live under the eternal insult of working in a factory
8009953 a sort of waiting whatever i see you doing youre not really there you are waiting like penelope when she did her weaving
8009954 that doesnt matter so long as it pleases me here i say you seem to forget im your boss it just occurs to me

8009968 you feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles and have a handful of them
8009969 yes it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us proportionately the trees are much more significant
8009970 to think the town goes no farther it is only a little sore upon the country yet
8009971 its only temporary this is the crude clumsy make shift weve practised on till we find out what the idea is the town will come all right
8009972 hm thats snatching back with the left hand what you gave with the right and no mistake
8009973 i know you were brooding something special i can see the stamp of it on your face yet
8009974 they have been plotting something for a week now and to day they seem particularly full of it all alike they insult me with their secrecy
8009975 if they did not thrust it into my face the fact that they have a secret
8009976 but they might refrain from glorying in them and making me feel more out of it than ever it is it is almost unbearable
8009977 its my birthday and theyve bought me a fine lot of paints all the girls
8009978 she is wanting somebody to take her hands for all she is so contemptuous of us

8009986 but why did you leave him was he horrid to you
8009987 he he sort of degraded me he wanted to bully me because he hadnt got me and then i felt as if i wanted to run as if i was fastened and bound up and he seemed dirty
8009988 and then he seemed as if he couldnt get at me really and then he got brutal he was brutal
8009989 but did you were you ever did you ever give him a chance
8009990 and i suppose he couldnt make himself mean everything to you
