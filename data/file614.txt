6140014 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
6140015 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter

6140029 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6140030 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6140031 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6140032 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6140033 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6140034 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6140035 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6140036 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6140037 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6140038 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6140039 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt

6140041 the o finally ready to bring website into the early 2000s
6140042 bye and bye when the morning comes all the saints of god are gathered home we will tell the story how weve overcome we will understand it better bye and bye
6140043 i tell you friends therell be a price to pay for all these people who are throwing away their money on these gambling tables while their little children go barefoot
6140044 i want to vote for somebody thats going to try to put this country on its feet with its own energy
6140045 even though most of us feel the pain of higher gasoline and energy prices colorados one of those states that has a fairly significant energy industry
6140046 im not exactly all excited about the democrats but theyve got my vote this time
6140047 in the last few months notably the state has really been sort of going counter to the rest of the country
6140048 its just making it tougher and more expensive for me
6140049 im sure there are other places like this but its almost a part of me
6140050 but the economics are such that im almost certain that i will have to look elsewhere for work
6140051 its not enough to provide jobs and full time good jobs for everybody
6140052 i dont believe that any president is going to have that immediate an impact on the economy
6140053 we are a completely committed recreational state and by and large we recreate with gas
6140054 we load up the suv and go to the mountains
6140055 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6140056 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6140057 so were hopeful that that the international tournament will become opportune for them as well when we first raised it with them it was met with a great deal of interest that needs to drill down to a yes
6140058 at the moment it looks as though we have seven australian teams and formal invitations have gone out this week to all of the new zealand national league teams
6140059 but he was playing solid he waited for his opportunities and when they came along he made birdies he was always in control of his game

6140061 the mist or fog in the air on an oppressively humid night
6140062 i normally arrive at the warm up area an hour before that gives me time to have my last quiet time i zone out i lie down on the massage table put my headphones on close my eyes and basically am a zombie for 50 minutes
6140063 weve developed a pattern at the end of my warm up just before i go to the call room where hell pray for me willis said
6140064 thanked god for everything that had built for this moment we just wanted to enjoy it we just offered this race back up to him and then i went off to the call room
6140065 maximise energy for the start of my race not 10 minutes before
6140066 stay off the rail ringing in his ears cruised through the first two laps in eighth place as the kenyans
6140067 feeling pretty flat after a hard heat and semi final in the broiling beijing heat
6140068 in cruise control down the back straight then wound it up with 120m to go
6140069 come back to me but he knew he was sprinting for bronze not gold ramzi won that from kiprop
6140070 i eked out that last inch to dip him over the line i heard him scream in despair 23sec separated them
6140071 that would have been absolutely devastating if id got that close and just missed out
6140072 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6140073 even with the growth in this market 90 percent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 percent
6140074 we want to reach out to people who dont have a smartphone not people who already love rim
6140075 going forward for premium fully featured devices wi fi is a requirement
6140076 businesses want the control and savings that windows mobile affords in an innovative and elegant package that keeps their users happy thats where palm comes in
6140077 everything about treo pro from the hardware design to the packaging and accessories embodies the elegant and simplified end to end experience that our customers expect from palm
6140078 im really happy with treo pro its a technology leap from a device design and capability standpoint enhancing palms presence in the windows mobile realm
6140079 its cleverly designed for windows mobile with a large touch screen wi fi bluetooth and all the productivity applications for windows mobile 6 in a much thinner design
6140080 windows mobile is delivering mobile solutions that help businesses address the changing competitive landscape
6140081 the treo pro smartphone brings together a powerful combination of palms feature innovations and windows mobile 6 1 providing access to the information people need when away from the office
6140082 challenging some of the fundamental tenets of the existing global economic system
6140083 no to the construction of the essar steel mill and its associated port
6140084 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6140085 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6140086 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt looked that easy
6140087 this is the girl i am going to marry if she gives me a chance
6140088 i was trying to win gold but the main focus was not coming away with nothing
6140089 there was a lot of pumping going down and no time to breathe throughout the race i was just destroyed at the end
6140090 thankfully the guys behind me werent able to catch me i thought they were going to at one stage but i held on
6140091 i was stressing the whole race i was never confident in sailing conditions like today anything could happen
6140092 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that
6140093 all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6140094 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6140095 in the end i decided to let the israeli guy go and concentrate on covering the french and british guys
6140096 obviously a very bright boy as hes computing a lot as he goes along
6140097 i had followed windsurfing through barbara kendall and aaron mcintosh but my plan had been to go laser sailing i guess it was a push into the sport but not in a pushy way i just loved it straight away its a really fantastic sport
6140098 this has gone as well as it could have gone but i dont know if ill be carrying on i do love what i do but id really like to go to university to study law at some stage and my nature is to be all or nothing so if i did that id want to give it 100 per cent
6140099 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to think about everything
6140100 he managed to get on to the water they smuggled him on to a press boat which was pretty cool
6140101 you have to be a bit psycho to be the best at this sport and he is i mean psycho in a nice way hes intensely focused
6140102 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
6140103 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
6140104 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
6140105 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
6140106 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
6140107 the advice from the security advisers is that the status quo remains
6140108 if anything musharrafs departure is a step in the right direction
6140109 the only tournament i want is with the best teams and the best players
6140110 of course people have fears and people have concerns and rightly so because there are things happening in pakistan
6140111 either you send your best teams or you decide that the advice tells you differently
6140112 it looks like they hired a 14 year old with no design skills and told them to make something that looks like apple
6140113 necesitamos salas de teatro aqu en la capital tenemos muy pocas desde hace tiempo tengo en carpeta un proyecto de teatro municipal con idea de ver si motivaba a los ayuntamientos a que cada uno construya un teatro municipal hay que pensar que los grupos no se pueden trasladar hacia la capital yo que recorro el pa s con este trabajo y trabajo en canchas estadios y donde sea creo que es hora de que el pa s tenga m s salas en las provincias
6140114 hacer un censo art stico en las provincias para descubrir valores y luego que puedan ser aprovechados
6140115 est bamos muy esperanzados en que este a o por fin tendr amos nuestra ley nacional de cine pero no ha sucedido as no s ni de qui n es la culpa pero realmente es una pena que no hayamos podido ya tener esta ley aprobada cuando nos a ayudar tanto y aportar muchos frutos
6140116 esto podr a costarnos quiz s dos a os m s y eso es lo que no quer amos no se saben las razones pero ahora hay que esperar
6140117 what do you need to be the best concentration discipline most of all a dream
6140118 it is an honour to know that our game is enjoyed by so many people from different backgrounds
6140119 from top professional players to football enthusiasts and kids who just want a kickabout in the streets its appeal is widening all the time the new become a legend and legends modes are designed to convey the pressure and pace a real pro experiences with players working as part of a strong side and working to prove their merit as a player i feel great and motivated when people enjoy our games and feel the new modes will open up new ways to enjoy pes
6140120 we have pulled out all the stops to make pes 2009 a landmark in footballing games
6140121 from the most basic controls through to the wide ranging additions to game modes such as become a legend all new visuals sound and the edit mode seabass and his team have strived to cram as much as they can into the new game and with more online announcements to follow there is every reason to believe that pes 2009 is the football game everyone has been waiting for
6140122 la vita non mai troppo lunga per imparare a lasciarla

6140125 will be in a significantly stronger financial position and will have the resources to develop a strong international market presence
6140126 we sense an incredible level of support but the key thing is people havent got the information yet
6140127 were in the middle of negotiations were trying to come up with an arrangement that suits both of us
6140128 i think you may have some chaos in the industry if this thing doesnt go through because the alternatives not very palatable for farmers
6140129 theres a lot more work to be done yet but the response were getting from farmers when they front up and understand the answers to the valid issues theyve got has been very supportive
6140130 its not as glamourous as people think it has its ups and downs there can be a lot of intrusion into your private life but i want to be known for my music
6140131 its not partying all the time sometimes when i get the chance i am too tired to party people dont see the work that goes in to touring but its definitely worth it
6140132 i find that sort of thing funny that was the funniest thing when someone told me i was supposed to be dating will
6140133 he is like my brother i dont know when the last time i saw him was he has been on tour
6140134 its pretty likely i will be going back to europe next year nothings signed or sealed yet but its looking pretty promising said the 27 year old
6140135 its something i really want to do so im really excited it will take me back in the big league
6140136 i stumbled on all that pro stuff when i was pretty young age he recalled yesterday
6140137 i was very green when i went to europe all by myself and it wasnt easy there were a lot of pressure and stresses involved but things have changed a lot
6140138 i love the track the double medal winner said that the young members of his track team could soon become a target for the professional teams but hoped that bike nz could keep them in new zealand
6140139 all the guys up here are so talented it wont be long before the word is out that these guys have got engines
6140140 the record speaks for itself in addition to retaliatory actions despite numerous applications made no approvals for demonstrations have been reported
6140141 we will take the time to look at it after this press briefing
6140142 however the games here clearly are focusing on sport we are aware of wider issues but the ioc took a decision to come to beijing because opening the door and engaging is the way forward
6140143 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
6140144 ive got a little tally thats been locked away in the back of my mind and were kind of starting to get there
6140145 its been a great effort across a broad range of sports and its up there where we expected
6140146 we had 17 athletes in top three in the world coming in to this and we hoped a significant number of those could convert that to medals and were getting to the point where a significant number are doing that
6140147 even those who havent got a medal have delivered courageous performances
6140148 what a match our bowling and fielding always keeps us in the hunt if only we had another 2 consistent batsmen other than sanga mahela and sanath to replace
6140149 badri should have been selected in the indian team 2 years back itself he is a prime example of selectors ignoring genuine talent and performance in domestic and a tours lesser batsmen got preference repeatedly over him perhaps the south zone selector in the selection panel has got something personal against him even for this series if he hadnt shouted after finally being fed up openly against selectors he wouldnt have got selected
6140150 man is not born to solve the problems of the universe but to find out what he has to do
6140151 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in
6140152 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6140153 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6140154 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6140155 what nick willis has done is tremendous for new zealand tremendous for the spirit of new zealand
6140156 it is not about money it is about dedication and hard work that finish of his down the straight was a result of all the work no one sees all the time on the hills that is what counts
6140157 new zealanders can compete with the africans they are no different than we are apart from perhaps being a bit slighter in build
6140158 they try to run from the front but once they get behind they can be beaten you just have to believe that
6140159 look at the aussies and how everyone talks about their sports institutes well where were the aussies in the 1500m
6140160 arthur lydiard always said the africans are beatable you just cant beat hard work and a lot of people still believe in the lydiard principles some people maybe think they are old fashioned but it is a simple recipe
6140161 at the olympics you get just one chance in four years and very rarely do you get a second one you have to take that opportunity when it is there
6140162 some athletes run the race before they get to the track its all about coping with pressure
6140163 im still buzzing and i look forward to watching the race again
6140164 i cannot say i am surprised given the controversy that was always going to surround a deal of this kind
6140165 whenever the council moves quickly with a purchase of 17m it is never a surprise that people will want the process checked out
6140166 the legislation we work under recognises that there will be times when council needs to make an urgent decision
6140167 it will be no bad thing for it to get external scrutiny
6140168 people need to have confidence we have acted in a correct way
6140169 there is huge public outrage and concern at how this happened and it is important that an external examination takes place
6140170 soaked up and ate up anything he could read on new zealands athletics past
6140171 ive read no bugles no drums by peter snell and the john walker book and kiwis can fly that chronicled john walkers dick quaxs and rod dixons european tours and ive just been given the new jack lovelock book by the editor
6140172 i love to learn as much as i can about he sport im both a student an athlete myself and a fan willis was touched to get messages from rogers between his races in beijing and was buoyed to read walker felt he had the speed and strength to win and had put 20 on him at the tab
6140173 in our range of abilities right from the 800 through to the 5000m
6140174 our engines are very similarly aligned he was a bit bigger than me but we are similar in terms of times and performances
6140175 apart from lord of the rings and the flight of the conchords sport catapults new zealand onto the global stage
6140176 i got up looked out my back window and it was engulfed it scared me because i thought it might be the back of my house
6140177 the girls were screaming that their father was still inside but when i went in i couldnt even get up to the second loor where he was because of the smoke
6140178 and that was one of the hardest things i ever did was to tell them i couldnt help them
6140179 you know you get the things in the mail about supporting your fire department i dont know what wed do without them because they know just what theyre doing
6140180 what the fuck are you talking about i can never land a throw
6140181 what the fuck are you talking about i can never land a throw
6140182 we needed a central depository in which to store editing knowledge every time we trained a new associate editor we had to teach him or her the style guide and forward multiple emails from years past
6140183 consistent editing is essential to satisfying our customer base we work on tight deadlines and multiple editors may work on different documents submitted by the same client there is not enough time to share information over a webinar
6140184 the information we share on the wiki is not a secret these are accepted standards in the writing and editing industry
6140185 we really strive to remove the technology barrier english is difficult enough without adding the complexity of software
6140186 what the fuck are you talking about i can never land a throw
6140187 what the fuck are you talking about i can never land a throw
6140188 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
6140189 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
6140190 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
6140191 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6140192 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6140193 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6140194 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6140195 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
6140196 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6140197 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6140198 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6140199 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6140200 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6140201 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
6140202 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
6140203 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
6140204 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
6140205 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
6140206 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god

6140242 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6140243 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
6140244 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
6140245 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6140246 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6140247 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6140248 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6140249 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6140250 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

6140298 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6140299 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6140300 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits

6140321 while it is good not to have that burden of expectation on your shoulder i think we can give even more provided we get better facilities
6140322 i thought ill do whatever it takes and the end result is the medal is mine its an unforgettable moment in my life and it seems im living in a dream
6140323 im sorry i could not win the medal but i tried my best
6140324 we know that it takes time to build a non homophobic tolerant and inclusive society
6140325 major european cities are mainstreaming equality by holding numerous public events including lgbt prides
6140326 unfortunately it is not a practice in two main lithuanian cities which refuse to embrace such an important anti discrimination information campaign
6140327 furthermore the mayors of vilnius and kaunas are sending a clear message that lgbt people are still not welcome in their diverse communities and are creating some kind of 21st century apartheid
6140328 we regret that the european commission had to agree on a compromise of a private supermarket territory
6140329 the resistance and disrespect towards this legislation and these principles by the lithuanian mayors is yet another proof that the commission needs to take an uncompromising leading role and to ensure that all eu member states and their authorities including cities are compliant with and respectful of eu principles and its laws

6140340 blackwater has a much better idea of what an effective peace keeping mission would look like than western governments

6140342 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6140343 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6140344 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6140345 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6140346 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6140347 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6140348 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6140349 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6140350 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6140351 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6140352 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6140353 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6140354 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6140355 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6140356 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6140357 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto
6140358 i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible

6140364 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6140365 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6140366 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6140367 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6140368 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6140369 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6140370 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting this is finally good news for afghanistan
6140371 i represent a very strong team people who would be of my age in about four years time would probably not get into a team of such high quality
6140372 i probably would not be at the olympic games representing russia and i dont want to represent any other country
6140373 which in the russian school system is not really what i wanted
6140374 its a pass its barely a pass even though i fought in a manner which was not at the top quality nonetheless my character and my psychological makeup brought me victory

6140463 it was from 30 feet and i hit it way too hard and three putted
6140464 they have different strengths and will use different strategies lashawn will run a personal best jeremy will win but it will be a good race
6140465 no problem im very calm ill win the gold medal
6140466 flat out the discovery of this years un certain regard section
6140467 lucky life isnt one long string of horrors and there are moments of peace and pleasure as i lie in between the blows
6140468 flat out the discovery of this years un certain regard section
6140469 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6140470 often many gold medallists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6140471 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities
6140472 there is a complete dearth of facilities here compared with somewhere like
6140473 i think the lack of facilities here just leads to kids hanging about on the streets with nowhere to go
6140474 in terms of olympic medals the thing that probably gets you furthest is spending and focusing resources on athletes who have come forward who are doing well
6140475 the body arrives at the lusaka international airport from paris on august 24 at 9 00 am 07h00 gmt
6140476 you pay x dollars per session and you can only use it at a few locations
6140477 the explosion of free sites is really driving the market
6140478 wi fi grows like a weed it shows up in areas you never expect
6140479 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband
6140480 this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase
6140481 hotspot owners are still charging if they control a prime location like airports where there is no alternative
6140482 it is hard for them to just walk away from that revenue stream even if it will decline
6140483 how come a whole building caught fire in an hour where are the fire alarms and where are the sprinklers
6140484 but in 1998 we managed to control the fire in the room it erupted in
6140485 we heard air conditioners blowing up and wooden shutters caught fire and flew in the air
6140486 we brought our extinguishers to be ready in case of the fire reached our building
6140487 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble
6140488 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6140489 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6140490 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6140491 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6140492 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6140493 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6140494 or button is too far to the right of the shift key and thats the only shift key i use
6140495 in diesem bereich bewegt sich auch in der regel das gewicht eines schulranzens

6140499 wir schauten ob von der seite gesehen kn chel schulter und ohr auf einer linie lagen der sogenannten lotlinie diese haltungsanalyse zeigt ob muskelkraft und muskelsteuerung ausreichen um den k rper aufzurichten und in dieser position zu halten

6140501 einige unserer spr sslinge haben viel zu schwach ausgebildete muskeln und k nnen dadurch nat rlich nicht das gewicht eines derart schweren ranzens tragen
6140502 in general asian americans are not likely to talk about their psychological problems
6140503 community practitioners notice that asian americans are less likely to self disclose their personal problems
6140504 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6140505 we can only speculate that it may be that a lot of these women are dedicated to family and they live long lives
6140506 without that kind of extended family older women may be more likely to commit suicide
6140507 although we dont have good statistics yet we believe that many asian american students are prone to feeling depressed over a lack of achievement
6140508 passed go making monopoly the most played board game ever the company adds
6140509 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6140510 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6140511 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6140512 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6140513 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6140514 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6140515 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6140516 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6140517 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal it is not significant and it needs to increase
6140518 whether that is the beginning of a true withdrawal or some sort of token effort
6140519 we are ready to go through war with the great power to protect the sudanese citizen
6140520 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
6140521 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
6140522 there is no point in signing an agreement at this point in time
6140523 we will review the agreement in light of the comments given by the supreme court justices and in the light of what is happening in mindanao
6140524 watering down the agreement will mean going back to zero
6140525 this could be a beginning of war if not properly handled
6140526 to partner with parents as we connect and grow on gods great adventure
6140527 my mom told me not to lead you on this weekend whats that supposed to mean
6140528 there are years that ask questions and years that answer
6140529 it is easy to be independent when youve got money but to be independent when you havent got a thing thats the lords test
6140530 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart amp try to love the questions themselves
6140531 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6140532 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6140533 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6140534 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
6140535 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
6140536 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
6140537 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
6140538 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
6140539 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
6140540 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
6140541 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
6140542 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
6140543 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
6140544 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
6140545 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
6140546 i love it when you can go about your daily business with the knowledge that you have a little secret of your own on underneath
6140547 lingerie shouldnt be something you just put on for your lover you should do it for you
6140548 there are many f1 drivers who are waiting for a win and there are f1 drivers like lewis that they came with very good package doing very good job and they manage to win straightaway so im pretty happy with what i have achieved but of course you always want more
6140549 to be honest i will be not disappointed if i do not become world champion because i think all drivers would like to be world champion but only one is winning and it is not only depending on myself
6140550 for me the most important thing is to be happy of what im doing because i can be quite negative to myself of what im doing how im driving
6140551 there are lots of drivers who arrive in f1 and you know that theyre good but they dont have theyre sort of missing an ingredient with some drivers but i think hes got that extra ingredient
6140552 id be very surprised if he wasnt on the shopping list of the top teams
6140553 that time was the best time of my life i enjoyed what i was doing i was really on it i was having a lot of fun
6140554 i was not really at that time i was not realizing what i had achieved
6140555 thats why privately im not going to poland unfortunately i say unfortunately because in the end its my home and i miss to be honest this kind of freedom that i had five years ago
6140556 last time i went jogging in poland i couldnt run for five minutes without somebody who was asking me something or stopping me
6140557 its nice but in the end when im at home i have some job to do which i need quiet atmosphere to do
6140558 i think its good its also what you do on the weekend to relax at the track and stop thinking
6140559 there comes a point where drivers want to be in f1 to win they will demand to have the equipment to do that
6140560 i think bmw have a strategy which is ambitious but at the moment they are not quite in the front line of formula one
6140561 i understand another rumor is flying out there there was no discussion of that internally or externally none
6140562 dont know where it ends it doesnt matter now as long as were as one
6140563 to wit that the human being like the immortals naturally places sexual intercourse far and away above all other joys yet he has left it out of his heaven the very thought of it opportunity sets him wild in this state he will risk life reputation everything even his queer heaven itself to make good that opportunity and ride it to the overwhelming climax from youth to middle age all men and all women prize copulation above all other pleasures combined yet it is actually as i have said it is not in their heaven prayer takes its place
6140564 fannie mae executive vice president thomas a lund said the company pursued the purchase of subprime loans in 2006 and 2007 at the request of lenders who wanted fannie mae to take the loans off their books
6140565 the company recognized the already weak performance of subprime loans but predicted that they would get better in 2007
6140566 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
6140567 in 2006 and early 2007 the industry many analysts and market observers were generally not predicting a downturn in the housing and credit markets to the magnitude of what has since emerged and outlooks for particular market segments at that time varied significantly
6140568 was more conservative in its approach and the loans have continued to perform better
6140569 i hope you had a fantastic time at the holiday party i sure did and my feet still hurt thank you for making the party a blowout
6140570 a time when we began to put a difficult past behind us and also to build for the future
6140571 we engaged in the subprime market for the first time closing deals to guarantee and securitize subprime loans with help from the new facility that allows us to sell off the riskiest layers
6140572 approached its expansion of this business cognizant of the relatively weak credit performance of recent subprime originations which were affected by issues relating to underwriting quality home price de appreciation and risk layering
6140573 however management expects improvement in the quality and credit performance of subprime mortgages originated this year
6140574 by the most severe decline in home prices since the great depression
6140575 where home prices have fallen further and faster than in the rest of the nation
6140576 1 13 percentage points premium over the rate the federal government pays for comparable borrowing
6140577 almost half the demand of three months ago and about two thirds of asias usual purchases
6140578 is the single most important factor to their ability to remain liquid
6140579 this whole backstop mechanism was set up so the actual need for it could be avoided
6140580 treasury is monitoring market developments vigilantly we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests
6140581 continues to have strong access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
6140582 the conditions dont seem to be turning into a good environment
6140583 it hasnt restored any faith it just highlighted their problems
6140584 the market has come to accept the fact that the government has got to do something
6140585 while the plan was extraordinarily aggressive it seems that the market is looking for something even more explicit and more guidance about what form that will take
6140586 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering
6140587 they will want as much assurance as they can possibly get
6140588 analyze and understand these authorities should circumstances ever warrant their use
6140589 the better step would have been to have legislation that would have permitted them to be taken over immediately
6140590 the worry is not that they wont get their money back but that negative headlines will continue and it will be hard for them to explain why they are adding to their positions at this time
6140591 the market dodged the bullet today but from now on every auction is going to be a cliffhanger
6140592 it was a large offering and that it was oversubscribed points to the fact that our liquidity position and access to the worlds capital markets remains very strong
6140593 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6140594 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6140595 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what us treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
6140596 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6140597 what will happen to freddie mac and fannie mae preferred shareholders
6140598 there are concerns about financials and the fact that they are definitely not out of the woods yet
6140599 the worst is yet to come in the u s
6140600 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6140601 we expect the quarter will again be characterized by mark to market valuation adjustments in mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations holdings as well as ineffective hedge performance
6140602 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets
6140603 in addition though we are also seeing results being negatively impacted by slower levels of client activity and expenses and fines from auction rate securities
6140604 we believe the management wants to leave its mortgage troubles behind and restore confidence which it can best accomplish by reducing its higher risk credit exposure
6140605 the state must remain vigilant going forward because of the continued possibility of failed auctions
6140606 we heeded the negative signals that were in the market
6140607 we see continued pressure on arcs and expect further rate deterioration
6140608 issuers are reviewing their current exposure and considering whether the time may be right to exit the ars market for another mode with less volatility or risk
6140609 should conditions change jpmorgan is available and stands ready to assist the state
6140610 the drop is good news because what is sorely needed in the housing market is a decrease in supply not an increase
6140611 we look for the single family category to decline by another 15 to 20 before reaching a trough later this year or early next
6140612 its like catching a falling knife and im not real interested in that
6140613 i dont think every bank out there is too big to fail
6140614 more diversified they have more stable deposit bases and larger capital bases theyre more stable and under the direct influence of the fed
6140615 everythings still negative to me when i look at the fundamentals of where housing prices are going to go
6140616 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms
6140617 ive been at national city for 30 years and a month and for 29 of those weve seen nothing like it
6140618 in past cycles certainly lending or credit has gotten more difficult the cost of credit would go up in this particular phenomenon of the last year its not like you can borrow money and the price went up no the markets closed
6140619 the one thing that is distressed is the bond market itself
6140620 from a traditional corporate finance perspective this is an investment grade company the rating agencies say so and the balance sheet says so
6140621 the biggest threat to the economy is the fragility in the financial system which stems largely from the deteriorating performance of residential real estate credit
6140622 that performance is unlikely to improve until there are signs of some stabilization in house prices
6140623 im not sure this is the most cost effective use of these funds
6140624 sometimes an experiment like this is just that an experiment and you dont find out until later that it doesnt really work out too well
6140625 there was a sense that they needed to put some money toward the problem and do that fairly quickly before the election
6140626 thats probably why there wasnt as much of a consultative process as there might have been had they had more time to put something together and really vet it out
6140627 later i discovered that this was a result of the subprime meltdown
6140628 acorns interest is in making sure that the cities that are developing plans to use this money put it to good use
6140629 those foreclosures are being purchased at a very rapid rate and they are going to families who have been previously price excluded out of the market
6140630 one comes on the market and its gone seven days later
6140631 i think if the government had wanted to buy homes a few months ago maybe it would have helped but if theyre going to start six months from now or later it can only hurt
6140632 the truth of the matter is any time the government gets involved they distort the market
6140633 who from these cities is in a position to do this work
6140634 on the surface it sounds like a good thing but the logistics of it make it almost impossible
6140635 once you get to 50 of the median income home ownership becomes difficult to stretch to even rentals can be exorbitant
6140636 your water pipes break and you need to have the wherewithal to get them fixed if you have a really low income that could be tough
6140637 our proposals will be designed to ensure the smooth functioning of markets and to support equally the important role of bets on the upside and the downside
6140638 we are looking to see what were the consequences of doing that
6140639 commodity trading funds which had a storming year till june have been hit by the falls in energy prices they make money on trends and when trends unwind they lose money
6140640 there was a tendency for funds that did well in june to do badly in july
6140641 i would prefer to see them credibly and demonstrably privatized
6140642 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
6140643 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see
6140644 i certainly dont think the federal funds rate should be any lower given where we are
6140645 i am broadly confident in the ability for commercial banks to weather the storm
6140646 it was an unusually straightforward answer for a fed official
6140647 we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests
6140648 the too big to fail problem has once again gotten worse
6140649 our ability to exercise independent judgment about the level of the policy rate i think is quite important
6140650 i do see some merits to the argument that adding responsibilities could threaten to dilute the independence
6140651 the reasonable policy debate will be around holding versus raising rates
6140652 yet he was also concerned about rising inflation i think growth is going to be the dominant concern and thats whats going to carry the day for most of the people there
6140653 i think the attorney general is going to come down pretty hard on merrill
6140654 i want to make sure research cannot be accused of causing a run on the auction desk like was the case in august
6140655 a bit more aggressive in using the research arm in obtaining a positive light before the market collapsed
6140656 this company was aggressively selling auction rate securities to investors and its auction desk was censoring the research analysts to make sure they downplayed ars market risks in research reports up to the day merrill pulled the plug on its auctions
6140657 in the absence of fresh interventions from the authorities mortgage lending activity is set to worsen in the second half of 2008
6140658 dampening of consumer demand due to tightened lending criteria declining house prices and pressures on household finances from higher food and energy costs
6140659 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6140660 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6140661 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6140662 we dont need an economic stimulus plan which would be an artificial plan
6140663 commence this attempt at coordination which it has to be said hasnt happened yet
6140664 there is a sense of mystery about what the boj does more so than with other central banks so this is japans attempt to follow
6140665 provides detailed explanations and solid logic though his language is more boring than fukuis
6140666 shirakawa carefully avoided commenting on inflation risks and instead underlined that japans economic situation is different from those of the u s and europe
6140667 if it had been fukui he would have made more hawkish remarks
6140668 de facto announcement of the future level of the policy interest rate means disregarding the changes in economic conditions after such an announcement
6140669 with a clearer picture of the bojs intentions investors can be more confident about their own forecasts which makes it harder for politicians comments to sway markets
6140670 i thought about it am i selling piece by piece the land my grandfather fought for
6140671 but these days someone is going to sell anyway so why wouldnt it be me
6140672 the more russia engages in power politics either through economic political or military means the more cautious
6140673 theyre dangerous and it isnt right that when we now finally have good roads theyre being turned into parking lots for russian trucks
6140674 i think its clear that this strategy hasnt produced results
6140675 business has soared from absolutely no demand five years ago
6140676 the houses stay dark snow isnt plowed and the town gains no economic benefit
6140677 theres no doubt were in a period of stagflation now
6140678 the recent burst of cost push inflation is giving the beast digestion problems that might manifest themselves in the form of a lingering inflationary fever
6140679 the producer price index for finished goods advanced 1 2 percent in june seasonally adjusted
6140680 if he catches me looking at him a few times during the evening hell surely come over to say hello
6140681 if he doesnt theres probably a good reason hes spoken for gay or im just not his cup of tea
6140682 majoring in physical life or computer sciences mathematics technology or engineering or in a foreign language determined critical to national security
6140683 i had a dream and you were in it we were both iron man fighting aliens no lie

6140693 dogs trained to locate live bed bugs and viable bed bug eggs had an overall accuracy of 97 which is similar to previous studies on insect detector dogs
6140694 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6140695 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea

6140699 the strait of hormuz is one of 14 locations in the world with unique strategic importance
6140700 oil production and the transportation of oil via the strait of hormuz require regional stability and security if the gulf region becomes unstable this would entail fundamental and grave problems for the export of persian gulf oil
6140701 iran is the largest and strongest independent country in the middle east
6140702 irans response to any kind of military action that jeopardizes its interests will be swift resolute and crushing iran has declared several times that it will use all possible means to deal with military threats

6140704 in the event of military action by an enemy no one should expect iran to refrain from using every available means of self defense including closing the strait of hormuz with a view to damaging the invaders interests
6140705 the captors know that in the event of an attack on iran they will be unable to withdraw all their forces from iraq and afghanistan overnight and flee since the pasbandar region up to the delta of the arwand river i e shatt al arab which is considered one of the flanks of the persian gulf as well as part of the gulf of oman is controlled by iran meaning that iran maintains a hold on the enemys vital arteries
6140706 60 of all oil consumed worldwide passes through the persian gulf
6140707 these days although no incident has as yet occurred oil prices have risen from 12 to 120 a barrel now try to calculate how high the price of this essential commodity will rise if the enemy acts in a foolhardy manner compelling iran to defend itself

6140714 if kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against washington it would have
6140715 even though the embassy attacks make america look weak the many success stories imply that the u
6140716 that this campaign of disruption had done much to dissipate the threat
6140717 in retrospect there were also specific indications of a bomb plot
6140718 it seems as if threat assessment personnel in washington did not take the warning signs as seriously as did the embassy personnel in nairobi
6140719 killed only or nearly only individuals who were innocent of the embassy bombings
6140720 demonstrating how little the u s could achieve e g limited physical damage
6140721 the attack provoked a new round of terrorist bombing plots
6140722 appeared to many as an underdog standing firm in the face of bullying aggression
6140723 may mean that they shouldnt bear responsibility for the acts of those on their soil
6140724 tfxx01 afghanistan reaction to u s strikes follows predicable lines taliban angry their opponents support u s
6140725 will never hand over bin laden to anyone and will protect him with our blood at all costs
6140726 tfx01 sitrep 5 pakistan afghanistan reaction to u s air strikes
6140727 feelings of injustice and victimization in the arab world and growing conviction among arab elites and masses alike that us policies prop up corrupt regimes favor israel at arab expense and are designed to divide weaken and exploit the arab world are rooted in negative arab perceptions of specific us policies bin ladin rides this tide of opinion though few arabs endorse his terrorism many share at least some of his political sentiments
6140728 afghanistan reported activities of extremist arabs and pakistanis since august 20 u s strike on khost terrorist camps
6140729 afghanistan tensions reportedly mount within taliban as ties with saudi arabia deteriorate over bin ladin
6140730 if pakistan the talibans closest international supporter throws in its weight behind saudi arabia on the bin laden issue the pressure on the taliban may become unbearable as of this time pakistan has not yet made its position clear
6140731 usama bin ladin coordinating our efforts and sharpening our message on bin ladin
6140732 the cornerstone of u s efforts to bring bin ladin to justice
6140733 there appears no chance they will give him up to us
6140734 the saudis can also prove useful in upping the pressure on the taliban by undertaking efforts to cut off their access to the gulf states most importantly with the uae which is the talibans major entrepot for trade and smuggling
6140735 appears to be strongly committed to bin ladin it is questionable whether u s or saudi efforts can influence omars decisions maybe pakistan can but even that is not known with any certainty
6140736 afghanistan taliban leader mullah omar intimations of radical pan islamic thinking
6140737 are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no conditions expel bin ladin because they see his cause as theirs
6140738 how we can persuade the taliban to expel usama bin laden from afghanistan to a country where he can be brought to justice or otherwise end or limit the threat he poses to u s interests
6140739 to get ubl expelled have been frustrated we believe by his ties to taliban leader mullah omar
6140740 an opportunity to get this message across at the highest level in direct terms
6140741 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance of ubls presence to more active support
6140742 osama bin laden taliban spokesman seeks new proposal for resolving bin laden problem
6140743 that the u s in particular wanted bin laden expelled from afghanistan at all costs
6140744 if they chose to back terrorism they could expect to be the recipient of terrorism in response
6140745 kandahar mullah omar was still trying to find a proper way to resolve the issue
6140746 issue of the presence of osama bin laden on afghan soil to the forefront
6140747 if kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against washington it would have but it did not want anymore strikes against anyone
6140748 an authentic proposal for resolving the bin laden issue that would have enabled the taliban to expel bin laden in a way that avoided the internal problems that the taliban leadership feared saudi
6140749 for the u s to kill him or arrange for bin laden to be assassinated

6140754 we hoped to find out what made rachel corrie different from the stereotype of todays consumerist depoliticized youth
6140755 weve tried to do justice to the whole of rachel neither saint nor traitor both serious and funny messy and talented devastatingly prescient and human and whole we chose rachels words rather than those of the thousands of palestinian or israeli victims because of the quality and accessibility of the writing
6140756 ive no doubt at all that had she lived there would have been novels and plays pouring out of her
6140757 the uniform answer we got that the fantasy that we could present the work of this writer simply as a work of art without appearing to take a position was just that a fantasy

6140782 john was not an artist who incidentally was deaf but rather a deaf artist one in a long tradition that owes many of its features and achievements to the fact that deaf people are as scholars have noted visual people
6140783 she stares directly at the viewer though softly even submissively while her husband stares off into the distance as if locked in some deep thought
6140784 unable to hear and speak john focused his energy and ability to capture minute differences in facial expression john also greatly emphasised the gaze of his sitters as eye contact was such a critical part of communication among the deaf scientific studies have proven that since deaf people rely on visual cues for communication they can differentiate subtle differences in facial expressions much better than hearing people

6140786 strangely low and wildly out of scale the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains john looks like a giant
6140787 brewsters serene and ethereal portrait of francis o watts is one of his most compelling portraits of a child in this work particularly francis white dress and the peaceful landscape he inhabits modern viewers often feel a palpable sense of the silence that was johns world
6140788 the bird on the string symbolises mortality because only after the childs death could the bird go free just like the childs soul infant mortality was high during johns time and artists employed this image often in association with children

6140793 an invaluable record of his era and a priceless artistic legacy
6140794 brewsters deafness may also have shaped his mature portrait style which centers on his emphasis on the face of his sitters particularly the gaze

6140797 obamas campaign on monday scoffed at the mccain proposals but obama hasnt been talking boldly about the certain path to a balanced budget he promises to cut taxes for most americans and he has a full plate of spending initiatives
6140798 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
6140799 obamas spending agenda exceeding 307 billion a year dwarfs that of bill clinton a decade and a half ago and he would be sure to run into the same immovable mathematical obstacle faced by the last democratic president taxing the handful of ceos and other fat cats wont be enough the big money obama wants will have to come from the many millions of middle class taxpayers
6140800 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
6140801 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
6140802 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
6140803 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
6140804 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
6140805 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
6140806 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
6140807 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
6140808 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list

6140845 we have lacked ruthlessness in tight heineken cup games and how many times have we failed to get a bonus point try in the magners league
6140846 we want to be a little bit more adventurous and be ruthless when it comes to taking our opportunities
6140847 you can relate some of this back to the age of our squad
6140848 every year they are learning we scraped through from our heineken cup pool last season and then we were unbelievably disappointing in the quarter final at saracens
6140849 hopefully this season well learn from that experience but generally we have failed to really be ruthless in these games
6140850 thats something we really want to change and focus on
6140851 but you can talk about being ruthless and it becomes pretty wishy washy but its about how you become ruthless in terms of what we do as forwards how we complement what our backs are doing in attack
6140852 under pressure do we deliver the skills are our core skills good enough to be able to be ruthless these are all the things weve been working on
6140853 we intend to go out there and be true to ourselves these are the things weve worked on and hopefully thats what people will see from us this season
6140854 i think seeing what went on behind the scenes with the all blacks coaches will help in dealing with the pressures of being part of the ospreys management

6140898 five of the top seven nand suppliers had either declines or zero revenue growth during the period
6140899 based on the recent rankings samsung maintained its number 1 position in the nand market with 42 3 percent market share recorded during q2 08
6140900 during the quarter toshibas nand sales hit 925 million down 1 8 percent from the first period
6140901 hynix takes the third spot in the nand market with 13 4 percent market share recorded during q2 08

6140908 now instead of having to reverse engineer or re develop a commonly used component companies can actually reap the productivity benefit of off the shelf certifiable networking and processor ip with the confidence of knowing that it supports the design assurance needs of their flows and thus does not present a certification risk
6140909 dealing with cots ip under the guidance of do 254 has been one of the industrys biggest challenges to date im excited to see vendors like altera and mentor taking the initiative to address a very important aspect of these flows to make cots ip compliant with do 254 their efforts could save hardware applicants a lot of resources and frustration
6140910 by leveraging the multicore technology in labview and the latest ni multicore pxi embedded controller we were able to increase our test throughput by one additional workday per week

6141104 a few years ago i bought a food sealer and what i do is cook the week before burning man and divide up the food into 1 or 2 serving portions seal it and freeze the food
6141105 whenever someone is ready to eat in the camp they grab a bag of the entr e they desire and throw it in a pot of boiling water for five to 10 minutes
6141106 because the food is sealed we can keep the same pot of water on the stove for a day or two because the food never touches the water

6141115 he had this backing band and there was this guy dad would refer to as ricky he was just a young guitarist starting out it turned out to be ritchie blackmore from deep purple

6141168 paulson can play this game for as long as he wants but the end is becoming visible
6141169 at some point investors are going to say these companies are too big a risk to buy their debt
6141170 i think many people in michigan and kansas and across the country really dont know much about john mccains policies and how he has voted the last 25 years
6141171 instead of building two new coal plants which would produce 11 million new tons of carbon dioxide each year
6141172 we now know that carbon has a huge impact on the atmosphere and global warming is very real in a state like kansas where over 20 percent of our jobs and economy involves agriculture and the land changes in the climate and atmosphere can be devastating kansas has great opportunities in clean energy and alternative fuels
6141173 new transmission lines were to be part of the 3 6 billion sunflower electric power corp project
6141174 but with the fate of that project in doubt several western kansas officials say their projects arent feasible without the additional transmission capacity
6141175 id say this decision pretty much halts wind development in western kansas
6141176 we need transmission lines and we need the coal plants to get them
6141177 not only do we lose the 3 6 billion expansion investment and those hundreds of jobs wont happen
6141178 but other companies considering expansion in kansas may see us as an unfriendly place to do business and tens of thousands of kansans now face the very real possibility of higher electric bills
6141179 will the fantastic returns of 2006 early 2007 come back
6141180 its really doubtful it was a unique environment where each and every asset class appreciated so it was very difficult to do anything wrong
6141181 until last year wed had a 25 year run of low interest rates excessive liquidity particularly post 9 11 low inflation and relatively good economic growth
6141182 in two three years these businesses will be regulated and as exciting as utilities
6141183 for 2009 i wouldnt say that this will improve dramatically

6141189 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6141190 jessica is americas sweetheart and an internationally known entertainer who takes care of herself you can see it in her smile her skin her confidence and her obvious physical fitness
6141191 i was shocked i just thought we were having a meeting
6141192 im just doing my job you expect good services when you go to other places
6141193 she always has a smile on her face and nothing is a problem
6141194 people often call the council because they have a problem or an issue and raewyn always goes the extra mile to find a solution
6141195 this project is fairly simple inspired by the yarn lambs pride
6141196 for that reason it is not appropriate for him to comment publicly
6141197 there were sufficient to ensure the safety of participants and onlookers
6141198 i think if we play to our potential we can do it
6141199 but in saying that it means that everyone needs to front up and do that
6141200 its always nice to make a final especially when its so long ago since we last made a final that i cant remember when it was
6141201 i think we play attractive aerial netball thats how i would describe it

6141203 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
6141204 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
6141205 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
6141206 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

6141212 a unified view of ligand protected gold clusters as superatom complexes
6141213 my personal dream came true late last year when a group led by roger kornberg at stanford university made a breakthrough experiment determining the atomic structure of gold nanoparticles of a certain size the structure resembled the prediction our research group had already earlier published in the recent study we were able to comprehend why nature generates exactly these kinds of particles the size of one particle is 1 3 nanometers and since they behave in many respects like giant atoms we call them superatoms in our study
6141214 our study would not have been possible without the extensive high performance computing resources of the national it centres of finland germany and sweden the study took up quite a lot of computation time but it was well worth the effort i believe that our theoretical model on the stability of the gold nanoparticles will prove itself very useful in many interdisciplinary fields of research

6141222 cusack grew up in a massive house on sheridan road
6141223 its slightly disingenuous to say he had to scrape together 2 50 im thinking that wasnt an issue
6141224 because of a combination of factors this value add dimension has been severely reversed
6141225 resource costs have increased up to 14 per cent and we have also experienced significantly higher fuel costs and transport surcharges
6141226 when you combine the level of such cost increases and with changes in the pricing structure for casings paradoxically we can obtain significantly better returns for our unprocessed casings than putting them through what is intended to a value add operation
6141227 rather than adding value our centralised processing facility incurs costs which are unsustainable
6141228 i enjoyed farming but i guess in a way i wanted to do something different
6141229 the offer came up to work in chile for a uk firm they wanted to make new zealand style wine using the lower priced chilean fruit
6141230 they wanted someone to come and buy different fruit to talk to wineries organise different wines to be made and to organise contracts
6141231 i was not able to speak spanish whatsoever and had to start business straightaway it was a blur those first few weeks
6141232 i did a lot of driving i worked at a lot of different wineries every day i would go and sit down with the cellar bosses we would talk through and table all our wines and taste them
6141233 you have to understand what styles need to be made to make wines favourable to that culture over the years you understand price points the different genres what is expected out of your wine
6141234 you need a knowledge of your environment you have to learn fast to understand the environment and potential of your fruit there is no one recipe with wine there are so many variables
6141235 it was a large flat valley flanked by mountains with its own microclimate we had a fantastic first three months it rained twice it was very warm and consistent with low humidity it was perfect for producing large quantities of good quality wine
6141236 in chile they make the wine then try to sell it in this respect new zealand is way ahead of the game
6141237 what they called sauvignon blanc were not sauvignon they use inferior varieties it meant you couldnt get the full potential that you would have got from sauvignon it was an uphill battle all the way we had to change the winemaking method to get the best out of that variety
6141238 it is about doing things at the right time timing is so important
6141239 everyone has a similar palate with similar potential for understanding what they are tasting i drink a lot of different wines for me it is market orientated i have to taste a lot of wines to understand the styles and market
6141240 everyone lives around everyone else we liked that everything revolves around a centralised park called la plaza everyone meets in the park at different times of the day
6141241 they are street dogs a bit like our huntaways they are everywhere no one tries to get rid of them they lie asleep in front of shops on the roads traffic has to negotiate around them
6141242 there are a lot of dead dogs on the road
6141243 there was a large socioeconomic gap between the rich and the poor there werent many rich but those who were had a lot
6141244 another thing i noticed which you dont notice straightaway is the bureaucracy that is a big thing of anything you do every signature needs to be signed by a jp there is a lot of paperwork and contracts are fluid they can change very fast
6141245 ill be looking at settling down i ultimately want to do something with my own wine not the typical thing perhaps jointly marketing wines and possibly sheep wine and nukuhakari lamb

6141357 the fallacy of the headline is that there is a direct competition between the two that its either or the reality is that strong global economic growth has changed the demand equation for u s commodities
6141358 the depreciation of the u s dollar soaring energy costs and changing trade policies are also contributing to the cost of commodities which in turn is raising the cost of food its not just fuel its a combination of all of these factors

6141588 it is caused by the ink left on the plates
6141589 its a wonderful wonderful thrill to hold that wet print
6141590 that means it was printed by hand like i do
6141591 it is obsolete of course if youre talking about printing but artists still do this
6141592 you do get a feel you are doing things in the same way artists in the past did
6141593 they would rub dark oil into the lines to see the design in the gold
6141594 finally it got to the point where they would engrave something for the print itself
6141595 here i am using the same tools the same materials
6141596 the tool is unchanged from engravers of the renaissance when copper plant engravings was the form of engravings
6141597 im going to do these gravel roads until i cant do them anymore
6141598 the demand for tickets this morning was just immense all the ticket sites slowed down severely but nothing crashed and the system worked very smoothly we want to thank the fans for their patience and look forward to seeing you all at the shows

6141602 sen obama given your education skills and background why didnt you take the relatively simple step of amending the draft so that the bill would work
6141603 anybody that knows anything that would help the el dorado police department to help find stevens remains
6141604 we know hes gone but we just would like to find his remains and maybe take him home
6141605 steven had a lot of friends out here and anyone who knows anything we would appreciate it
6141606 detective young has been wonderful and hes got a good crew out there working
6141607 when steven was alive we never went to his work site
6141608 we always stayed out the house when we came out
6141609 theyre going to find him they are theyre working very very hard i just feel so good that someone is going to know something that will help them i just hope they will come forward to help
6141610 they have gone into water areas theyve gone into all kinds of places looking because theres a lot of well area around here
6141611 i think detective young wants to solve this so bad that he has rounded up people and hes believed what i said and before nobody did
6141612 we know it happened on that friday night because i talked to him at 11 oclock your time
6141613 and he was to call me back at nine oclock in the morning and he didnt when i called the police to go check on the house the lights were on the fan was going the door was open and the screen door was shut nothing was disturbed
6141614 but i knew it wasnt and i couldnt convince anyone else
6141615 this was the son that used to send me thank you cards on his birthday
6141616 but when i was out here in october after he died in july i was chasing the wrong person that wasnt who it was
6141617 its kind of hard to believe that somebody you know had something to do with that
6141618 there was a drug deal going down and he witnessed it and he died that night
6141619 i know he was but you cant do a whole lot about suspicions
6141620 god will take care of you one way or another
6141621 its hard on mothers day its hard on his birthday
6141622 you know 22 years ago i could have killed him
6141623 it was a mothers right i was running on pure emotion and i was going after the wrong person
6141624 bad airflow in your case we wont replace your card or
6141625 weve learned that nvidia is working hard to launch gt200 55nm but this will most certainly wont happen in august or september our sources imply that this will take place in q4 2008 nvidia simply wants to win the performance crown back from r700 adding gddr5 memory and 55nm process will certainly speed things up and they will take the dissipation down thermal dissipation is nvidias biggest problem as the chip turns to be extremely hot and the new 55nm should be a bit better once you take care of thermals you can clock the chip higher which eventually means more performance the 55nm process with a new clock and gddr5 memory should get gt200 55nm a bit faster than r700 and this is exactly what nvidia needs
6141626 were glad to have students from so many great schools participate in this inaugural poll

6141655 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6141656 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6141657 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6141658 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6141713 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6141738 mufg will not need to raise capital the deal will not cause dilution and we estimate a positive eps impact
6141739 the financial impact of the transaction is limited to the deduction from capital of the cash payout
6141740 if mufg want to quickly inject capital its much easier to do it if unbc is a 100 subsidiary
6141741 such a strategy is far easier than hostile m amp a yet it pumps up the top line and shareholder returns plus it enables the bank to puts its capital to work in an efficient way
6141742 buying an investment banking entity to service japanese companies in the us is the priority but failing that buying some retail banking businesses is an option a privatised unbc could act as a regional expansion vehicle

6141758 post partisan my ass that might be a good theme as a campaign strategy it might appeal to an electorate tired of the incompetent ineffectual and just plain stupid brand of government they have been getting for the last ten years you know since the incredibly partisan impeachment of bill clinton by the republican congress it might sound nice and evenhanded and reasonable and mature and responsible and all that but it ignores the simple and undeniable fact that since the republicans lied cheated and smeared including smearing their current champion when he was running against bush their way into having full unfettered dominance of the government just about everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and the country is in sad sorry shape everything the republicans has touched in the last decade has turned to crap from the micro life saving stem cell research to the macro climate crisis the republicans have had full power to implement their vision programs and policies and have gotten it wrong every single time

6141778 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6141779 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6141780 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6141781 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6141782 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6141783 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6141784 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6141785 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6141786 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6141815 our members are taking this action very reluctantly they care deeply about the vital services they provide and those who depend on them and we apologise for any disruption
6141816 however members feel they have no choice when the employers offer is effectively a pay cut
6141817 council staff in scotland have delivered nearly 200 million worth of efficiency savings that councils should share with staff as well as with council tax payers
6141818 it is in no ones interest for there to be further disruption least of all the people in our communities who most rely on the services provided by councils and their employees we have always been willing to talk that willingness remains the same

6141823 despite my bone marrow being more dysfunctional than a group of asbo kids who have recently guzzled ready meals aplenty washed down with flagons of pop i have to say i have a new found respect for this incredible tissue
6141824 the chemotherapy seemed to be going well but then my doctors got a letter from the genetics laboratory tests on a sample of my bone marrow showed i had a second type of chronic leukaemia
6141825 i wish none of this was happening to me but it is how do i talk seriously to my girlfriend poppy about dying much younger than i should do we go for ivf knowing full well that by the time his children are ten i could be dead
6141826 finally some great news ive been given the all clear its hard to describe how relieved and elated i feel i found out earlier today when i phoned the hospital braced for bad or no news when the doctor told me there was no sign of the disease in my last bone marrow sample i asked him to check and then double check the results before i could finally take them in
6141827 just when everything seemed to be falling into place i have had another kick in the teeth yet again its potentially very serious possibly untreatable but if it was anything less than that i am sure you would refuse to read on any further and quite right too
6141828 merry christmas to everyone just a quick post to let everyone know poppy and i are engaged i asked her to marry me after midnight mass and she said yes i know im not a great investment but it just felt like the right thing to do i have no idea what this year holds and no idea about wedding plans but i know if i can last until the summer it will be a fantastic do
6141829 heartbreak this time i have some really sad news poppy has called off the wedding and decided to separate i have never been so sad in all my life i am utterly heartbroken but the most diffcult thing is that i dont blame her there was no big argument i think there was just the slow realisation of what getting married to me means she also has a new job as for me i already miss her so much and my life is in tatters
6141830 i have one last little mission before i die im determined to try and educate more people about what it is like to be a bone marrow donor there are still 7 000 people children and adults in the uk alone who are waiting to find a match without your help they have no hope

6141850 we believe she was not going to be truthful and we were not going to put on the witness stand someone we didnt believe was going to give truthful testimony
6141851 since this agreement was entered in june 2007 we all agreed on what she was going to testify to and shes never wavered from that
6141852 they wanted her to change her testimony and she wouldnt
6141853 the goal is to get communitywide input on major development that affects the village so that the village board can benefit from a better cross section of representation on issues
6141854 its more of an evaluation right now to see whether such a group would make sense
6141855 they the advisory board may be a sounding board for review of the new master plan as well as the development guidelines or any future rewrites
6141856 we would want to get more eyes on the issues from a broader public audience rather than just a neighborhood
6141857 it makes it a little bit more difficult for local government to move as quickly as they might want to
6141858 it doesnt slow the process of development approval rather what it does is it results in better decision making from a community planning perspective with the issues that we face here its not such a bad idea to hear what other people are thinking not just at election time but all year round
6141859 ich bin berzeugt von der gro en berufung der kleinen v lker
6141860 welch unermessliche demokratische m glichkeiten im sozialistischen gesellschaftsprojekt bislang brachliegen
6141861 das jahr 1968 ist gekennzeichnet durch die ideologie des reformkommunismus w hrend die leute im jahr 1989 keinen sozialismus mit menschlichem antlitz mehr wollten
6141862 if kids get strong start early in life we can cut our dropout rate and improve our communities
6141863 to help more kids get that strong start we need to fund early childhood education programs and ensure that every child that qualifies is able to enroll
6141864 too many times i have seen young people fail or drop out of school only to end up in police custody shortly thereafter this cycle must be stopped here and now
6141865 im here today with my colleagues to ask congress state and local governments to fully fund early childhood education
6141866 as millions of american children prepare to head back to school its important to recognize that too many of them will leave our educational system without a high school diploma far too often todays dropouts are tomorrows criminals
6141867 focusing on early education for young children will help ensure they can look forward to graduation and a good career not a life of crime
6141868 research shows that children who receive quality early childhood education have a much better chance of finishing high school
6141869 by earning a diploma theyre more likely to find good jobs and contribute to our economy instead of our prison population
6141870 the bottom line here is that early education is one of the most effective ways to ensure that kids succeed early on and go on to graduate
6141871 and increasing the number of high school graduates will reduce the crime and violence in our communities and bolster our economy in the long run
6141872 this issue is not just about how to cover the uninsured
6141873 it is much more about how do we hold down on health care costs for every american
6141874 our countrys ability to solve its health care crisis depends to no small extent on whether our political and private sector leaders can articulate a shared vision of the kind of health care system that will meet the needs of americans in the 21st century
6141875 there are indications that the elements of such a vision may be finally emerging
6141876 such a shared vision would have powerful potential to drive enactment and implementation of the health care reform americans need and deserve

6141921 im getting gray hair running for president will age you quick
6141922 its been gradual it hasnt been all of a sudden its the norm for his age group
6141923 i dont think hes trying to hide anything hes proud of the few gray hairs he does have when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
6141924 its an absolute benefit for him gray hair helps because it makes people look like theyre older and in his case he needs it
6141925 it has nothing to do with stress it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life
6141926 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people are seeing their incomes decline
6141927 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6141928 i will let no one question my love of this country
6141929 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6141930 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6141931 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues

6141933 acne is a vicious cycle it can be a huge stressor for teenagers which can often lead to more acne breakouts
6141934 emotional stress has been linked to severe acne episodes and certain factors in a teens life such as getting ready to go back to school trying out for a sports team or fitting into a social niche can cause anxiety and distress i recommend that my younger patients schedule a back to school visit to gain control of their skin before these emotional factors affect them
6141935 like most teens i went though a very awkward stage of my life where i wasnt comfortable in my own skin
6141936 our goal at my beauty camp is to teach girls about how to take care of themselves from the inside out and provide them with the necessary tools to boost their self esteem the camp is a great opportunity for girls to attend right before the school year when insecurities can be at their highest
6141937 being beautiful is expressing yourself you have to love yourself and other people and you have to take care of your body and be healthy its knowing that you have natural beauty
6141938 im excited to attend my beauty camp i think its going to be a great way to learn about the latest beauty and health tips discover more about myself and make new friends

6141943 die ethnische herkunft des patienten spielt bei einigen medikamenten eine gro e rolle
6141944 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
6141945 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
6141946 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
6141947 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
6141948 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures
6141949 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
6141950 biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of todays problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen ou is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field it is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization ou is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist this initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand
6141951 we know that bacterial cells communicate much like those that cause disease if we know the language they use we can send signals and interrupt their communications so they will change their behavior the best way to treat the biocorrosion problem has not yet been determined active ongoing monitoring of pipelines tells us there is an ongoing process but we need to get to the problem before it gets to the critical stage some and perhaps most microorganisms are not routinely monitored so we have to understand the role they play in this process information we can use to more effectively diagnose and treat the consequences
6141952 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
6141953 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
6141954 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
6141955 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
6141956 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
6141957 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
6141958 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
6141959 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
6141960 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
6141961 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
6141962 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
6141963 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
6141964 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
6141965 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences
6141966 their friends are quite pleased that theyre gettign back together and are trying to give them space
6141967 shes the most discerning person ive ever met shell read a script 100 times shes relentless
6141968 going forward the outlook remains challenging for government with borrowing and debt on a clear upward trend and the economy set for a period of minimal growth and even contraction public finances look susceptible to further unscheduled borrowing
6141969 the treasury forecast of growth in the range 2 25 to 2 75 per cent in 2009 now looks hopelessly optimistic suggesting public finances could be stretched particularly in 2009
6141970 recently the secretary of state ruled that the 250 person meeting requirement may be satisfied by holding a meeting at an outdoor location
6141971 the socialist party set up its meeting at an outdoor spot on the campus of the university of iowa that spot had lots of pedestrian traffic persons walking by were asked to sign and that person was considered an attendee

6141985 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
6141986 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
6141987 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
6141988 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
6141989 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
6141990 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
6141991 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
6141992 all we know so far is that it is small
6141993 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
6141994 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
6141995 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
6141996 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
6141997 this experiment asks key questions about how our corner of the universe exists today as it does with matter but no anti matter
6141998 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6141999 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6142000 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6142001 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
6142002 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6142003 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
6142004 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
6142005 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court

6142010 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

6142040 under the ncaa rule implemented for this season at the end of every play the referee takes a deep breath then signals for the 40 second clock to start that rule is similar to the one used in the national football league last season the ncaa 25 second clock did not start until the officials marked the ball ready for play
6142041 then you have to come all the way back while the clock is running
6142042 when the refs took their time to put the ball down there was more thinking time now its pretty fast especially when guys take deep routes you have to take into consideration substitutions fatigue and all of that stuff you almost have to have two scenarios ready in your head for a completion and an incompletion
6142043 we went the whole practice and didnt have a penalty on the 40 second clock and we had officials i was really pleased at how our tempo is right now
6142044 we might not get delay of game calls but we dont want to snap the ball before we want to we have to have our calls before we snap it
6142045 i was trying to get used to the pace of the game running every play and turning around and getting back to the huddle real quick it definitely takes some getting used to
6142046 the coaches also tried to get the warriors accustomed to the warm conditions they will face for the aug 30 opener against florida the warriors who usually practice in the morning began yesterdays workout at 12 30 p m the aloha stadium crew also watered the fieldturf in the morning the combination of moisture and mid day sun was to create a sauna effect
6142047 theres nothing you can do to simulate the florida weather its a lot more humid itll be all right when there are tough times tired times you have to fight through it
6142048 it might work in my favor to redshirt ill still have two years to play i dont want to waste a year
6142049 im still trying to work up the depth chart ill talk to coach and see what he thinks is best

6142051 kfve has been a proud supporter and partner of uh sports for 25 years its a wonderful opportunity through hawaii iptv to be able to give our athletics and athletic programs this kind of exposure outside of the state
6142052 the agreement excludes uh road games and any games blacked out due to espn or other nationwide television broadcasts
6142053 seven uh football games 22 rainbow wahine volleyball matches and 24 mens basketball games are among the initial offerings planned in addition to baseball mens volleyball and womens basketball according to hawaii iptvs web site www tvfromhawaii com fink said hawaii iptv has the rights to select from kfves 100 sporting events offered uh road contests and games carried by espn and the western athletic conference tv partners are not available

6142056 he called on teammates just days before her death and they answered showing up at hawaii medical center east to pray over her
6142057 this is a close team and they all love vaughn and think the world of him coaches and players rallied around him and hes a class act were a part of his family too hes got a great family and i know his mom is watching over him too
6142058 i learned both left and right sides so if i get in the game i can take out either person
6142059 i would feel confident putting him in the game if i need to
6142060 its going pretty good so far ive been getting a lot of reps especially because fale guys have been out ive just been lucky im learning how to push through when im tired the coaches have a lot of confidence in me so that gives me confidence
6142061 a big factor in our plans were going to have fun this season and hes going to be a big part of it
6142062 my family and my girlfriend helped me to stay on track and whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger and it just made me stronger
6142063 my mom can make it to every one of my games now
6142064 they were coming a lot harder there was a lot more competition they were getting excited trying to hit somebody i was running a little bit faster throwing a little bit harder it felt good
6142065 the warriors practiced on their home field for the first time in fall camp using the first of two opportunities to work out at aloha stadium game conditions were simulated from the cooling misters on the sidelines to the coaches testing out the headsets in the booth
6142066 this is the time were actually going to play there so we tried to get on the turf where its as hot as it can be they watered it right before we came in so it would steam up a little bit its not as hot as were going to get but were going to work on it a couple of times its the first time for a lot of the guys its an impressive stadium its fun to be here and it sort of spiced up practice it made every drill game like
6142067 i could not wait i was definitely looking forward to this it was pretty important getting used to the scenery and just getting a feel for the place
6142068 the level of competition was way up on offense and defense it definitely feels like the seasons here i have to learn a little bit more pick up my progressions a little bit quicker but im ready
6142069 weve been working on that but yesterday it was regulated and it was a game situation and we didnt have a single 40 second clock penalty
6142070 were playing at 12 30 and they say its going to be real hot so we came out here to play in the middle of the day we were out there just working for it getting ready
6142071 des was going for the ball i could have got it but des got his hands on it give credit to des
6142072 the turf is fast you can make plays a lot better coach greg mcmackin wants us to make plays and were just out here doing what he tells us
6142073 you get that feeling to really get your mind right its good
6142074 i think were right on schedule its the execution that has to improve its a long season and weve got to get better but i was happy with the work
6142075 wasnt thinking of diane schroer when he helped pass the civil rights act

6142079 we had more capital than weve ever had at any pointin our history
6142080 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveragedto a depreciating asset housing and losses are off thecharts and no signs of stability
6142081 the companies leveraged up their capital to the point thatthey have created systemic risk
6142082 during the periodthey leveraged up the price of housing began to level off andultimately tanked
6142083 its the capitalthat buffers you and holds you in a good safe and soundposition against those losses
6142084 you can not tell the difference in mp3 and cd

6142086 3 hr ago 2 17 and blu is correctly spelled blue but disc is the correct spelling for compact disc its actually spelled disc in this case
6142087 is that an ipod or an mp3 player because i dont want to buy an ipod theyre too expensive i want an mp3 player
6142088 youre dead to me cd and i never liked you in the first place
6142089 the cd of course wasnt without its drawbacks they disliked abuse and absolutely had to live in their cases
6142090 fish and plankton and sea greens and protein from the sea

6142092 you cant call it a compact disc nor can you show the logo
6142093 once mass producing becomes less expensive we will be able to offer music cds for less than cassettes

6142120 jadwal kapal semakin lama tertunda pelayanan tidak semakin bagus pada saat volume barang meningkat
6142121 pelayanan di utpk belum mampu mengatasi persoalan klasik seperti minimnya alat bongkar muat
6142122 tahun ini kami perkirakan pelayanan bisa kami lakukan antara 20 000 dan 22 000 teus namun posisi sekarang volume barang mencapai 32 000 teus
6142123 idealnya pelayanan bisa maksimal jika satu kapal yang bersandar dilayani dua crane sekaligus namun belakangan yang terjadi tiga kapal yang bersandar dilayani oleh satu crane dan satu kapal oleh dua crane sehingga wajar pelayanan menjadi terhambat

6142173 im surprised that he still has job im tired of people getting away with stuff like this its unacceptable i would be remiss as a parent and an educator if i did not say anything
6142174 it seems to me he was making a stereotypcial comment that the reason we have this problem is because we have a lot of black students
6142175 why did he need to make a racial comment it made me feel like this is not a good person to have as superintendent of the largest school district in our area
6142176 i see alvin wilbanks probably doing more for public education than any else i know
6142177 it would be very scary for me if i had to go out and hire a superintendent tomorrow he is a very good man and he is a very compassionate man
6142178 this type of rhetoric not only dishonors gwinnett county public schools but casts a cloud on the abilities of superintendent wilbanks and the school board members to lead the school system effectively

6142188 high commissioner john dauth has apologised to miss clark who has accepted the apology
6142189 miss clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and that she had had a bit of a laugh
6142190 she is renowned for her managerial skills the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
6142191 she holds generally leftwing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war
6142192 she does not trust those outside the small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in new zealand known as h2
6142193 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs of other leaders fall off the back of trucks youd all have a lot of laughs as well
6142194 for that reason it is not appropriate for him to comment publicly
6142195 she was the most delicate pretty innocent naive person you could ever meet
6142196 the first person i spoke to positively identified kerry they described what she was wearing and said she was carrying a cat carry cage
6142197 then it was just a matter of getting police there
6142198 i dont think im brave i was just convinced that what had happened wasnt right
6142199 you couldnt meet a more kind and compassionate person than kerry

6142350 with the addition of these three projects we are now actively working on approximately 19 projects in some stage of development the addition of these projects is very representative of our process we sign initial agreements and then move along the development cycle with our local owner groups over a normal course of time until we construct and commission a wind farm while all of these projects take some time to develop we have a good idea of their potential success before we ever sign initial agreements
6142351 adding 3 projects in the last couple of months is also representative of the strong demand in the market for community wind farms
6142352 since going public with our increased awareness we are receiving regular inquiries from groups of local owners almost on a daily basis this is exactly what we hoped for when we went public at the end of june we want our friends in rural america to know that they dont have to turn their land over to large wind developers instead they can work with us and own their own wind farm and keep a much larger share of the economic benefits for themselves and their neighbors

6142413 i really had no idea that he would throw me out
6142414 he made an unbelievable play i saw it on the replay he slid on his knees barehanded it and threw a strike the way were swinging the bats right now i thought being aggressive was the best option
6142415 every night that you lose it makes it more difficult
6142416 its really comforting to know theyre giving me a couple of games to see how it goes
6142417 thats the best part for me because ive already started my routine for the next five days and its nice knowing im going to be here
6142418 international flights have historically been sacrosanct from these kinds of charges
6142419 this is the new era of a fee for every service we should get used to it
6142420 these changes are difficult but necessary and we do not make them lightly
6142421 however they enable us to reduce costs and generate additional revenue while preserving a differentiated product for our premium cabin customers
6142422 profits should not be put above the risk to public health and there had been a significant risk
6142423 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6142424 dont bother people dont ask for favors youll be annoying youll be indebted
6142425 this working person with a title is no different than me s he has a problem which i need to learn more about and i have solutions
6142426 this person wants to see me and our meeting will be great for both of us if not its his her loss not mine

6142431 a total of 67 new york based start ups received funding in the first half of this year the highest amount since 2001 and investment jumped to 828 million from 480 million in the first half of 2007
6142432 periodical exams were postponed on august 14 to 15 and students dont obey our advice to stay home until things return to normal
6142433 i even saw a student with patches of pieces of intermediate paper on the head and drops of candle wax on the feet after treatment by a faith healer
6142434 were open to whatever will be effective and will heal the students we want our classes to return to normal as soon as possible

6142436 rachael ray asks for threesome roseanne asks for brangeloonie fight
6142437 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6142438 im carrying a weapon flying a multimillion dollar jet with passengers but im still screened as you know on the terrorist watch list
6142439 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
6142440 and all of a sudden he says how old is he
6142441 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
6142442 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
6142443 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
6142444 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
6142445 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
6142446 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll
6142447 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6142448 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6142449 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6142450 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6142451 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6142452 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6142453 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6142454 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6142455 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6142456 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6142457 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6142458 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6142459 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6142460 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6142461 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
6142462 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6142463 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6142464 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
6142465 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6142466 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6142467 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6142468 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6142469 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
6142470 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
6142471 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
6142472 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
6142473 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
6142474 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
6142475 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
6142476 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
6142477 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
6142478 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
6142479 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
6142480 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
6142481 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6142482 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6142483 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
6142484 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6142485 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6142486 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6142487 the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6142488 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6142489 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6142490 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6142491 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6142492 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6142493 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6142494 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6142495 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6142496 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6142497 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6142498 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6142499 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid
6142500 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6142501 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6142502 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6142503 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6142504 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6142505 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6142506 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6142507 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that

6142598 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
6142599 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6142600 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6142601 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6142602 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6142603 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6142604 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
6142605 there must be something real special in the water down there

6142627 if kids get strong start early in life we can cut our dropout rate and improve our communities
6142628 to help more kids get that strong start we need to fund early childhood education programs and ensure that every child that qualifies is able to enroll
6142629 too many times i have seen young people fail or drop out of school only to end up in police custody shortly thereafter this cycle must be stopped here and now
6142630 im here today with my colleagues to ask congress state and local governments to fully fund early childhood education
6142631 as millions of american children prepare to head back to school its important to recognize that too many of them will leave our educational system without a high school diploma far too often todays dropouts are tomorrows criminals
6142632 focusing on early education for young children will help ensure they can look forward to graduation and a good career not a life of crime
6142633 research shows that children who receive quality early childhood education have a much better chance of finishing high school
6142634 by earning a diploma theyre more likely to find good jobs and contribute to our economy instead of our prison population
6142635 the bottom line here is that early education is one of the most effective ways to ensure that kids succeed early on and go on to graduate
6142636 and increasing the number of high school graduates will reduce the crime and violence in our communities and bolster our economy in the long run

6142677 its a medical clinic and an orphanage for children that have been involved and whose parents have been involved in the violence in afghanistan
6142678 for those that have been orphaned by a conflict thats lasted for god knows how many years im going out there im obviously not gonna be able to administer the entire project but i feel like its essential to be involved the aspect of media coverage is essential i joined with the human rights organisation to facilitate this i get lots of programmes shown to me i could choose to do this or choose to do that and this particular time around i wanted to do this the need came from the same place that all my music came from it aint like i decided to reach into another part of myself its just a natural progression its a little bit of weight on the shoulders but its something that i welcome because its something i know needs to be done
6142679 i wanted to wake up people in the states and let em know no matter what you think poverty is out here homie you cant even possibly begin to fathom what we facing out in the third world
6142680 i wanted to make it clear and present for them
6142681 but thats not very fair to say as i dont know how many people in london have the opportunity to go to a place like chechnya or bosnia im never of the assuming mind that americans are more ignorant than any other part of the world i think thats unfair to say i think were more visibly ignorant than anybody else because this countrys so much more in control of things in places like france and england that used to be the capital of the world theyre a little bit upset about that so they proliferate that sort of ridiculousness but someone whos in a small village somewhere else isnt gonna be more adept to understanding everything
6142682 two people who are alcoholics one of them is a bum on the street and the other one drives a school bus full of school children the alcoholism of the bum on the street affects nobody in other words the ignorance of somebody who doesnt live in a place that controls things doesnt affect anybody but the ignorance the alcoholism of the man driving the school bus full of kids his drunken state an his inebriated recklessness affects many more peoples lives than his own in other words the people here who have control of the stuff their ignorance their lack of culture their lack of historical knowledge their list for power that affects millions of people
6142683 i went to visit my relatives when i came back i was five six something like that it was strange because at that point i was able to begin to digest what i saw around me when youre a little kid you have flashing images and you can see and remember little things but i can clearly distinctly remember a completely different world than the one i was used to that i left behind in harlem the poverty level was a lot different the fact that there was a guerrilla struggle going on at the time definitely illuminated a lot of things for me and was incredibly powerful to see everywhere you went there were people with machine guns uzis blocking all public entrances searching people at random kind of like weve got here in the states now
6142684 you know if you wanna ride the train you got a motherfucking dude with a damn m16 gonna search through your bag
6142685 its gotten ridiculous when the sean bell thing happened i put out something called the police state chronicles im trying to get a thousand stories signed affidavits of police brutality so that i can finally put this out there and hopefully publish it so that other people can see so that they realise when this keeps happening these arent random incidents there is a pattern of violent abuse that happens on a regular basis cos to keep it really real nypd is the biggest gang in new york they dont fuck around yo if you fuck up one of the theyre gonna fuck up all of you if you screw with one of their family they definitely gonna come get you your car gets stolen they be like alright ill be there you ring them say my neighbours a cop and their cars been stolen copsll be there in like three and a half seconds
6142686 we spoke yeah but they were very non receptive to what i wanted to do and what i wanted to accomplish
6142687 we have to remember that hip hop had a side of it that was just about partying enjoying life and we shouldnt look down upon that cos at the same time every single time that people have been put in a terrible position of bondage they sang songs that didnt have anything to with their condition you know slaves sang songs on the plantation dont mean they enjoyed being there but thats how i look at this there are people who sings songs of joy and people who sing songs about things that theyre not experiencing and things they dont have because they wish they did have it they see that as success whereas i would argue theres different levels of success having chains cars having lots of women thats not success you know having chains cars having lots of women thats not success not as successful id say as having one woman that really loves you and cares physical property that makes you look good isnt as wealthy as being good as being in a righteous position in terms of owning property owning your own home owning a business which you also use for tax purposes so youre not just getting raped by government every year i think just because people run on that level doesnt necessarily take away from very single aspect of their manhood nahmean people try to talk about all those people like theyre all puppets the sad part is the industry has specifically targeted the other side of hip hop
6142688 i think even in the bible when we talk about judgement day apocalypse i think its miss translated
6142689 i know its miss translated its not the end of the world is the end of the age i think a certain age is gonna come to an end it doesnt necessarily mean the entire world as we know it is gonna come to an end but there are gonna be significant changes in terms of making preparations for that i think you know the fact that im buying land in south america that im making myself more self sustainable i think thats a whole part of it im not a prophet brother im not a fortune teller i dont know whats gonna happen i just know theres gonna be some significant change itll probably have a lot to do with the environment though

6142722 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6142723 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6142724 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6142725 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6142726 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6142727 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6142728 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6142742 we needed a central depository in which to store editing knowledge every time we trained a new associate editor we had to teach him or her the style guide and forward multiple emails from years past

6142746 economically theres no doubt that the russians are helping us out of a tough spot

6142750 he refuses to look at anything costing less than 120 million euros as a matter of pride
6142751 one was annoyed about the noise of the train nearby
6142752 so he sent someone to the mairie to offer them 100 million euros to move the station
6142753 a colleague told me that roman abramovitch put in a 950 million euro bid on a house in cap ferrat
6142754 although russians make up the majority of our clientele they want to pay the deposit in cash so theyll plonk down 20 000 euros on the counter obviously we need a credit card otherwise they could drive off with a 2m car

6142787 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6142788 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now

6142831 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6142832 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety

6142835 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6142836 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid

6142838 people people please youre forgetting what the olympics are all about
6142839 on these matters there is a quick fix under pressure the
6142840 what did henry paulson know and when did he know it
6142841 we are centrally located near the junction of highways 1 and 20 and offer a area for large group barbecues and picnics
6142842 a few minutes north of fort bragg is a 22 mile stretch of hwy 1 that defies the senses riders are often befuddled that such a road could even exist perfect tarmac light traffic and endless twists and turns as we ride up and over two mountain ranges arriving in the midst of a redwood forest

6142845 the daily peak season service during christmas would offer malaysian and australian travellers attractive low fares at a time when other airlines typically gouge passengers with super high airfares
6142846 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6142847 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6142848 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6142849 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6142850 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6142851 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6142852 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6142853 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6142854 they told me there are going to be resources here
6142855 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6142856 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6142857 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6142858 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6142859 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6142860 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6142861 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6142862 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6142863 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6142864 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6142865 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6142866 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6142867 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6142868 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6142869 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6142870 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6142871 while we are legally prohibited from stating how unite heres drive is affecting our ability to do business in new bedford we do have the right to protect our employees from harassment on our property we have filed charges against unite here in hopes that the union will stop threatening and harassing our employees
6142872 we regret that this action is necessary but our employees deserve to make their own membership choices without the fear of union harassment
6142873 this presidential election has ignited so many young people to become more involved
6142874 we want to connect our audiences to the process the candidates and issues kids although not legal voters dont want to be on the sidelines

6142880 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6142884 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6142885 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6142886 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6142887 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6142888 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6142889 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6142890 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6142891 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6142892 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6142893 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6142894 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6142895 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6142896 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6142897 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6142898 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6142899 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6142900 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6142901 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6142902 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6142903 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6142904 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6142905 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6142906 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6142907 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6142908 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6142909 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6142910 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6142911 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6142912 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6142913 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6142914 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6142915 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6142916 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6142917 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6142918 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6142919 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6142920 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6142921 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6142922 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6142923 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6142924 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6142925 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6142926 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6142927 it was a big relief to us all of our hard work all the dedication that went into this season
6142928 we had to try to keep our heads and half the time i was trying to keep belly ache bellamy under control

6142930 this recognition means a great deal to our firm our employees and to our clients
6142931 we were extremely pleased to see that we not only ranked number 12 out of more than 475 leading financial advisory firms across the nation but that we also ranked highest among colorado firms for the fourth straight year

6142933 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

6142939 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6142940 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6142941 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6142942 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6142943 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6142944 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6142945 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6142946 failed to adequately warn prescribing physicians of the risk of pancreatitis of measures needed to properly assess the appropriateness of prescribing the drug to certain categories of patients and of measures doctors and patients could and should take to minimize the risk
6142947 it is pretty obvious that the label change in 2007 was not adequate
6142948 we believe that amylin possessed data prior to the 2007 label revision that justified a stronger and more prominent warning than the precaution language that amylin ultimately negotiated with fda
6142949 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6142950 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6142951 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6142952 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6142953 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6142954 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6142955 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6142956 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6142957 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6142958 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6142959 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6142960 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6142961 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6142962 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6142963 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6142964 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6142965 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6142966 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6142967 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6142968 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6142969 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6142970 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6142971 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6142972 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6142973 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6142974 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6142975 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6142976 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6142977 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6142978 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6142979 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6142980 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6142981 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6142982 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6142983 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6142984 elotuzumab provides us with the opportunity to develop and market an innovative therapy that has the potential to meaningfully address the significant unmet medical need in multiple myeloma
6142985 consistent with our companys strategy to integrate external innovation and to expand our capabilities this collaboration will further strengthen our pipeline of agents targeting hematologic malignancies which includes sprycel r and tanespimycin an hsp90 inhibitor from our recent acquisition of kosan biosciences
6142986 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb which we believe will maximize the potential benefit of elotuzumab to patients and highlight the value of our scientific discoveries and antibody technologies to the field
6142987 in addition bristol myers squibb brings extensive oncology development experience and resources and we look forward to collaborating with them to increase the scope of the elotuzumab development program moving forward
6142988 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6142989 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6142990 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can

6142992 social media club interim board members will give advice and anecdotes about how pr and branding have changed because of social media and how as an entrepreneur you sre empowered you can now market your own product or company better than any pr firm and you should this is for technical people to teach them the diy of social media as a branding tool you would be surprised how many engineers dont know this

6142995 if youre designing or programming a website or application for teens or just want to be relevant to the next generation this teen panel will give you a glimpse into how teens are using the net and cell phones find out what teens want and more importantly what they dont
6142996 everyone knows that social media has created a revolution in marketing but arent most marketers missing the point about what social media can or cannot do for them this panel will expose the horrible lies and deceptions surrounding social media marketing you will know what social media is and isnt
6142997 there is no confidence at all and no money entering the market to clean up this mess so no one can call a floor now
6142998 money poured into south locomotive as its price looked relatively attractive in such a weak market but much of the buying looks speculative and risky

6143002 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6143003 baa has argued that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist
6143004 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6143005 we fear the proposals put forward by the competition commission will lead to greater fragmentation and undermine a coherent and strategic approach to service delivery
6143006 in reality many of the travelling public have little choice as to the airports they are served by and can use we question the principle of market based solutions in this context
6143007 we are very pleased that the competition commission has recognised what is a fundamental problem for uk airports
6143008 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6143009 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6143010 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6143011 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6143012 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
6143013 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6143014 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6143015 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6143016 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6143017 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6143021 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6143022 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6143023 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6143024 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet

6143031 no es una buena idea de legalizar el pago por la donaci n de rganos ya que ese pago institucionaliza la creencia de que los ricos tienen derechos de propiedad a las partes del cuerpo de los pobres
6143032 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6143033 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6143034 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6143035 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6143036 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6143037 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6143038 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6143039 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

6143049 the apostle john gave all the tests that he did to give the true believer a biblical basis for confidence
6143050 a group of twin cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 republican national convention in st paul
6143051 weve been painted in that bad light being compared to terrorist attacks on the xcel energy center or chemical weapons or other forms of violence that we are criticized for
6143052 its important for people to know we are not as scary as people make us out to be
6143053 our tactics are not terroristic if anything i would call them empowering
6143054 all that means is you are going to stay in an intersection or a place and not leave when the police ask them to leave
6143055 essentially anything that will stop or slow down traffic in this case the traffic of the delegates could be considered a blockade
6143056 engage in nonviolent civil disobedience peacefully preventing the delegates access the xcel center
6143057 its not part of it but we do know there are people who follow the philosophy that some property supports violence and enables violence to happen
6143058 there really is an open debate about it we are just glad this debate can happen and that people can be a part of that debate
6143059 we dont want to say that we condone property violence or that we support it but we also dont want to say we are against it as well
6143060 anarchism is easily the most understood pol theory in america today so much so that newspapers use the silly phrase self described anarchists
6143061 the media says direct action is synonymous with violence that anarchism is the philosophy with the end goal of chaos and disorder
6143062 i think the key issue is people taking control of their own lives rather than offering up their compliance by being satisfied by giving someone else control of it
6143063 a lot of people out there who dont know what an anarchist is might be an anarchist themselves if they look into it a bit its more about creating an environment and community where cooperation is essentially what keeps a community running not coercion
6143064 its very community based knowing who your neighbors are anarchy doesnt mean chaos in the streets breaking windows all these misconceptions a lot of what we do is community based everyone on an equal level with one another
6143065 it isnt about creating something big but making things smaller making communities smaller revolution should be the byproduct
6143066 its essentially a huge dog and pony show sponsored by some of the worst corporations you could think of where lobbyists pay for access to high level politicians
6143067 direct action has been a part of just about any effective political movement throughout history
6143068 we dont think the political elite will stop if we ask nicely
6143069 im zweiten quartal verloren die deutschen tageszeitungen 2 2 prozent der auflage gegen ber 2007
6143070 die auflage seit jahren stur um 2 5 prozent zur ck
6143071 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
6143072 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern
6143073 enth lt wenig was neu oder berpr fbar w re

6143075 what does cosmopolitanism mean in an age where globalization is accompanied by the war on terror and where unprecedented levels of international migration are accompanied by attacks on multiculturalism and heightened border security politics what futures can we imagine for cosmopolitan civil societies as community advocates and organizations struggle against defunding and the silencing of independent voices
6143076 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
6143077 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6143078 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6143079 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6143080 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6143081 other than that i dont know a whole lot about what well be doing
6143082 ill be better briefed when i go to ottawa on the 25th

6143084 windsor has always been very supportive of msw and we worked so hard to get the product to the level it has come to today
6143085 it was mentally and physically exhaustive as well as very exciting being in such a ground breaking match especially alongside such a great partner like kowboy mike hughes i want to thank everyone for coming out and making it another historic evening for the company
6143086 theres a lot left to explore over the next several years
6143087 its an exciting time for us right now i said nearly eight years ago we were the future of maritime wrestling and we are living proof of that today mainstream wrestling entertainment is the number one pro wrestling circuit in eastern canada and the busiest in the country and i like it that way
6143088 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6143089 dont worry theres a lot of single girls out here
6143090 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6143091 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6143092 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6143093 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6143094 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6143095 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6143096 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
6143097 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
6143098 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
6143099 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
6143100 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
6143101 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
6143102 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
6143103 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
6143104 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
6143105 this is kind of an opportunity to come up with some things that might be a little outside the box
6143106 the goal of course is the development of a long term plan that provides low cost reliable sustainable power
6143107 i tried to concentrate before every attempt probably this gave the impression that i took the height easily actually it is most difficult to win at the olympic games especially such olympic games as those in beijing
6143108 at various international competitions i beat the wrestler who was my rival in the finals of the beijing olympic games three time nonetheless i had some apprehensions about the final battle no one reaches the finals without effort and no one yields victory without fierce fighting
6143109 fast food nation 2008 a consumer perspective on the fast food industry
6143110 with the average american spending 500 a year on fast food the industry clearly plays a major part in the countrys economy and we felt that our clients would benefit from gaining an in depth understanding of this segment which is a large part of consumers lives
6143111 while the state is disappointed with this decision governor palin said the state stands ready to assist the usfws to ensure that polar bear populations remain viable for decades to come
6143112 inappropriate implementation of this listing decision could result in widespread social and economic impacts including increased power costs and further increases in fuel prices without providing any more protection for the species
6143113 while the listing was a long overdue recognition of scientific reality the administration included a poison pill by ruling out the one thing that would make it meaningful an effective policy on stopping global warming itll be business as usual for oil and gas development which will put polar bears at greater risk from potential spills onshore infrastructure and disturbances not to mention will continue emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the melting of sea ice in the first place
6143114 this bill will help fill the vacuum of administration leadership by providing important protections for polar bears and their habitat
6143115 there are many polar bears so i think the americans have no right really to decide on an animal like that
6143116 theyre trying to make this a threatened listing in name only with no change in todays impacts and thats not going to fly
6143117 if the glaciers recede to the point that they disappear of course that poses a problem

6143164 this decision is a watershed event because it has forced the bush administration to acknowledge global warmings brutal impacts
6143165 its not too late to save the polar bear and well keep fighting to ensure that the polar bear gets the help it needs through the full protections of the endangered species act the administrations attempts to reduce protection to the polar bear from greenhouse gas emissions are illegal and wont hold up in court
6143166 alaskans take our public trust responsibilities for our resources very seriously and we welcome the opportunity to work with the federal agencies to address the conservation needs of these magnificent animals
6143167 we will continue to take the steps necessary to ensure that polar bears continue to thrive for generations to come
6143168 my fear is that this will lull many americans into believing that now were protecting the bears the problem is that polar bears are not endangered by human activity in the arctic and the esa listing only restricts activities up here so it quite possibly will interfere with our inupiat subsistence hunting and fishing which does not get at the problem but does impact us
6143169 but the endangered species act is a very big hammer and it could easily land on us even if the agencies dont want it to
6143170 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
6143171 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
6143172 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
6143173 the poor single mother thing is getting a bit lame now we are over that
6143174 we would always have fund raisers at her school and fund raisers at work we would have morning teas all of my department would make things and then we would force the rest of the company into buying it
6143175 a lot of people have helped us along the way
6143176 she paid for me to go and watch sally and she got a gold medal which was fantastic i would never have gone unless somebody had paid for it
6143177 i did have two jobs my full time job which i do now and then i took a second job on saturdays and sundays for a year in the lead up to commonwealth games because she needed massage and physio to maintain her body
6143178 that was 100 or 120 a week and that is why i got the extra job i was doing call centre work on the weekend it wasnt hard but i had to work every day
6143179 sally doesnt come from a broken home it is just me and her i am a single parent always have been
6143180 the race was run on a downhill track but i still came last
6143181 sal this is it no guts no glory you just have to go for it
6143182 i knew i was out in front and i said just keep going keep going
6143183 i saw lolo go down i remember it clearly i felt for her but as soon as she went down i just screamed go run and i took my chance and just went through the gap and here i am a silver medallist
6143184 i knew it was silver i knew as soon as i crossed the line
6143185 i looked at the scoreboard and thought why havent they got my name up there yet i know ive got it
6143186 it is amazing she is 21 and she has an olympic medal that was the long term plan
6143187 so trying to get two apps to support copy paste would require communication between developers

6143189 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

6143191 we dont know why theyre on the list they dont know why theyre on the list the government wont tell us why theyre on the list
6143192 how do you hope your message will change the way they think about the psalms and worshiping god

6143196 i have such bad insomnia that sometimes i still cant sleep
6143197 do you hallucinate when you take it i totally think alligators are all around me and eating my legs and last night i saw little fairies flying everywhere
6143198 sometimes i sleep walk and eat a bunch of food
6143199 the states got a huge vested interest in the outcome of that listing as far as the economics of development projects
6143200 there has to be a direct scientific line between your gas pipe and this dead bear
6143201 and frankly climate science and pollution science arent developed to the point to make that kind of connection
6143202 the project will include research methodologies such as computer modeling and perceived consensus
6143203 research shall be non biased to specific groups opinion and shall present scientifically fact based outcomes

6143270 we are puzzled and disappointed by the mbta in trying to silence the messengers that there were these problems and vulnerabilities with the pay fare system

6143288 theyve been very good at reaching out and wanting to come see us and weve welcomed them in
6143289 i think there are problems manufacturers have had in the past with technologies that dont provide consumers with the same durability or reliability that theyre used to and that can do long term damage
6143290 help american companies build batteries for plug in hybrid vehicles so we dont have to buy them from abroad
6143291 this government backed fund will help solve this problem of outsourcing
6143292 by creating an initiative right here in michigan that will accelerate the development and deployment of cutting edge vehicle technologies
6143293 size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
6143294 creating a new battery is only part of a broader challenge to solve our countrys energy crisis and dependence on foreign oil
6143295 this is such a lucrative area whoever wins this competition in the marketplace is going to be worth a lot more than a few hundred million dollars
6143296 its really the same principle thats behind a tax credit for energy efficient windows in your home
6143297 considering the cost of the initial technology consumer tax incentives help consumers get the price equation a little bit better
6143298 even if we knew all the answers right now the investment required is really quite substantial
6143299 it took roughly seven years from the time hybrids were introduced for them to sell a cumulative total of 1 million worldwide
6143300 taking into account that currently there are no plug in hybrids and that they arent expected to be available until sometime in 2010 a million plug in hybrids by 2015 appears to be aggressive
6143301 beat it kid im trying to look through this map
6143302 my whole life i wondered how it is that all things being equal two people in the same situation can be happy and unhappy respectively it puzzled me how some people gravitated toward happiness in dire situations while others who seemingly had everything were constantly depressed what made the difference
6143303 i would like to be very clear that there is nothing that we have been able to determine that would deter would be mothers from accessing health care as they have always accessed health care with the utmost confidence
6143304 its not at all clear where they would have picked it up
6143305 its time to show hrc what real solidarity looks like
6143306 transgender and labor activists united in san francisco to build the largest protest ever of hrc and we plan to show the country boston can too
6143307 hrc has spent millions of dollars on fighting losing marriage battles throughout the country but has done little to help grassroots organizers make the world a safer place for queer youth and the trans community weve had enough hrc does not speak for us
6143308 because thats not how the system works geez phoaddict youre too young to understand that
6143309 failed to adequately warn prescribing physicians of the risk of pancreatitis of measures needed to properly assess the appropriateness of prescribing the drug to certain categories of patients and of measures doctors and patients could and should take to minimize the risk
6143310 it is pretty obvious that the label change in 2007 was not adequate
6143311 we believe that amylin possessed data prior to the 2007 label revision that justified a stronger and more prominent warning than the precaution language that amylin ultimately negotiated with fda
6143312 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6143313 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards
6143314 it was a 40 ml bottle i was told later it was some lads weekend supply
6143315 i shudder to think what would have happened if alicia had taken any she could have died i contacted the pharmacy to tell them what happened and they demanded the methadone back
6143316 i intended to take it straight to a lawyer but they insisted on having it back and the criminal investigation unit was sent to my home to collect it
6143317 in the worst case scenario she could have been seriously ill and her breathing may have stopped
6143318 giving a child a dose of methadone intended for a drug addict is very bad news
6143319 we take patient safety very seriously and have robust operating procedures in place to minimize the likelihood of this type of incident
6143320 a blueprint and timeline for transformational change in canadian health care to bring about patient focused care
6143321 the vast majority of doctors across canada dont own a chain of private clinics
6143322 we work in the public system we work with patients some of whom can and most of whom cant afford to pay for their own health care
6143323 the private public rhetoric is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda
6143324 those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
6143325 when you roll your eyes at me at your sister etc it is rude and makes me her us feel bad you would not like me her us to behave this way with you and respect has to go both ways if you need some time to yourself please take it and then come and be with us again because we love your company
6143326 dying your hair purple may create some problems for you at school lets talk about what those might be and then you can make a decision
6143327 what do you hope will be filling peoples minds and hearts as they walk away from your message
6143328 how do you hope your message will change the way they think about the psalms and worshiping god
6143329 the psalms are about what life is about and life is always playing variations on a theme the human predicament the hardships of sin and suffering the lord our god who intervenes with mercies who reveals himself so that we know him and abound in hope thats so for me its so for every person gathering here to worship
6143330 theraquest is pleased to be presenting peer review data on our pain management compounds at the world congress on pain a premier scientific venue which brings together basic and clinical scientists
6143331 pharmaxis intends to file a marketing application in australia for bronchitol as soon as possible now that this study has concluded satisfactorily
6143332 bronchitol has created a great deal of interest among people suffering with bronchiectasis and we continue to respond to requests from trial participants and others interested in bronchitol we are looking forward to bringing bronchitol to the market place and are delighted this trial has concluded successfully
6143333 seventy six million americans including olympic athletes suffer from constant long standing muscle pain for which treatment is elusive
6143334 this study demonstrates a ground breaking non invasive and drug free approach that controls and may ultimately eliminate the most common cause of muscle pain
6143335 there would have to be further testing to confirm whether it is indeed a positive case or whether that initial test might have been a false positive that is apparently possible
6143336 and then we also want to determine if possible whether this is a current case of west nile virus or whether that individual was actually previously infected say in another summer and now carries the antibodies
6143337 however that doesnt mean people shouldnt take precautions it just might mean we havent trapped mosquitoes yet and theyre flying around in other areas
6143338 so we do encourage albertans to use repellant containing deet and take other precautions while theyre outside
6143339 elotuzumab provides us with the opportunity to develop and market an innovative therapy that has the potential to meaningfully address the significant unmet medical need in multiple myeloma
6143340 consistent with our companys strategy to integrate external innovation and to expand our capabilities this collaboration will further strengthen our pipeline of agents targeting hematologic malignancies which includes sprycel r and tanespimycin an hsp90 inhibitor from our recent acquisition of kosan biosciences
6143341 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb which we believe will maximize the potential benefit of elotuzumab to patients and highlight the value of our scientific discoveries and antibody technologies to the field
6143342 in addition bristol myers squibb brings extensive oncology development experience and resources and we look forward to collaborating with them to increase the scope of the elotuzumab development program moving forward

6143352 but theyre trying to encourage sellers to do more because thats where the growth is
6143353 they simply may have allowed amazon to ge so far ahead that itd be very difficult to pull back lost ground
6143354 the average consumer compares their buying experience to ebay and amazon and amazon is more trusted easier to use has better customer service and better delivery
6143355 they like ebay circa 2006 and this move will encourage displeasure from traditional sellers
6143356 but if it drives up traffic which we expect it will then effectively if they build it the sellers will come

6143359 from six hundred to go or so i think the gap really opened up and it was tough im disappointed i wanted to make the final but ill look at it tonight and tomorrow and try to decide how bad it was it certainly wasnt as planned but just wait and see
6143360 it felt good actually believe it or not i mean it felt good for ten and a half laps eleven laps actually with 500 to go i was going to make a move and the qatari beat me to it and i thought this is good ill just follow him and after about 50 or 60 metres of that that was it i just couldnt go anymore i dont know why i just wasnt good enough
6143361 ive got no excuses every heat was just as hard as the other and if i was concerned about not finishing in the top four i wouldve taken the pace up myself you didnt have to run that quick to get through on times and i backed my ability to make it in the top four and it bit me
6143362 i think i could go into races and win medals every time but it wasnt meant to be the olympics is where everyone is at their best i believe im at my best and thats where im at
6143363 its not as easy as it looks and you can be comfortable running sixty six sixty sevens which i was then an injection of pace stung me i dont know why ive got no excuses i just didnt have it semi finals are designed to get rid of the weaker runners and obviously tonight i wasnt going to get a medal anyway off of that performance so you know thats the sport
6143364 it hurts because i am a good distance runner but unfortunately its the semi finals of the olympics and they take only four thats the nature of the beast
6143365 nothing nothing nothing wrong nothing wrong ive trained as i said perfectly preparation was great i ran the race i wanted to tonight i was in the right spot all the time i was relaxed i looked good i was watching the screen to see what was going on i knew kenenisa was behind me and when the pressure came on i wasnt good enough simple

6143370 clearly theyre one of the biggest bands of all time and this tour has just proven how strong an act they are around the world they werent together that long and so much time has passed yet the music has endured
6143371 rarely do you say i think its as it should have been as opposed to i should have done it this or that way
6143372 and to keep that kind of momentum going for 16 months is a challenge but clearly a sense of urgency kicked in for people after the first go round that this would be the last
6143373 it was tough after so many years putting the parts back together but they absolutely evolved into a pretty seamless music machine
6143374 i would like to commend the canada border services agency cbsa for the speedy removal of mr giuseppe coluccio from canada this is a great example of canadas ability to coordinate efforts to combat transnational organized crime and expedite immigration enforcement proceedings as i have stated before canada is not a safe haven for individuals who have gained admission to canada by concealing their involvement in serious and organized crime
6143375 during the past decade with the massive growth of highly fortified foods nutraceuticals and functional foods supplements have been competing directly with foods and beverages
6143376 but increased media attention on obesity and other diet related health problems has prompted consumers to take more aggressive steps to avert health problems before they occur and this includes renewed attention to taking their vitamins
6143377 predictable and consistent backups are critical to our data center business objectives and silver peak empowered us to achieve these goals by maximizing throughput on our wan without requiring costly infrastructure upgrades

6143379 a guide to service delivery excellence service scheduling and routing
6143380 over forty percent of firms indicate that their customer expectations regarding speed of service have gone up in the last year and an increasing number of firms are looking to shorten their service response windows
6143381 however best in class service delivery isnt governed purely by the ability to provide a two hour response window it indicates the need to map processes related to the lifecycle of the entire service work order to have visibility into resources to execute on established processes and to equip all stakeholders with the tools necessary to adequately set and meet customer service expectations

6143389 stereoscopic gaming is inevitable its not so much a question of added realism or emersion terms that i find too nebulous to define stereoscopic 3d gaming is more fun thats why its here to stay
6143390 it is a fantastic experience when you see games like ours running with proper stereoscopic equipment
6143391 3d was meant to be seen in 3d and its great to see an organization like mtbs plant a flag firmly in the ground and state with determination that they want the real thing and you know what i think they will get it too the game creators are very pleased to have been awarded an mtbs certification for the implementation of s 3d technology in the latest update to dark basic professional we look forward to extending our native support for s 3d to our other brands including darkgdk and fps creator in the near future
6143392 the audience was thrilled with unreal tournament 3 in s 3d and we had the honor of concluding the second half of the show with the opening sequence of bioshock by 2k games in stereoscopic 3d i was repeatedly told that it was such an enveloping experience the audience was left wanting to see more when the show was finished
6143393 to make this happen we used the popular iz3d s 3d drivers along with real d technology real d is the same technology used in modern movie theaters for successful films like beowulf 3d u23d and journey to the center of the earth 3d special thanks go to rob engle of sony imageworks siggraph tdvision corp iz3d and nvidia and real d for supplying the specialized equipment needed to make this possible
6143394 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
6143395 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
6143396 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
6143397 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
6143398 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
6143399 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer

6143432 el reglamento establece que la subasta de los slots se ofertan en primera instancia a las aerol neas que ya operan en el aeropuerto y si stas no se interesan entonces la oferta aplica para el resto de l neas a reas y esto no ocurri as sino que fue una negociaci n directa entre interjet y aerocalifornia

6143434 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6143435 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6143436 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6143437 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6143438 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6143439 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6143440 its for good luck but we cant talk about it its a secret if i tell you it will ruin it

6143449 i already had a lot on my mind with a hectic work and racing schedule long periods of time on the road plus financial struggles
6143450 then something else cropped up and it prevented me from maintaining 100 focus on the track i didnt want to risk hurting myself or anyone else due to a lapse of concentration and i thank everyone for being so supportive of my decision
6143451 her rear sets are higher than mine and her stock bars are lower than my clip ons
6143452 i feel like i am riding a toy bike its still down on power and i cant seem to get any traction
6143453 i rode super defensive lines but on the last lap he passed me going into turn 1 i thought he had me but he couldnt hold his line and ran off the track
6143454 id like to thank my teammate misti for letting me use her bike and working super hard as part of the crew along with rodney denman pj felner and michael jabara they did an awesome job
6143455 i am not faithful enough to know that my god is able

6143460 the u s should immediately consult with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tiblisi ceyhan oil pipeline
6143461 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
6143462 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops
6143463 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure
6143464 what can i say theres nothing like the thrill of hunting down someone and killing em its like my hearts racing its racing but im still shooting im still getting headshot its like boom headshot boom headshot boom headshot baby
6143465 it all started with a peanut and i knew you were the one the one i wanted to spend the rest of my life with
6143466 a relationship i think is like a shark you know it has to constantly move forward or it dies and i think what we got on our hands is a dead shark
6143467 that is the first time i have ever heard it called a data cable
6143468 there is no doubt that the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6143469 how can we get the exact opposite of that guy
6143470 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0

6143475 it just started to snowball and we got momentum and it took a lot of hard work lot of phone calls lot of foot work but its been worth it so far because we got it off the ground
6143476 the strength i find is the fact this is a missing part of my life and i need to find my daughter and this is our job now if you have no other job for the rest of your life your job is to find that child that is missing
6143477 prior to the playing card program being implemented we had virtually no calls coming from correctional facilities
6143478 we now have 40 50 calls per month coming in
6143479 the people that are here live out on the streets they grew up out on the streets they know whats going on
6143480 sooner or later someone will hear someone talks it always happens whether its two days from now or five years from now
6143481 murders a big issue and kidnapping you know even though were on this side of the fence most of us dont like those things
6143482 we have a very high turnover which is very good cause we keep on getting different people in here all the time that would give some fresh ideas fresh information
6143483 we havent had anything to date but we have our fingers crossed everyday
6143484 how about some discussion from the mccain campaign about a conservative who can be counted on across the board who can help lead the country in the right direction
6143485 who can help rebuild the republican party lieberman cant do that and rebuild the conservative movement mccain nor lieberman nor ridge can do that
6143486 mccain has already seen to it that he can walk across the aisle that hes the top of the ticket
6143487 if anybody is going to attract moderates its going to be the top of the ticket guy hes not going to help himself any additional way hes going to hurt himself by putting a liberal or a liberal republican on this ticket particularly pro choice
6143488 i think mccain would like to pick him but he voted against samuel alito and is pro choice its hard to imagine the reaction at the convention and the conservatives to that circumstance
6143489 john mccain has some political capital with conservatives right now pro life conservatives but not that much and it would be very easy for him to squander with the wrong choice
6143490 at the end of the day youre only giving your private counsel to the president publicly you echo the presidents position and i think every vice president understands that and appreciates thats the rule
6143491 all i know is that my friend of 25 years john mccain is strongly and forever pro life he also believes that you shouldnt be judgmental on other peoples point of view with regard to this and some other very difficult issues and as i said before i think hell make the right choice for his vice presidential nominee
6143492 the bible says every place the sole of your foot should tread upon ill give it to you
6143493 i walked and believed that if i prayed over that ground if i walked over that ground something good would come of it
6143494 were making a lot of millionaires up here in the barnett shale area
6143495 its a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet hush money is what i call it
6143496 i wouldnt sell my front yard for a million dollars
6143497 i understand we need to pump our own oil our own gas
6143498 but we dont need to destroy our homes all of our trees and blow ourselves up whos going to be here to enjoy the gas then
6143499 gas drilling has no business in an urban area so i dont want to contribute to a company thats doing that to my community
6143500 were the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood right in the heart of the city
6143501 1 trifling minimal 2 of a fact or thing so insignificant that a court may overlook it in deciding an issue or case
6143502 so you were talking and you whipped out your dick how big is it
6143503 they may ask about it in fact let me see it
6143504 this is a tragedy anytime somebody dies anytime somebodys killed thats a tragedy but one has a right to act in self defense

6143513 has made quite a name for himself in the home building industry he began as a carpenter but now owns his own design and construction firm hes so successful in fact in the last year he was able to give a good friend a brand new home as a gift
6143514 hes so successful in fact in the last six months he gave a friend two brand new cars as a gift
6143515 to tell the truth im not very pleased how my son has turned out
6143516 for fifteen years hes been a hairdresser and ive just recently discovered hes gay
6143517 but on the bright side he must be good at what he does because his last three boyfriends have given him a brand new house two new cars and a big stock portfolio

6143526 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
6143527 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
6143528 well just try to match up the best way we can
6143529 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
6143530 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
6143531 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
6143532 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
6143533 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
6143534 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
6143535 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done

6143548 ok well i dont see the problem and heres newsflash narelle emily and eduardo arent real
6143549 whats the best way to get from here to there
6143550 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
6143551 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
6143552 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
6143553 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
6143554 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
6143555 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
6143556 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge

6143563 we are always monitoring the situation in countries where there is a high risk
6143564 snc lavalin is proud of its longstanding relationship with the people of algeria and of the many projects we have carried out together over more than 30 years

6143566 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
6143567 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
6143568 we can currently generate 10 to 100 billion red blood cells from a single six well plate of stem cells

6143583 when i first saw it i just thought that you really really enjoyed programming in java
6143584 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6143585 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector

6143623 the intent of healthcare reform was that if people were getting coverage
6143624 that appears to be happening for example from july through september 2007 the most recent period for which data is available the number of visits to hospitals and community health centers by the uninsured declined by 37 percent compared with the same period a year earlier the report said that drop translated to a 68 million savings in the pool of money the state sets aside to cover the uninsured

6143662 american families need real answers to the very real trade problems facing us americans want to remain competitive in the global market which is only possible if drastic changes are made to the way washington does business right now our failed free trade agreements are hurting families the consequences are clear randy kuhl cast the deciding vote on cafta and jobs went overseas we simply cannot afford a congressman who votes to send our jobs overseas we need a strong independent voice in congress that will stand up for working americans rather than selling out to corporate special interests we must hold our trade partners to the same standards that we hold american businesses to if we want to create and keep good jobs in america we must have fair trade policies cause and effect its as simple as that

6143674 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6143675 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6143676 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6143677 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6143678 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6143679 the key reason for the revival in early rising culture is that it teaches people to control their emotions feelings and desires
6143680 it is training in spiritual determination so that people feel motivated to contribute selflessly to a common cause
6143681 that cause can often be economic but there are clear signs that many of these movements encourage people to take pride in their country and the part they play in japanese life in some ways they are being urged to overcome their own spiritual weaknesses and replace them with nationalist pride
6143682 early rising is believed to help a person suppress their emotions or physical desires and become more morally fortified
6143683 that idea has become more potent with the revival in japanese nationalism it is no coincidence that nation wide initiatives to encourage early rising have regained momentum at a time when japanese leaders have worked towards increasing love for the nation
6143684 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
6143685 its been changing so quick its been hard as a developer to keep up with it
6143686 the more development you have the more rainfall becomes runoff the more pollutants potentially could be picked up and carried by storm water
6143687 we keep adding more and more restrictions more and more costs to me were not getting as much bang for our buck anymore
6143688 im a strong advocate of offshore drilling for both natural gas and oil in the state north carolina
6143689 it will create jobs in the long term it will help lower the price of gasoline and natural gas
6143690 in 1968 that press box was great but after 40 years it wears out
6143691 fans today expect amenities that fans werent expecting in 1968 and its our goal to give them the experience in our football stadium that they want in 2008 and beyond
6143692 one of our goals was that if you get in to the start of november and there is a couple of games the network is thinking well do we want to go shot that game up in syracuse or do we want to go down and shot wake forest down in winston salem
6143693 we want them to go you know its really easy to do a game out of bb amp t field lets go to winston salem
6143694 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6143695 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6143696 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6143697 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6143698 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6143699 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6143700 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6143701 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6143702 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6143703 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6143704 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6143705 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6143706 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6143707 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6143708 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6143709 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto
6143710 moles in the garden vendors undermine u s elections who is holding them at bay and what more can be done in 2008
6143711 citizens both private and public are beginning to realize that they can and must reassert their ownership of elections and demand transparent citizen oversight of elections
6143712 posnanski may not be the best sportswriter in america although he probably is and he may not be the best analyst in america but no mainstream sportswriter understands the numbers of baseball both what the numbers tell you and what they dont tell you as well as posnanski and no analyst comes within a country mile of pozs writing skills
6143713 if kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against washington it would have
6143714 i agree with randall jarrell that a critic who cant praise is not a critic
6143715 loves her own language more than she loves her own characters
6143716 it seems to be easier for john updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book
6143717 i would be polemicising in pieces about things i didnt like but almost never doing that in class you cant do that with students its not fair to prejudice them
6143718 that highly selective editing and shaping achieved by cutting out the chatty narrator that you get in balzac or walter scott
6143719 the result is novels of immense self consciousness with no selves in them
6143720 curiously arrested and very brilliant books that know a thousand things but do not know a single human being
6143721 these were people very interested in technique and were willing to take what they learnt and go away and apply it
6143722 this was my chance to say look you all do this thing called free indirect style its instinctive you have your own words for it heres a history of it you can go back to jane austen or even the bible and see its endemic to narrative let me give you some terminology and a brief history of it
6143723 i went through a phase where i loved everything having to do with america
6143724 then someone gave me richard fords the sportswriter when i was 21 that book just blew me away no one begins a book like that in england my name is frank bascombe i am a sportswriter
6143725 i always felt in america there was more room to move around
6143726 theres just so much space that people will by and large leave you alone to do your work
6143727 i immediately said to claire weve got to get out of here
6143728 but i know if i were to publish that novel again there are some things i would change
6143729 walking and talking das ist der grund warum wir uns hier zum sportmachen getroffen haben wir wollen laufen und irgendwann werde ich ein thema vorgeben dar ber werden wir dann reden und danach wieder laufen bis ein neues thema angestimmt wird
6143730 especially ones that give artists a chance to work on something they are all really into
6143731 i made one the last time and it was really tough
6143732 this time i said ive got my own munny points to his little boy mateo so you guys go on without me
6143733 the story i want to tell here is about a young man and what could have been a family
6143734 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6143735 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6143736 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
6143737 do you hear that sound your highness those are the shrieking eels
6143738 for all intents and purposes dead when they brought her into the hospital
6143739 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6143740 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they wrestle with these things in profound ways and so for me the goal right now should be how do we reduce the number of abortions because the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortion over the past eight years abortions have not gone down
6143741 a union between man and woman between one man and one woman
6143742 if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided
6143743 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law
6143744 not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but that he does believe in civil unions
6143745 john mccain lets face it he has a compelling biography
6143746 he is a pow and so that is what people kind of think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bush has been doing for the last 8 years
6143747 so my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics

6143764 im ecstatic man these are the olympics and im moving on
6143765 im privileged to be one of 32 to make it to the games staying alive is the name of the game and the dream everyones got in their heads
6143766 i finished second in europe and third in the worlds so there are no new faces here i knew what i had to do these are 32 of the worlds finest its so clean cut one mistake and youre out
6143767 i rate myself as one of them i came here to make a final and so i went out there to make it happen its disappointing now but i can hold my head high
6143768 my plan was to go to the front and set a very fast speed its not easy to keep these guys at bay with 150 to go i thought i had it and then a monkey jumped on my back if you lose concentration for one second you lose a stroke and the guys get half a length on you which you never get back
6143769 the last 80m i was just fighting it but i wouldnt have done anything differently i raced the way i trained i came to win this race and the guys were better than me today i was good enough to win a 900m not 1000 and that was my problem

6143773 the legislation government proposed was not to protect members of the anc from investigation but to enhance the fight against crime
6143774 it was a decision to outsource the decision making process
6143775 it may not at the time have looked specifically at the directorate of special operations scorpions but actually it was considering these options
6143776 he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of god in him
6143777 from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh if anyone is in christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come
6143778 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6143779 often many gold medalists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6143780 it was all pretty close going into the first beat and i knew exactly where i had to be but with the race being just one lap it was all a bit short and a bit rushed
6143781 because it was so close you had to go for it i went for it and i got punished a little bit
6143782 you only had to be slightly out of contention round the first mark and thats the race over really its just a shame it was one lap
6143783 this weeks been excellent really i sailed brilliantly this week and its just a shame that today went the way it did
6143784 we knew the consequence would be that wed have an increase in bad debts but many of the new accounts are interest bearing the effect is that we have maintained our operating margin at 33

6143816 we were honored to have the team from kerrville who brought hope to the people of moldova
6143817 its very important to the regents that he can be accepted by a broad consensus of the various baylor constituents and its very clear that whatever part of the baylor family one might talk with theyre pretty unanimous about one thing and thats that david garlands a fine fellow that can lead baylor during a time of transition
6143818 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
6143819 it would be enormously beneficial to public licensing for this court to state clearly a rule regarding the importance of interpreting public licenses in a manner consistent with their unique nature and federal copyright policy
6143820 in this case a user who downloads the jmri copyrighted materials is authorized to make modifications and to distribute the materials aprovided that the user follows the restrictive terms of the artistic license a copyright holder can grant the right to make certain modifications yet retain his right to prevent other modifications indeed such a goal is exactly the purpose of adding conditions to a license grant the artistic license like many other common copyright licenses requires that any copies that are distributed contain the copyright notices and the copying file

6143827 probably the majority of women who are self identified lesbians either have or do sleep with men
6143828 that puts them at risk for stds a lot of the issue too is that women who have sex with women when they do have sex with a man that partner is usually bisexual or even gay just because of the circles theyre in so that can put them at greater risk
6143829 if lesbians believe that they are at no or low risk for contracting hiv the benefits of engaging in safer sex practices would be minimal
6143830 neverender came about because the band wanted to celebrate the end of the coheed and cambria saga in a special way
6143831 we wanted to come up with an idea that paid proper respect to this phase of our career while at the same time gave our fans something truly unique and different many of these songs have never been played in front of an audience before so i think were going to be freaking out at the same time our fans are its going to be a major challenge were psyched our fans have been so loyal and amazing we figured they deserved this
6143832 were really looking forward to going deep and revisiting not only the songs but also the story
6143833 interestingly enough us going over all the old material seems to be influencing our writing of the next record which were sort of doing simultaneously and to me that seems appropro since the next story is the prequel to the amory wars

6143857 i n leaving born babies to die without treatment christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois
6143858 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6143859 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6143860 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6143861 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6143862 this is not true such measures were not already the law in illinois not according to the department of public health not according to attorney general ryan
6143863 s uch measures were not already the law in illinois
6143864 hospital officials dismissed staneks concerns she then approached the republican attorney general of illinois jim ryan who issued a finding several months later that christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois doctors had no ethical or legal obligation to treat these premature babies they had passed the bright line of birth that had effectively limited the right to life since the roe v wade decision but under the law they were non persons
6143865 d octors had no ethical or legal obligation to treat these premature babies

6143881 paris ap parisians and tourists so eagerly embraced a citywide bike sharing plan that was begun a year ago that mayor bertrand delano is proposing a four wheeled version using electric cars under the plan a driver could pick up a car on the right bank snake up the slopes of montmartre then drop it off and pay only for the minutes spent behind the wheel but cars even electric ones are already proving more divisive than bikes
6143882 the town and parish councils of these areas recognised the need to create these designated zones
6143883 they mean that in those areas police can deal with anyone misbehaving or acting in an anti social manner while drinking alcohol and can seize any in their possession

6143895 weve never viewed these games simply as 16 days of spectacular olympic or paralympic sport
6143896 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6143897 we work very closely with the ioc on a daily and hourly basis they have set the agenda on sustainable venues with sport as a bridgehead into other things
6143898 we recognise that although instinctively i think wed have been drawn to it as well
6143899 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6143900 but we can be creative we know that more people will probably come to london for the games than to other cities
6143901 i think we can deliver a fantastic olympic and paralympic games but we can do great things in the city to drive other cultural values
6143902 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium for which weve been discussing a number of anchor tenancies as well as possibly an educational legacy or even an entertainment legacy
6143903 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with the new wembley stadium are over
6143904 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6143905 weve been looking at the legacy from the very moment our teams started looking at the master plans
6143906 but the strongest legacy were witnessing at the moment is the performance of team gb
6143907 ive always felt the primary purpose of a medal is that it signifies a big british moment and big british moments in sport have to have a conversion rate
6143908 for the chris hoys of this world and our rowers and swimmers the real challenge for our governing bodies and for sport more broadly is how many people can you get into the sport off the back of that great moment
6143909 im a football fan and we have to accept that its our national sport but i do think we can really elevate the status of some of our olympic sports

6143920 the attorney stands in a fiduciary relationship with the client and should exercise professional judgment solely for the benefit of the client and free of compromising influences and loyalties
6143921 this public trust that an attorney owes his client is in the nature of a fiduciary relationship involving the highest standards of professional conduct
6143922 the fiduciary duties of disclosure at issue in this case were properly assumed and performed by each plaintiffs individually retained local counsel in pennsylvania ohio or indiana
6143923 is not at variance with the settled authorities holding that a tortfeasor with the usual joint and several liability is merely a permissive party to an action against another with like liability
6143924 it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit
6143925 a persons status as a joint tortfeasor does not make that person a necessary party much less an indispensable party
6143926 my role with fekkai is that of brand architect i will continue to lend my creative vision and drive creative efforts brand image and product development in addition to my role at the salons
6143927 of course since i made my living cutting hair that area of my life will always give me fulfillment but what really energizes me and keeps me motivated is figuring out ways to merge the creative side and the business side to be really creative in business and to constantly challenge ourselves to delight our customer in ways she never expected
6143928 it will be crucial to put maximum effort in building early bridges with the new us administration to take office next year and make sure that switzerland retains its long standing role as a privileged partner
6143929 looking ahead several crucial question marks threaten the positive development of the swiss american business relationship
6143930 the bilateral relationship between switzerland the usa the situation has not improved over the last two years
6143931 not done much to align the us swiss interest and to strengthen the swiss position as partner of choice
6143932 finally the current discussion on swiss banking secrecy rules and the troubles of a large swiss bank in the us do not help to improve the relationship

6143953 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6143954 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6143955 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6143956 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6143957 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6143958 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6143959 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6143960 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6143961 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6143962 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6143963 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6143964 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6143965 we dont know how to live on and nobody talks about it
6143966 yes sure im watching at night when i have the time
6143967 but he watches during the day and tells me all the latest news
6143968 its the 100th day after his death today and the whole family is still overwhelmed
6143969 to us nothing is interesting and nothing will ever be fun again
6143970 of course im watching its chinas games why shouldnt we watch
6143971 people have to make a living we cant just sit around all day
6143972 ive got a factory job during the day and a peach orchard to tend every evening
6143973 its peach picking season right now so there are so many things to do sure i watched the olympics opening ceremony and i care about how many gold medals china wins but frankly i have no energy for the games
6143974 we sell this to the candy makers and get a good price for this
6143975 shes a great lady and weve done so much together
6143976 i hope shes going to be ok i hope the good lord sees her through this
6143977 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6143978 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment
6143979 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6143980 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat
6143981 theres some more to go other areas to get kilinochchi mullaitivu
6143982 the troops are confident the soldiers are confident the army commander is confident
6143983 this silence is not good for the troops at all
6143984 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
6143985 you mccain can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos

6143998 a partir da faremos um debate com a petrobras com os trabalhadores com o congresso nacional e com os empres rios para saber que destino a gente vai dar a essa extraordin ria performance do petr leo no brasil

6144000 where did osama bin laden come from and why does he hate the american way of life why do the american neo conservatists want the public to believe in a world wide conspiracy of evil operating from vast underground complexes that look like a james bond film set in a world that has just witnessed the worst natural disaster in known history why are our nightmares filled with images of bearded men and dirty bombs this three part documentary gives the answers in a cool factual manner it goes back to the historic roots of both sides in this lukewarm war and shows us how eerily similar they are that is what is really scary about the war on terrorism this series is essential viewing for everyone who wants to understand the most important conflict of our time which should include you
6144001 it was a shock when i saw the picture it looks pretty clear to me and it looks so real
6144002 jordan is quite excited about it its a bit weird
6144003 das ist eine erste standortbestimmung f r die spieler und auch f r mich
6144004 es gibt keine weiteren namen auf der liste die deutsch bzw sterreichisch klingen
6144005 sie arbeitet sehr konsequent ihr vater hat ein sehr gutes system aufgebaut
6144006 im moment k nnte man sie zu jeder zeit aufwecken und sie w rde 2 03 oder 2 04 m hoch springen
6144007 es ehrt mich dass alle leute von mir gold und weltrekord erwarten aber im sport ist nichts sicher
6144008 damit wurde unsere erste vermutung aus dem jahr 2007 best tigt bei dem komplex handelt es sich um eine typische villa rustica wie man im r mischen reich einen landwirtschaftlichen betrieb der aus einem haupt und mehreren wirtschafts und nebengeb uden bestand nannte
6144009 die wiese wurde von einheimischen immer als schlossacker bezeichnet die messungen best tigen dass dies nicht von ungef hr kommt und einmal ein prunkvolles geb ude hier gestanden hat

6144013 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

6144022 der bau des neuen hauptplatzes schreitet bestens voran und wir hoffen dass wir die zeitschiene einhalten k nnen
6144023 der hauptplatz wird in zwei bereiche gegliedert vor der apotheke wird es wie bisher parkpl tze geben allerdings soll es eine besser geordnete parkaufteilung geben die anzahl der parkpl tze wird in etwa gleich bleiben
6144024 da wird es k nftig keinen verkehr mehr geben hier wird eine fixe b hne aus beton eingerichtet auf deren stufen sitzelemente f r kinder geplant sind und es wird hier auch einen brunnen geben
6144025 you can pretty much read any of these reviews to get a good impression of dinner at zenkichi
6144026 i found the bagel store after crossing the brooklyn bridge and traversing through brooklyn up to williamsburg
6144027 would you ladies mind going i have a customer here who is waiting to eat
6144028 oh williamsburg for dinner yeah i know this spot vera cruz
6144029 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
6144030 obamas success online is as much about how our society has changed how our media ecology has changed just in the past four years
6144031 in one afternoon my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with thats not necessarily obama thats the internet
6144032 but you have to give credit where credit is due obamas internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes theyve basically leapfrogged not just the clinton and mccain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters
6144033 i like to say that we at the dean campaign were the wright brothers we put this rickety thing together and got it off the ground but the folks in obamas online team are the apollo project the question is are they apollo 8 or apollo 11 if theyre apollo 11 theyre going to launch a guy and land him in the white house
6144034 this is not an extra chair this chair belongs to

6144038 not much has changed since they lived underwater and your
6144039 calls upon the parties concerned to implement the above mentioned plan in good faith
6144040 intended to rubber stamp an interpretation of the plan that we do not agree with
6144041 the victory over the georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations in russia
6144042 it was remarkable that they shot down a number of russian fighters which russia probably did not expect
6144043 we will be introducing serious changes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for example
6144044 missiles and rockets would negate the need for large scale troop deployments in the way they had to carry them out
6144045 there is no way they could say from this operation that they are capable of carrying out operations against something as sophisticated as nato forces
6144046 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6144047 often many gold medalists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6144048 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities
6144049 there is a complete dearth of facilities here compared with somewhere like australia
6144050 i think the lack of facilities here just leads to kids hanging about on the streets with nowhere to go
6144051 in terms of olympic medals the thing that probably gets you furthest is spending and focusing resources on athletes who have come forward who are doing well
6144052 norway has noted that russia has decided for the time being to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6144053 nato has not received any notification from the russians saying they are going to cut military cooperation activities
6144054 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6144055 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6144056 this is not going to happen if afghanistan is the new vietnam for the americans then it will be a problem for russia itself we are not interested in the alliances failure in afghanistan
6144057 we wish to continue the cooperation with russia as far as possible but now the conflict with russia has escalated further its a quite demanding security policy landscape thats developing
6144058 we will carefully analyze this situation there wont be any aggressive action from anyone on our side we will behave in a pragmatic manner there will definitely not be a cold war
6144059 i am planning over the next few days to give certain signals concerning military cooperation i think the signals will be received positively by my nato colleagues
6144060 without russias support in afghanistan nato would face a new vietnam and this is clear to everyone militarily nato and russia have a very good and trusting relationship
6144061 now temporary decisions are being taken on the current cooperation and not about cooperation in general these decisions are of temporary character of regional character not global character
6144062 nato rearming georgia after all that has happened would be a serious contradiction in terms between nato and the european union it would be cynical and illegitimate

6144077 we believe she was not going to be truthful and we were not going to put on the witness stand someone we didnt believe was going to give truthful testimony
6144078 since this agreement was entered in june 2007 we all agreed on what she was going to testify to and shes never wavered from that
6144079 they wanted her to change her testimony and she wouldnt
6144080 you could port it over and delete it from your memory

6144102 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6144103 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6144104 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6144105 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6144106 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6144107 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6144108 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6144109 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6144110 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6144111 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6144112 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6144113 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6144114 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6144115 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6144116 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
6144117 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
6144118 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
6144119 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
6144120 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
6144121 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
6144122 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
6144123 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
6144124 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
6144125 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was
6144126 the growing threat from swarms of jellyfish around britains coast i
6144127 it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply
6144128 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
6144129 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
6144130 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
6144131 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
6144132 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups

6144159 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
6144160 the united states of america will continue to support georgias democracy
6144161 our military will continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgia people
6144162 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6144163 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal it is not significant and it needs to increase
6144164 whether that is the beginning of a true withdrawal or some sort of token effort
6144165 its a sense of sadness because after every game last year and after the first two preseason games i had to look at mr blank and know that he deserves a winning team and he deserves a championship
6144166 i was here and couldnt make it happen its kind of sad for me leaving
6144167 now were calling these teams and kind of narrowing the scope
6144168 joe has been so productive somebody like joe and a team with a need should be a perfect fit
6144169 it was just mentally wearing him down more than physically
6144170 im disappointed that joe didnt get an opportunity to compete because of his injury in training camp and his choice not to come to otas
6144171 we really didnt get an opportunity for him to compete were going to move forward we feel very comfortable about the receiving corps that we have i wish joe the best of luck as he moves on
6144172 we couldnt change something we couldnt control the petrino thing imploded on us it wasnt the falcons fault and it wasnt joes fault it just all fell apart he planned on retiring with atlanta
6144173 you play awhile and youth comes along its their time you dont rebuild a team with veteran players i do think you can rebuild with a veteran player who can still play i know i can still play

6144178 we need the public to be our eyes and ears in the park
6144179 the fires which are suspected to be arson are happening at the worst possible time of year for the park
6144180 the one consistent item that weve seen is that all the fires are being set by the roadside
6144181 at the end of the day the owner has the final say so whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity
6144182 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asked we do the best job we can to prepare him
6144183 and if henry can be a positive influence on this football team and help us win football games and be productive as a receiver and get better as a receiver and we feel that way after the suspension is over that he has a chance to win a spot thats what brown asked me to do and thats what were going to do
6144184 once off suspension well be able to see whether he will be a positive addition to the team and go from there
6144185 but every decision made in this building is ultimately his decision we talk quite a bit once we make a decision its our decision and im going to be supportive of him just like he is of me
6144186 pretty much my last chance to prove myself which i plan on doing
6144187 i feel like mike is a really good guy and a good owner he really likes his players the little conversations i have had with mike theyve all been positive and encouraging hes telling me to continue to work hard and do the right thing
6144188 thats obvious he can help the team if he stays on the field
6144189 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6144190 those people busted their tails beyond duty helping him out
6144191 he has found the end of the rainbow three or four times
6144192 weve got to play its not our team mr brown can do what he wants to do
6144193 im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6144194 he doesnt have to prove anything to us because the commissioner will kick him out of the league for another transgression
6144195 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6144196 should they initiate the draft you know the age is 18 if we can go out and fight and die for our country and you cant have a beer that doesnt make a lot of sense to me
6144197 whether the drinking age is 18 or 21 i dont think it really matters because if people are going to abuse alcohol theyre going to do it regardless of the law
6144198 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6144199 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
6144200 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6144201 we also need to keep in mind that alcohol related traffic fatalities reached a ten year high in 2006
6144202 theyve been going up in the last ten years we also need to keep in mind that peer reviewed research shows more than 1 000 lives of 18 to 24 year olds are lost each year off the highways to alcohol the evidence is not all on one side of this debate and we need to consider all of those data and consider whether 21 is in fact serving us well
6144203 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6144204 we know the 21 minimum age drinking law does work
6144205 theres 48 highly backed studies to back the fact that the law does work it saved over 1 000 young peoples lives every year for the last 24 years why would we go back we tried this in the 70s and 80s it simply did not work then alcohol related fatalities went up in that age group
6144206 college presidents dont want this passed down to them from college presidents who are being irresponsible
6144207 we know that people continue to drive for instance after a drunk driving conviction
6144208 theyll simply drive without their license up to 75 percent of convicted drunk drivers continue to drive why would we think that 18 year olds would drive or not drive you know its not the solution
6144209 the presidential statement simply says that based on our own experience and 24 years of this law on the books we believe theres evidence to show that 21 is not working that it has had unintended consequences and that it is well past time to open public debate about all of the effects of this law on our campuses and elsewhere
6144210 removing that 10 percent incentive is the surest way to resume the debate that needs to take place
6144211 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
6144212 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6144213 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6144214 are there enough of these confident nonconformists out there for us
6144215 everyone who knows me knows i can be a jokester but i guess i took it too far
6144216 i never meant to say anything rude about michael i am 100 percent sorry for what i said i take full responsibility for it
6144217 she wanted to pick him up according to her the chemistry was instant they ended up sleeping together that same night
6144218 john mccain is pro life always has been pro life and his administration will be pro life and anyone who he picks as vice president will respect those views
6144219 pro life policies and that his running mate would share
6144220 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day mr
6144221 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
6144222 can you at least say whether there are certain positions that are non negotiable for your vice presidential pick
6144223 i cant talk about it because if i do i would get down a slippery slope he said
6144224 i think i made it very clear saturday night that i have a pro life record that i have pro life policies and my administration will have pro life policies
6144225 im just going to tell you from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades now she said
6144226 life applies to those who are not born as well as those are born
6144227 can rally around in the future or whether it would be someone
6144228 being a little better than the mediocre public school down the street aint what we mean
6144229 the vehicle was flipped upside down about 15 meters from the hole itself which was about 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep
6144230 it was a combination of challenges the depth of injury the extent of surface area involved and then finding donor tissue to cover
6144231 they took a full thickness from my stomach basically i got a tummy tuck which was kind of nice but they took that full thickness and put it on my head and about 80 percent took
6144232 my wife and i our relationship theres not a whole lot of husband and wife these days
6144233 he cant really fix meals he cant take a shower anymore by himself
6144234 i cant play catch with my son and i cant go shopping with the girls very easily so theres a lot of changes the kids have gotten more used to now
6144235 but still they wish the old dad was here which i understand i wish he was here too
6144236 theyre not eligible for the same benefits as amputees are because they havent lost a limb but in my husbands case he lost the use of his left arm so whether its there or not there he cant use it
6144237 i watched my daughter go to prom last week she looked beautiful it was a really nice moment that i could have missed

6144251 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
6144252 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
6144253 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
6144254 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
6144255 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
6144256 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
6144257 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you

6144415 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6144416 since 2005 rihanna has been sponsored by the likes of jc penny samsung covergirl secret venus breeze etc and has gone on two major tours most recently label mate kanye wests
6144417 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years a lot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made was through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
6144418 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had the intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
6144419 this brought the hype back for rihanna in the companys new york office the majority of the official s o s video was funded by samsung because the record label was only willing to put up a small amount once s o s picked up digitally and at radio def jam agreed to fund the rest of her album jordan instantly got a video shot to unfaithful he negotiated with video director anthony mandler to drop his price and would be given more videos from rihanna in return
6144420 then they shot we ride which was an extremely cheap video to create break it off was released as a third album but again def jam was unhappy with the sales of her album a girl like me and refused to shoot a video
6144421 at this point rihanna was opening up for the pussy cat dolls in europe she was making 30 000 a show but she didnt see any of that money because it was needed to fund her next album
6144422 when the albums first week numbers came in at less than 150 000 the label was shocked
6144423 jordan was noticing that dont stop the music was picking up so he persuaded the label to support it at radio in the u
6144424 take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
6144425 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now
6144426 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name

6144528 i would like to point out a real limitation in java related to floating point calculation which for such a rich language is really unfortunate we cannot use doubles or floats if we want exact calculations say in a financial app because of underlying binary floating point representation so we should use bigdecimals right but as you know its immutable so for every bit of calculation we are creating new objects just for fun for strings one can understand the reason behind immutability that is we do not want to create redundancy in memory for same string literals and avoid unnecessary garbage but for bigdecimal and even for wrappers making them immutable is actually encouraging garbage as every add subtract operation will result in a new object

6144583 the contrast between biblical faith and this contemporary spirituality is that between two entirely different ways of looking at life and god nygren some years ago used the greek words for two different kinds of love eros and agape to characterize these worldviews the movement of eros spirituality is upward its essence its drive is the sinner finding god the movement agape by contrast is downward it is about god finding the sinner eros spirituality is the kind of spirituality is the kind of spirituality which arises from human nature and it builds on the presumption that it can forge its own salvation agape arises in god was incarnate in christ and reaches us through the work of the holy spirit opening lives to receive the gospel of christ saving death

6144590 mufg will not need to raise capital the deal will not cause dilution and we estimate a positive eps impact
6144591 the financial impact of the transaction is limited to the deduction from capital of the cash payout
6144592 if mufg want to quickly inject capital its much easier to do it if unbc is a 100 subsidiary
6144593 such a strategy is far easier than hostile m amp a yet it pumps up the top line and shareholder returns plus it enables the bank to puts its capital to work in an efficient way
6144594 buying an investment banking entity to service japanese companies in the us is the priority but failing that buying some retail banking businesses is an option a privatised unbc could act as a regional expansion vehicle

6144619 unfortunately the reporter for the daily mail in the uk only takes davenport lyons side of things
6144620 as for as the cheap assed pinball game its still owned by someone who was selling it and her actions did not only breal the law but did cause a loss for that person if she wanted her friends to be able to play it then she should have bought legitimate copies and send them to her friends

6144656 the focus remains on freddie mac and fannie mae and the financials in general
6144657 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college
6144658 at some point if its going to totally put a familys finances in jeopardy rationality needs to factor in
6144659 i expected the type of criticism i would get and decided it was worth it
6144660 the principal goal of the legislation which we are totally supportive of is transparency

6144666 it lets them know that they can be productive that they arent useless scum of society this is rehabilitation already
6144667 i dont fear them and they listen i think it is easier to teach them than other people you really see how hard they try to get it right
6144668 i like dancing it is a way we get to show the world that even if we ended up in prison we are not totally damaged people

6144672 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them they want to believe were in the eighth or ninth inning but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
6144673 there is a lot of uncertainty with what happens in terms of capital raising and a lot of investors are in a wait and see mode
6144674 from a gse perspective as long as they get funding it does not matter at what price as they will just pass it on with higher mortgage rates
6144675 the army has consistently expressed a strong desire to enter into cleanup agreements for its remaining national priorities list sites at fort meade md and redstone arsenal ala
6144676 having put together the list over the past two years we contacted those folks directly
6144677 and that lowered the number of broker transactions that would have been done once we move through the list and exhaust the list we will continue to enhance the relationship with the prince georges brokers
6144678 i feel that we should get some of the listing business not just at national harbor but at woodmore towne centre at glenarden places where there is a public private partnership where county funds are being used
6144679 the idea behind economic development in the county is for other businesses that are in the county to benefit from the project
6144680 board does not solicit business for members we are all competitors
6144681 our ability to service the jets in parts of the world where were selling still lags our ability to sell and manufacture them so we wanted to change that

6144683 i cant keep telling people bring your plane to savannah to get it worked on
6144684 we sell gulfstream jets in russia china and india and we need to be present there
6144685 this is adding another leg onto what general dynamics has done in business jet aviation
6144686 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
6144687 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
6144688 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock
6144689 what were learning is that the financial crisis is far from over and that earnings estimates are probably too high
6144690 when oil and the stock market go down together you know theres real reason to worry
6144691 we are still in the throes of the credit crisis
6144692 theres risk that fannie mae and freddie mac may require capital from the government

6144694 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
6144695 we are back to struggling again in the financial sector particularly
6144696 underneath some of that is just concern about the overall global economic slowdown
6144697 they dont excuse russias brutal behavior in georgia or toward its other neighbors behavior that began long before bush took office americas moral standing is irrelevant in judging russias actions
6144698 saakashvili may have acted rashly and he may have flaws as a leader but
6144699 a knowledge of the past prepares us for the crisis of the present and the challenge of the future
6144700 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6144701 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6144702 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6144703 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
6144704 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6144705 see if it can be fixed before you do anything rash
6144706 we have to show him that hes not that you and the baby rank above him in the hierarchy
6144707 i mean i know we will be happier without the growling but would eddie be happier in a home without kids am i just making him miserable
6144708 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6144713 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6144714 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6144715 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6144744 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6144745 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6144746 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6144747 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6144748 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6144749 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6144750 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6144751 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6144752 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6144753 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6144754 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6144755 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6144756 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6144757 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6144758 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6144759 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6144760 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6144761 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6144762 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6144763 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6144764 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6144765 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6144766 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6144767 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6144768 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6144769 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6144770 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6144771 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6144772 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6144773 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6144774 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6144775 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6144776 conseguir reinventar produtos servi os ou o pr prio jeito de fazer neg cios uma cobran a t o comum nas empresas quanto a press o pelo aumento de vendas e lucros a cada trimestre
6144777 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6144778 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6144779 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6144780 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6144781 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6144782 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
6144783 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6144784 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word
6144785 i didnt realise at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
6144786 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
6144787 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states
6144788 we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
6144789 the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6144790 wir sind die profis und k nnen alles tun alles und sind zu allem bereit
6144791 na ja die anderen k nnen zwar auch was aber seien sie blo vorsichtig
6144792 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6144793 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6144794 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6144795 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6144796 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6144797 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6144798 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6144799 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6144800 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6144801 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6144802 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6144803 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6144804 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6144805 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6144806 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6144807 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6144808 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6144809 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6144810 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6144811 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6144812 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6144813 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6144814 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6144815 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6144816 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6144817 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6144818 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6144819 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6144820 sua volta prefeitura a melhor coisa que pode acontecer a s o paulo neste momento
6144821 o povo de s o paulo precisa de um bom prefeito o que um bom prefeito um homem que tenha credibilidade como primeira condi o compet ncia e que seja leal geraldo alckmin tem essas caracter sticas por isso voto nele
6144822 eu e serra sab amos que era preciso fazer algo para melhorar o atendimento sa de
6144823 vote em quem n o tem rabo preso e tem coragem de mudar vote no cora o valente
6144824 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6144825 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6144826 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6144827 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6144828 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6144829 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6144830 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6144831 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6144832 we have a great event organized and are ready to rock but need the fuel to fire it
6144833 only the strong can be kind the weak must be cruel
6144834 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavor for spammers

6144840 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6144841 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6144842 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6144843 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6144844 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6144845 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6144846 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6144847 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6144848 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6144849 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6144850 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6144851 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6144852 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6144853 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6144854 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6144855 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6144856 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6144857 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6144858 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6144859 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6144860 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6144861 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6144862 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6144863 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6144864 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6144865 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6144866 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6144867 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6144868 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6144869 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6144870 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6144871 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6144872 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6144873 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6144874 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6144875 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6144876 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6144877 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6144878 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6144884 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6144885 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6144886 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6144887 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6144888 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6144889 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6144890 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6144891 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6144892 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6144893 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6144894 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6144895 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6144896 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6144897 this is a planning took where all things are going
6144898 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6144899 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6144900 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6144901 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6144902 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6144903 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6144904 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6144905 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6144906 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6144907 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6144908 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6144909 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6144910 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6144911 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6144912 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6144913 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6144914 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6144915 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6144916 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6144917 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6144918 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6144919 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6144920 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6144921 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6144922 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6144923 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6144924 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6144925 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6144926 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6144927 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6144928 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6144929 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6144930 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

6144933 were going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal
6144934 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states
6144935 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
6144936 what was up with the weird message you sent me last night
6144937 peace in the region should be re established and guaranteed so that no idiotic ideas ever come to anyones head that is the main task for the russian federation at the present moment
6144938 the presence of military forces on the georgian territory was wrong i believe we have to realise the plan of the six principles as soon as possible so that russian troops can leave the territory of georgia
6144939 georgia and ukraine could be members of nato we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
6144940 some of russias actions were not proportionate russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia
6144941 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work it is sad for europe and for everyone living on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic we will continue to work on this and we are ready to continue discussions with all participants but it is clear this decision will not create any sort of calm
6144942 we would not like of course to see relations deteriorate in the long or short term we have always based our position on full fledged development of relations with the eu separate eu states the united states and other states we are living in a fragile world and it is obvious that any worsening of the international environment will only serve the interests of the most reactionary forces those who dont understand this are blind we dont want to cut relations with anyone but nevertheless ill tell you that we have fulfilled and will continue to fulfil our peacekeeping mandate if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
6144943 i think in such a complicated and difficult conflict it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
6144944 no one is rejecting the principle of territorial integrity as one of the main principles of international law unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
6144945 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but it is not our position which matters the problem is that ossetians and abkhazians themselves do not trust anyone but russian peacekeepers

6145059 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

6145061 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
6145062 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
6145063 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
6145064 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
6145065 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
6145066 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care

6145085 and with todays technology we can achieve incredible speeds using only wind power

6145107 there is a historic suspicion that african americans are less patriotic
6145108 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
6145109 shanaze wants to go to see if she can develop herself into a track sprinter with a view of maybe going to london and competing on the track as well as the bmx
6145110 shes young cyclists like her come into cycling and think about where they are going next
6145111 shes made it in bmx what does the future hold for her which is exceptional its to win the bmx gold medal in london which would be a great feat but for her to win other gold medals to be a multi medallist which lets face it is the way things are going then she needs to hone her skills in other events

6145119 the purpose is to offer collective penance and ask for the help of allah at this critical juncture
6145120 dont try to tell me that there is no economic blockade i say that an embargo exists
6145121 i know the government of india very well i have worked while staying within the government of india
6145122 if the valley would have had borders with china kashmiris would have tried to march to chine for trade
6145123 how do you explain the deployment of the army on the srinagar jammu highway if there is no blockade
6145124 the team would prepare a detailed note for the pmo prime ministers office taking into account the perceptions carried by the team its visit to the valley
6145125 but the bjp and other parties have incited hooligans and anti social elements to intimidate and torment minorities in a conspiracy to impair the traditional amity between the two communities by acts like the blockade which could have disastrous consequences
6145126 the strategy is to mobilize and organize communal forces throughout the country to consolidate the bjps vote bank and all this is being done in the name of kashmir

6145206 weve been getting multiple offer situations in our midtown markets
6145207 my heart found its home long ago in the beauty mystery order and disorder of the flowering earth
6145208 my special cause the one that alerts my interest and quickens the pace of my life is to preserve the wildflowers and native plants that define the regions of our land to encourage and promote their use in appropriate areas and thus help pass on to generation in waiting the quiet joys and satisfactions i have known since my childhood
6145209 some may wonder why i chose wildflowers when there are hunger and unemployment and the big bomb in the world well i for one think we will survive and i hope that along the way we can keep alive our experience with the flowering earth for the bounty of nature is also one of the deep needs of man
6145210 i have always been a natural tourist lyndon used to say i kept one foot in the middle of the big road wherever i go in america i like it when the land speaks its own language in its own regional accent
6145211 though the word beautification makes the concept sound merely cosmetic it involves much more clean water clean air clean roadsides safe waste disposal and preservation of valued old landmarks as well as great parks and wilderness areas
6145212 the environment is where we all meet where all have a mutual interest it is the one thing all of us share it is not only a mirror of ourselves but a focusing lens on what we can become
6145213 a i look back across a span of more than seven decades im grateful for the joy that nature has given me and for the lifetime of experiences that led me to believe that i might repay a part of the debt ive incurred for beauty enjoyed
6145214 wildflower landscapes can help us save water wildflowers also can save time and maintenance money they may even bring money to cities and states wildflower trails and flower festivals improve local pride and bring in tourists but as ive said we need to know much more about how and when and where to plant them to get reliable predictable consistent results we need that knowledge if we are to preserve wildflowers and to choose them as complements to traditional manicured landscaping
6145215 do you weep for the present well know that the days to come will be worse still thats why they made this war to poison the womb of time so that the present would give birth to monsters instead of hope they have stolen so much from you that not even your dreams are your own

6145217 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6145218 if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it
6145219 but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds
6145220 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster

6145527 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6145528 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6145529 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6145530 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6145531 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6145532 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6145533 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6145534 i know you are worried that i will be late to pick you up after school but dont worry i will be there
6145535 i will pick you up at 3pm in carpool lane
6145536 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6145537 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
6145538 i thought that it was really odd that someone would be using it that way
6145539 the negatives defiantly outweigh the positives ive never heard of it used that way
6145540 theres probably others that were treated for similar things but at the time they were treated the circumstances hadnt been brought out yet
6145541 when we first started receiving the information that these pills had been out at least two other victims had been treated
6145542 it was not my grandfather they were after he was too respected breaking into his home late at night and holding a gun to his head was just a way to speed finding their victim
6145543 the haints didnt like his teaching us to love books
6145544 there were always lines of armed white men hooded and robed so no one could see the evil inside to this day i cannot stand to have white sheets in my home
6145545 doing what we had to do to get from day to day enjoying gods blessing of the beautiful land warmed by the hot sun
6145546 the numbers of people riding each truck and the names of the drivers on those trucks were carefully noted then each person picking alone would have his or her name written down families picking together would have their cotton tallied together
6145547 finally we would choose the number of rows we planned to pick that day
6145548 the best pickers would gather 300 or more pounds a day it was enough to earn them as much as 10 almost double the pay of a salaried black man with a good job
6145549 i had the strength and the rhythm of a good picker and could clear as much as 200 pounds
6145550 for me there was always something beautiful about the cotton fields and that day started as no exception on that peaceful morning in the cotton fields as i found myself in the midst of a group of neighbors all talking and picking i saw a boy from my school hanging back
6145551 my friends mother was annoyed though i did not know why
6145552 the rider noticed my classmate because he came over on his horse he was a big man with a large straw hat on his head and a pump action shotgun in a scabbard hanging against the saddle
6145553 why arent you working more nigger the rider asked my friend
6145554 the boy just looked at the man on horseback he didnt want to be in the fields that day he didnt want his mother telling him what to do and he certainly didnt want to have to deal with this white man
6145555 dont you have no manners nigger the rider asked nigger nigger
6145556 most southern whites were only comfortable with a subservient black man that was just the way things were done and you could die for breaking the rules
6145557 just say yes sir to the man his mother whispered pleadingly
6145558 i was a few feet away trying to watch without getting caught
6145559 the rider never said he wanted the boy to say the words yes sir but we all knew the rules it was the way things were in the south
6145560 suddenly there was bedlam some people stared in shock some were screaming several rushed to help the boy who was rapidly bleeding to death his head cradled on his mothers lap
6145561 the rider held the horses reins with one hand the shotgun with the other
6145562 the men who had been picking with us in the fields gently lifted the dying boy onto one of the sacks and carried him back to a truck he was dead by the time they laid him on the hot steel bed and his weeping family gathered around him the rest of us climbed back into the other trucks to go home there would be no more picking cotton in that field that day
6145563 you begin to hate white people all white people you only know the hate that has been turned against you you come to understand the terrible things people do when they feel desperate when there is no hope we were so young and hurt so much and tomorrow had never been a better day
6145564 it was a police officer who went too far for carl and me we were driving along third street in downtown memphis carl was wearing his dress blues the handsome formal marine uniform everyone in the country knew by sight he was being discharged and needed to take care of some paperwork
6145565 finally we could move on carl was near to tears why do white folks hate black folks we asked each other we were hardworking people we sent our children to school to learn to be good citizens we went to church we didnt bother anyone yet nothing we did could stop the hate
6145566 there was no one in pursuit of us on our trip north except the memories of past horrors we witnessed and would never be able to fully erase
6145567 our pharaohs army was invisible it was all the white people who hated us
6145568 i remembered miriam and how she took a tambourine when she knew she was safe she and the women who rejoiced still had to journey through the desert our promised land was just across a short bridge miriam and the other women sang
6145569 i turned back looking at the road we had traveled
6145570 reality of living in cleveland was a shock i always knew the rules in memphis and marked tree we all knew who might hurt us when they thought we did something wrong
6145571 there were no rules when i came to cleveland except the understanding among our people that superior was the mason dixon line
6145572 black people couldnt walk or ride through mayfield road and the murray hill area without being beaten or worse
6145573 the hough ghetto had once been an area of mostly single family homes
6145574 i first got into politics to try and protect my neighbors from the developers the greedy politicians the bad landlords and the poor public schools i fought to help old people keep the homes they owned and lived in i fought to give school children a free choice instead of seeing them go to second rate schools used as training grounds for new teachers and dumping grounds for bad ones
6145575 i hear you and some little old ladies from your church were out confronting the drug boys last night theyre dangerous mrs lewis you could get hurt or killed doing that
6145576 when youre doing your job we wont have to be there
6145577 ill get my rest when the lord is done with me here
6145578 give me a party with my close friends and i can dance on the table
6145579 i learned to cope by laying in the hammock and writing
6145580 introvert power why your inner life is your hidden strength
6145581 it takes living it to be able to write it
6145582 give me a party with my close friends and i can dance on the table
6145583 i learned to cope by laying in the hammock and writing
6145584 introvert power why your inner life is your hidden strength
6145585 it takes living it to be able to write it
6145586 i have nothing against self publishing but i think people are too intimidated to go the traditional route
6145587 the avenue is very simple you need a book proposal
6145588 author of five books will share her tips for getting published
6145589 take that book right back out and put it in your desk you cant take that home with you
6145590 in this case we involved the public and there was a level of anxiety there in the community
6145591 we now want to let them know weve made progress in this case we feel strongly that we have the individual involved but we are asking the public to still be on the alert
6145592 all of these incidents happened in the late evening or early morning hours of the day
6145593 acne is a vicious cycle it can be a huge stressor for teenagers which can often lead to more acne breakouts
6145594 emotional stress has been linked to severe acne episodes and certain factors in a teens life such as getting ready to go back to school trying out for a sports team or fitting into a social niche can cause anxiety and distress i recommend that my younger patients schedule a back to school visit to gain control of their skin before these emotional factors affect them
6145595 like most teens i went though a very awkward stage of my life where i wasnt comfortable in my own skin
6145596 our goal at my beauty camp is to teach girls about how to take care of themselves from the inside out and provide them with the necessary tools to boost their self esteem the camp is a great opportunity for girls to attend right before the school year when insecurities can be at their highest
6145597 being beautiful is expressing yourself you have to love yourself and other people and you have to take care of your body and be healthy its knowing that you have natural beauty
6145598 im excited to attend my beauty camp i think its going to be a great way to learn about the latest beauty and health tips discover more about myself and make new friends
6145599 brian performs at church most sunday mornings when you hear him sing and see see him play youd never guess fear almost stopped him from taking the stage
6145600 id get sick to my stomach especially around my girlfriend i could play in front of a thousand people but when it came to talking to people id get nervous it was a tough thing and an embarrassing thing
6145601 when you always have that fear that youre going to get sick you think about what youre going to eat and where you can escape
6145602 its not me its a sickness some people have sinuses i have an anxiety disorder
6145603 theyre all going through the same thing probably the same situations instead of trying to cover it up this is a young man willing to say here i am and god accepts me just like this

6145627 there are probably things in the final film that are in spite of what i hoped to say they may even contradict what i had on my mind which is not that deep
6145628 if russia continues to keep these conflicts frozen unresolved and continues to prevent georgia from fully exercising its territorial integrity should georgia be disallowed when it comes to being invited to join nato just because of that
6145629 its got to be a consensus decision by nato theres a lot of other factors in play right now
6145630 i had a boob job there it is i finally said it i wanted to come clean that i had my boobs done in my 20s because people falsely write that i ve had all those things done
6145631 i ve had the two procedures that probably every other woman in hollywood has had done

6145633 i hope you dont have too much indigestion after eating
6145634 the aim is to create a grand square of the highest quality and design a beautiful cosmopolitan space within the core of our medieval city where families and friends can linger in inspirational surroundings
6145635 what we envisage is a european style cafe culture with the medieval setting complemented by sensitive landscaping

6145646 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6145647 if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it
6145648 but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds
6145649 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6145650 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
6145651 there have been a number of well documented case histories of adults and children who drowned in very cold water even trapped under ice for hours and were successfully revived many hours later
6145652 of course this is used routinely in modern cardiac bypass
6145653 there is some historical precedent for how this might work
6145654 many years ago some babies were put into ice water at birth to try to revive them there were reports that this actually could be effective and that some children survived
6145655 i am convinced that cold therapy helped this young man
6145656 although i read the report i still find it hard to believe
6145657 usually cool temperatures increase the likelihood of death in extremely preterm infants
6145658 probably the doctors could not feel a pulse heard few or no heartbeats and saw that the baby was not moving now it can be very difficult to be sure about death in such immature babies right after birth i have seen cases in my own institution of mistaken diagnosis

6145661 hoy no tenemos una respuesta definitiva y queremos que las buenas intenciones de la ministra se transformen en una decisi n pol tica queremos una propuesta de sueldos para docentes no buenas intenciones

6145663 hay que ver las posibilidades financieras en funci n de dar respuesta a demandas que son urgentes y no perder calidad en la estructura salarial
6145664 es algo que hubi semos querido poder evitar y esperamos que no se repitan
6145665 hablar del 10 de la masa salarial de la provincia para el sector educativo ser an 275 millones de pesos una suma importante para redistribuir entre los trabajadores de la educaci n ahora si se est hablando de un 10 del b sico de un docente ser an 65 pesos una cifra absolutamente irrisoria

6145686 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6145687 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6145688 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6145689 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6145690 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting this is finally good news for afghanistan
6145691 and of course i did but it look longer than i thought
6145692 one theory is that hawks in both the us and russia wanted it to happen to justify their own positions as one storyline goes dick cheney encouraged the georgians telling them that they would soon be welcomed into nato and that the us would protect them emboldened the georgians try to take back south ossetia the russians respond harshly and play the bad guy and then the us responds with heated rhetoric but not military action giving the republican party a hot button issue for the presidential race the hawks in the kremlin dont mind obliging they would prefer mccain in the white house to obama

6145703 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
6145704 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
6145705 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
6145706 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
6145707 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
6145708 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
6145709 because americas relations with a host of countries are intricately tied to fannie and freddie
6145710 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
6145711 trouble at fannie mae and freddie mac stirs concern abroad
6145712 this is their financial system they had demanded paper money federally insured bank deposits and a heavy governmental hand in the distribution of credit and now they have them the populist party might have lost the elections in the hard times of the 1890s but it won the future they got their government controlled money the federal reserve opened for business in 1914 and their government directed credit fannie mae and freddie mac in 1971 they got their pure paper dollar so today the fed can print all the dollars it deems expedient and the unwell federal mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac combine to dominate the business of mortgage origination
6145713 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
6145714 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
6145715 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
6145716 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
6145717 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions
6145718 these twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our american institutions
6145719 the number of advances wasnt increasing exponentially i hadnt seen as many as i had expected not in any particular area just generally
6145720 that the average individual innovator is having a smaller and smaller impact
6145721 i am in two minds about this biologists have abandoned the idea of progress we just are where we are but humanity is so far in advance of anything that has gone before that it seems to be a qualitative leap
6145722 and i increasingly am persuaded that it is then we will have the technology to deal with it
6145723 torture is a matter that has always been unacceptable beyond discussion lets not pretend those days are passed we now have ticking bomb terrorists and its an empirical fact that every civilised democracy would use torture in those circumstances
6145724 terrorism is a major step backwards in civilisation hitler was a major step backwards sometimes we have to step backwards too to combat such things but progress happens in other areas a generation now growing up may have to accept more security measures and less privacy but in other areas like sexual conduct we are making progress i dont think overall we are making a step back
6145725 the implications are mind blowing civilisation faces the sharpest and perhaps most violent dislocation in recent history
6145726 market based panic will within a few days drive prices skyward
6145727 and the market will become paralysed at prices too high for the wheels of commerce and daily living

6145741 the contaminated property causes a risk to the people that live in the general vicinity
6145742 back when these industrial businesses closed there was no reason to believe the area would be contaminated or that it could be dangerous with new technology we know that these areas must be cleaned up to protect the integrity of the land and to open the possibilities for new business
6145743 the fact that states all over the nation are introducing and considering legislation like this shows the importance of cleaning up brownfields
6145744 restoring contaminated property may bring more business and economic development to areas with a struggling economy this new law has so many benefits and i am proud that i can say i was the house sponsor

6145766 this matter is being appealed by the dpp and i will await the outcome of that appeal

6145784 clearly theyre one of the biggest bands of all time and this tour has just proven how strong an act they are around the world they werent together that long and so much time has passed yet the music has endured
6145785 rarely do you say i think its as it should have been as opposed to i should have done it this or that way
6145786 and to keep that kind of momentum going for 16 months is a challenge but clearly a sense of urgency kicked in for people after the first go round that this would be the last
6145787 it was tough after so many years putting the parts back together but they absolutely evolved into a pretty seamless music machine

6146079 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6146080 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way

6146082 rachel is unbelievably talented and brilliant her breadth and depth of knowledge of politics and news is astonishing and im so excited to give her a place to really showcase what she can do
6146083 weve established msnbc as the place for politics and the destination for viewers who want the smartest take on the days developments adding rachel into our primetime lineup makes perfect sense
6146084 ive loved working with msnbc and being asked to host my own show is an amazing opportunity
6146085 when dan served as general manager he really laid the groundwork for msnbcs success today with ratings growing 62 percent under his watch
6146086 dan is the best legal analyst in the business our primetime focus is now politics so this move will enable dan to focus on what he does best
6146087 putting my g m hat back on i think this is absolutely the right call i look forward to my future success at nbc news
6146088 tendency to lecture on the power of faith and religion and on the demerits of science
6146089 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues
6146090 while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank but fair they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask this includes pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights
6146091 physicians responsibility is to place the needs of the patient first so there will be times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical services they require
6146092 should be aware that decisions to restrict medical services offered or to end physician patient relationships that are based on moral or religious belief may contravene the code and or constitute professional misconduct
6146093 why does cote divoire have 76 religions while norway has 13 and why does brazil have 159 religions while canada has 15 even though in both comparisons the countries are similar in size
6146094 religion diversity is the highest where disease diversity is also the highest and the lowest where disease diversity is also the lowest
6146095 our analysis suggests that the nature of religion needs to be reconsidered
6146096 period of religious and spiritual rejectionism was eating at the heart of medicine
6146097 to those who viewed medicine as more than just a vocation this reality was profoundly unpleasant
6146098 must learn to attend to both the body and the soul
6146099 thou has created the human body with infinite wisdom ten thousand times ten thousand organs hast thou combined in it that act unceasingly and harmoniously to preserve the whole in all its beauty the body which is the envelope of the immortal soul they are ever acting in perfect order agreement and accord almighty god thou hast chosen me in thy mercy to watch over the life and death of thy creatures i now apply myself to my profession support me in this great task so that it may benefit mankind for without thy help not even the least thing will succeed
6146100 we need today more than ever a common language a common intention to communicate and listen across differences in worldviews cultures classes religions and species
6146101 for our children and for the children of all species
6146102 as rabbis from various branches of judaism we the undersigned urge public school boards to affirm their commitment to the teaching of the science of evolution
6146103 to the point where i would be inclined to go so far as to interchange the words faith and ignorance
6146104 much easier to write on the clean slate of an ignorant but open minded person than to have to first erase preconceived notions that run counter to the criticality needed to develop a scientific understanding of the world around us
6146105 direct observation shows that faith does not obstruct scientists from doing science
6146106 both indirectly in terms of the choice of school curricula and directly since faith by its very nature runs counter to a scientific way of thinking
6146107 the theological tradition known as open theology a k a open theism openness theology has gained wide attention in christian theological circles since the 1990s reduced to its bare bones open theology affirms that 1 god uniquely exemplifies love 2 love is the human ethical imperative 3 god and creatures enjoy free and mutually influencing relations 4 and the future is open and not settled with regard to the fourth point open theology affirms that god knows everything that may possibly happen in the future but god does not know with absolute certainty what free creatures will actually choose to do
6146108 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
6146109 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
6146110 people somehow create an artificial barrier between science and religion i see god and his inspiration in our scientific curiosity i havent seen anything in my work as a scientist that disrupts or causes me to lose faith in god or his work in my life
6146111 especially a great comfort to me when i was actually preparing for these space flights it was good to step aside from all the technical stuff and actually focus on the spiritual and ask for some extra help there
6146112 about dogmatism and the kind of zealotry that motivates the faithful to blow themselves up shoot abortion doctors and persecute homosexuals but i also worry about narrow exclusiveness that champions the scientific way of knowing to the exclusion of all else i dont like to see science turned into a club to bash religious believers
6146113 vital that we restore the role of objective science in policymaking
6146114 on the one hand we got a brilliant and heartfelt guide to how darwins ideas developed on the other virtually every point was accompanied by a vigorous yet entirely predictable sideswipe at religious believers and their benighted ways
6146115 this only had the effect of constantly interrupting the interesting stuff it was also like watching someone with a sort of anti religious version of tourettes syndrome and certainly confirmed that the downside of having an obsession is that you become a bit of a bore
6146116 dawkins did well in his role as writer and presenter to remain as placid as he did given his well known impatience with humans who still believe in such superstitious nonsense as god
6146117 was that dawkins is not only a rationalist but is also a literalist even deeply religious christians are happy to consider the bible to be metaphorical rather than narrative but he cannot do so he sticks rigidly to the idea that since the bible describes the world beginning 6 000 years ago when really life began four million years ago god cant exist
6146118 there is something almost biblical in the desire of this high profile hard rationalist to smite the unbelievers and remove them from the face of the earth using the implacable power of science and reason
6146119 sight of him looking awestruck as he gazed at a first edition of was especially stirring when he showed us some of darwins own pigeon specimens from the 1850s he duly handled them like holy relics
6146120 the truth is that blind faith in the ability of technology to sustain a growing global population hard wired to materialism that has already breached environmental limits is bonkers
6146121 faith group leaders must be more vociferous in challenging this they have unique access to governments and institutions they must exercise that influence by holding them to account

6146135 british rule instilled in us a sense of inferiority complex even till lately the type of craze we had for foreign goods only after 1990s when the licence permit quota raj ended and the private companies were able to compete freely did the thinking change and it had an effect on the public sector companies also as they became better
6146136 it is true that the idea of brands was conceptualised recently the order prevalent earlier was different we used to criticise the private sector the responsibility for development was taken over completely by the government there was a lack of confidence towards the private sector
6146137 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6146138 some of these allegations have trickled into the the huffington post of internal company documents public records and interviews with key players buttresses the plaintiffs charges and provides a more detailed and shocking picture of buchanans apparently extensive wrongdoing
6146139 vern buchanan the republican fundraiser who took over katherine harriss seat in southern florida is the fourth richest man in congress with assets including some fifteen auto dealerships in florida and elsewhere properties in several states and offshore companies his net worth is estimated to be well over 100 million
6146140 hillary clinton is coming to palm beach county on thursday in an attempt to mend infighting between her fans and those of barack obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominee
6146141 mccain used the arrival of tropical storm fay to demonstrate that he still doesnt support or even understand one of the most important campaign issues for florida that would be national disaster insurance which the house has passed in the form of legislation sponsored by reps ron klein d boca raton and tim mahoney d palm beach gardens before the january presidential primary sen mccain wrongly stated that the klein mahoney bill would cost taxpayers 200 billion he also stated wrongly that a better option for repaying big insurance claims would be the federal emergency management agency whose mission does not include insurance claims
6146142 floridas economy has declined more quickly and deeply than the economists have anticipated that history though doesnt faze crist
6146143 if there were no question that lowering the legal drinking age from 21 to 18 would significantly reduce the incidence of binge drinking and encourage more responsible alcohol consumption we would wholeheartedly endorse the idea
6146144 with less than a week before the primary election two democrats vying for congress are flooding the airwaves to reach central florida voters alan grayson and charlie stuart two of the five candidates seeking the democratic nomination for the u s house seat now held by republican rep ric keller each have tv spots scheduled to run in heavy rotation right up until the polls close tuesday

6146146 its back to the polls today for early voting the state required program costing broward taxpayers about 200 000 for the aug 26 primary early voting was canceled monday and tuesday as officials battened down the hatches to prepare for tropical storm fay its not as if many people were inconvenienced total voters during the first seven days of early voting through sunday 8 800
6146147 they were respectful and polite applauding at the appropriate times but afterward there was no rush to buy the new guy a drink
6146148 walter sandell a 70 year old veteran from new jersey noted that the groups leaders who shared the stage with obama didnt hide their preference for mccain
6146149 the deadline to request an absentee ballot is 5 p m wednesday the request has to be at the supervisor of elections office by phone mail or in person by 5 p m that day
6146150 while it can be done at the polls its inconvenient for voters said mary cooney director of public services at the broward supervisor of elections office

6146154 judicial races are more subdued and stingier this election than in the past with fewer candidates raising less money there are only nine contested races compared to 16 in 2006 and only one three way contest meaning there are 19 candidates versus the 35 who ran two years ago

6146158 a lot of democrats are still holding out hope for a clinton obama ticket
6146159 he can win florida with hillary clinton on the ticket and i dont think he can win it without her said miami lawyer ira leesfield a top clinton money raiser
6146160 with hillary clinton he gets a bump in the hispanic community and a bump in the jewish community and a huge bump among women

6146163 we have seen significant improvements in wound healing for patients with either venous stasis ulcers or diabetic wounds using mist therapy
6146164 this advanced wound care treatment destroys and removes bacteria and stimulates the regeneration of healthy tissue all without contact to the wound as a result patients have less pain and better outcomes in a shorter time
6146165 celleration is an exciting example of how clarians clinical expertise and investment capital can be combined to advance the adoption of a new medical technology
6146166 we were attracted to the investor syndicate quality of the management team and the opportunity to contribute to the continued expansion of a technology that can significantly improve patient care

6146171 nach der em ist klar dass eine neue periode beginnt jeder wei von ballack und frings was sie k nnen aber jeder kann sich einen vorteil erarbeiten bis 2010 ist ein langer weg da z hlt das leistungsprinzip das betrifft einfach alle
6146172 neue spieler heranzuf hren und zu integrieren es dr ngen viele junge spieler nach
6146173 ich wei dass michael ballack und torsten frings hervorragende spieler sind die es gilt zu verdr ngen ich k mpfe um meinen platz und hoffe dass der zeitpunkt kommt dass ich sie abl sen kann
6146174 wir wollen in der qualifikation m glichst schon am anfang viele punkte holen russland ist ein starker gegner in der gruppe wir wollen den stress der relegation m glichst vermeiden
6146175 wir wollen aufs tempo dr cken solange es von der kraft her geht wir wollen dominant auftreten mit schwung in die neue saison starten und das spiel gewinnen
6146176 dass es in dieser fr hen phase der saison schwierig ist viele aufschl sse zu gewinnen es wird aber dennoch zu sehen sein wo der ein oder andere steht
6146177 er wird auf jeden fall spielen ob von anfang an oder in der zweiten halbzeit wei ich noch nicht
6146178 seine nominierung war folgerichtig und erfolgte nicht weil auch die t rkei interesse hat
6146179 inflation is not only because of the domestic factors but the global factors have also contributed significantly
6146180 the need to reduce deficit was initially for reducing the crowding out effect but now it is needed to control inflation also
6146181 the option of increasing revenue through indirect taxes is virtually impossible
6146182 the alternate revenue mobilisation option can only come through direct taxes
6146183 the total direct tax collection during april july 2008 is rs 71 648 crore rs 716 48 billion as against an amount of rs 48 756 crore rs 487 56 billion during the last corresponding period growth of 46 95 percent
6146184 the trend of direct tax collections is one of the many indicators of the health of the economy the robust growth of direct tax collections by 47 percent in april july 2008 is rather an indication of a buoyant economy
6146185 they set the sentences for july 30 because theyre trying to avoid the appearance that this has to do with the protest permit but thats all that this is about
6146186 the resolution of these protests were through dialogue and communication
6146187 this is the way we like to deal with things in chinese culture chinese culture always emphasizes harmony
6146188 these new protest parks are really old wine in new bottles
6146189 you get two results you either dont get permission or youre intimidated into withdrawing your application
6146190 iol automated reports provides key metrics that successful dealers need to monitor on a daily basis with more than 13 000 dealer inventories in our system we feel it is our duty to make this vital data more accessible and to provide to dealers free of charge
6146191 over 80 of all vehicle sales originate from the web and it is now more important than ever to provide consumers with accurate and up to date inventory information 24 7 the reports make it easy for dealer management to stay in the loop and receive an honest assessment of the state of their online inventory ultimately the goal is to hold the entire dealership team accountable towards making sure that effective internet marketing best practices are implemented and consistently followed every day
6146192 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6146193 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6146194 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6146195 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6146196 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6146197 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6146198 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6146199 haben allerdings sehr exzentrische bahnen und k nnen sich bis zu 1000 astronomische einheiten von der sonne entfernen
6146200 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6146201 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6146202 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6146203 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6146204 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6146205 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6146206 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6146207 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
6146208 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6146209 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6146210 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6146211 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6146212 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6146213 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6146214 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
6146215 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
6146216 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6146217 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6146218 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6146219 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6146220 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6146221 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6146222 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6146223 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6146224 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6146225 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that
6146226 search engines today primarily match words in a search to words on a web page we can solve these problems by working to understand the intent behind each search and the concepts and meaning embedded in a web page doing so we can innovate in the quality of the search results in the flexibility with which searchers can phrase their queries and in the search user experience

6146244 what interested me most was to explore the relationship between the ghetto and the city
6146245 this was a city that was undergoing radical demographic shift under the nazis who were colonizing poland and lodz was to be a showcase of this colonization effort
6146246 this is a rather large microcosm of what the germans were doing in eastern europe during the occupation
6146247 the nazis were not sure what they were going to do with the jewish population but the first step was seizing their assets and enclosing them in a guarded situation
6146248 it was always in the air but the nazi had to go through a period of consideration of what was possible they had to figure out themselves what they were going to do
6146249 new documentation new visual evidence from that time period opened up possibilities
6146250 i looked beyond the war news on page one and into the local sections which dealt with events and the remodeling efforts to make the city a gleaming cultural jewel
6146251 my hunch was right their prospective vision all be it filtered through the nazi lens reveals a great deal about the mentality of the new city fathers and the nazi design
6146252 you find not unexpectedly that they cannot help but make reference to the ghetto to all that the jews had supposedly done to harm the city
6146253 we must examine a civilizational problem that arises when looking at the nazis
6146254 in some ways i think we are still puzzling over the problematic relationship between the idea that life goes on while simultaneously life is in danger or more than in danger being destroyed
6146255 they were able to continue with their work which was of course the work of annihilation while at the same time enjoying the fruits of culture and civilization im curious about this
6146256 did he do what he thought was best to keep jews in the lodz ghetto alive
6146257 it can be draining at times but i think its important work to do perhaps you can call it a calling or a mission and that sustains me i believe in what all historians do in part we are mediating the memory of another generation
6146258 day 1 was spent at iris slab in the inyo national forest not the easiest area to access with a wobbly log across a wide stream testing our balance and coordination skills early on
6146259 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market
6146260 we have a very small portion of the biomass that goes to the seeds and all the other stuff basically dries up and nothing much happens with it
6146261 we could use that vegetative tissue all that biomass that is going into making a plant
6146262 lipid trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plastid in arabidopsis requires the extraplastidic tgd4 protein
6146263 we believe especially with the pc that community is a huge part of what were doing online in dragon age origins and the dragon age universe as a whole
6146264 weve a lot of plans to not only bring the users into the community through the tool set but also through a lot of initiatives were taking within online activity downloadable content both pre release and post release free content paid for content online achievements

6146268 we wanted to draw attention not to a prevalent threat but to a possible future one
6146269 youre asking hundreds of thousands or millions of people to wear something every day for a theoretical risk

6146276 sometimes they act as if theyre invisible even though theyre not
6146277 its about what people become when they get into their cars
6146278 i think many people in michigan and kansas and across the country really dont know much about john mccains policies and how he has voted the last 25 years
6146279 instead of building two new coal plants which would produce 11 million new tons of carbon dioxide each year
6146280 we now know that carbon has a huge impact on the atmosphere and global warming is very real in a state like kansas where over 20 percent of our jobs and economy involves agriculture and the land changes in the climate and atmosphere can be devastating kansas has great opportunities in clean energy and alternative fuels
6146281 new transmission lines were to be part of the 3 6 billion sunflower electric power corp project
6146282 but with the fate of that project in doubt several western kansas officials say their projects arent feasible without the additional transmission capacity
6146283 id say this decision pretty much halts wind development in western kansas
6146284 we need transmission lines and we need the coal plants to get them
6146285 not only do we lose the 3 6 billion expansion investment and those hundreds of jobs wont happen
6146286 but other companies considering expansion in kansas may see us as an unfriendly place to do business and tens of thousands of kansans now face the very real possibility of higher electric bills
6146287 honey this guy hasnt seen a woman in years just cooperate with anything he wants if he wants sex with you just go along with it and pretend you like it our lives depend on it

6146293 i am convinced there is no value or need for your type of character in this community you have shown complete disdain for community standards
6146294 therefore on behalf of the law abiding citizens of this community i have no choice than to request that you
6146295 no im a councillor who cares for his community and wants to make it a little safer and is doing everything i can within the legal realm to do that i dont want to step out of my bounds to do it and im not suggesting that i break any laws in doing it but its time for me and perhaps some others to do the same thing
6146296 i strive to find and create divergent themes rather than repeating the same motif in each canvas
6146297 i feel compelled to explore a range of emotional stages and struggles people with character or dignity capture me people who inherently project strong emotions unexpected emotions
6146298 their true personalities emerge i rarely ask subjects to stay still i want them to move talk and relax this lets me infuse my work with a sense of movement more accurately revealing the whole person
6146299 if youre going to paint landscape you have to go beyond the obvious i was looking for something unexpected something surprising landscape is all about the use of space

6146312 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
6146313 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

6146315 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
6146316 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
6146317 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
6146318 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
6146319 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
6146320 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems

6146322 times are tough and what a lot of everyday people fail to recognize is that they can make money from home without a lot of experience albeit with a helping hand
6146323 the daily writing jobs report really opens up opportunities for individuals who are new to the writing field showing them not only what they need in order to get started as a freelance writer but how to find the writing jobs that fit their talents schedules and writing abilities in addition to that any writer or would be writer who so chooses has the option to receive personal support from a writer who has been in their shoes
6146324 truthfully writing for the web isnt for everybody but the demand for freelance writing services are at an all time high if somebody wants to make money while working from home whether its part time or full time becoming a freelance writer is certainly a viable option

6146344 in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6146345 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6146346 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6146347 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6146348 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6146349 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
6146350 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws

6146355 we were not surprised by musharrafs resignation and we now expect a more hostile leadership
6146356 since then musharraf has had little time for anything other than survival
6146357 very little took place on the level of bilateral relations with israel
6146358 jordans policy is not based on the game of axes
6146359 the hamas jordan talks represent a positive step that opens a new chapter in ties between the two sides that could pave the ground for new alliances to boost the interests of both the jordanian and palestinian people
6146360 this dialogue is in the interest of jordan and palestine
6146361 it was the kind of test that iran conducted earlier this year and meant to show that syria could fire missiles simultaneously from a range of batteries in the southern and central parts of the country
6146362 we asked israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state but they said theyre a sovereign state
6146363 well israel shouldnt be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to israels neighbors
6146364 whether this will be a serious offer or something just to scare the israelis well know in another few months
6146365 we told the israelis that this was a very unwise move and that russians were being killed because of georgias policy
6146366 they didnt take us seriously probably because they were encouraged by the united states
6146367 in 2007 israeli experts trained georgian commandos in georgia and there were plans to supply heavy weaponry electronic weapons tanks and other arms at a later date
6146368 the significant military aid provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future probably in the near future relations between russia and israel as well as russias attitude toward arab states
6146369 russia will reassess its relations with israel and it is likely that moscow will decide to increase its military aid to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria
6146370 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
6146371 so hizbullah is violating 1701 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south also we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
6146372 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizbullah or to kick hizbullah out south of the litani
6146373 i know they are careful not to challenge unifil and there is practically no visible hizbullah fighter to be seen
6146374 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
6146375 the media in the u s reflects the interests of the u s government of the u s imperialists
6146376 gloria featured on russia today television regarding russia georgia war
6146377 say no to war has been justin raimondos slogan for over a decade rom the u s intervention in bosnia to the war in iraq and afghanistan now he has denounced u s support for georgia
6146378 nearly 90 million pay tv viewers in europe north america and south africa regularly watch russia today
6146379 as well as on cable networks in practically every country of europe
6146380 the station is part of the state owned news conglomerate ria novosti and news organizations routinely refer to it as state run including the new york times which has said it was created to promote pro kremlin views
6146381 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict i think it is very important for the united states to work with the un security council and others in the international community to make sure that we are beginning to bring this conflict to a close
6146382 some major newspapers are beginning to tone down their initial anti russian stance

6146398 youre such a jerk thanks for getting my hopes all up for nothing so whats supposed to happen now is the end inevitable with or without his coming
6146399 it always has been within the human tendency to destroy himself eventually
6146400 that the lion is dicking around doing nothing instead of heading towards his show hes only been a metaphor to present the people to where theyve ended up the only difference will be now they dont get a dramatic introduction to their own self destruction
6146401 then why the fuck would you wake me up to have to try to pretend to enjoy more of your stupid senselessness

6146415 well first of all this was all a fuck up in making man i was a bit sloppy and lazy here and there amp they developed an inclination towards their own destruction within their genetic code i didnt write this code it kind of evolved on its own accord i mean i tried to give them the gift of mortality but they didnt like it and are killing everything around them as a result you are more their creation than my own
6146416 how can you be disappointed in me if im not even your creation or employee
6146417 because you thought you were and you took the chance to defy whatever created you to do your own thing and then just settled for this lameness as your rebellion
6146418 is this really all youre going to do to end your monotony what about my monotony what about everyones monotony
6146419 look if im not going to bring man his end why should i bring you your entertainment fuck you all seriously

6146422 i i i mean youre right but im scared to get involved anymore i promised i wouldnt because i kept making things worse
6146423 well maybe you should learn to be more accountable for your actions and inactions stop being such a pussy and put some real effort into making things right for a change
6146424 no it really is i wish i knew where to begin
6146425 i think you already have ive already fucked everything up i guess i shouldnt be so afraid of interfering as much as possible to make things better even if it ends up worse
6146426 yes youve inspired me to just fucking try and see what happens
6146427 yes and i think if you dont want to entertain me and if youre too afraid to do anything worthwile ill have to take matters into my own hands

6146435 the whole calculation of how much carbon you can absorb in the ocean is linked to this question of how microbes near the oceans surface respond to carbon and nutrient ratios
6146436 this predicts that youd actually have a carbon release under some conditions
6146437 instead of burying more carbon youll bury less than if you didnt have the increased carbon inputs
6146438 this is a very important piece of evidence if we try to understand what will happen in the future
6146439 in the midst of these experiences that are both painful and delightful together our lord sometimes gives the soul feelings of jubilation and a strange prayer it doesnt understand what im saying seems like gibberish but certainly the experience takes place in this way

6146471 yo que soy su mejor amigo declaro ante dios y la historia que lorca poeta ciento por ciento era consustancialmente el ser m s apol tico que jam s he conocido fue sencillamente una v ctima propiciatoria de problemas personales personal simos ultralocales y ante todo presa inocente de la confusi n omnipotente convulsiva y c smica de la guerra civil espa ola una cosa es cierta cada vez que en el fondo de mi soledad logro hacer brillar una idea genial sac ndola desde lo m s rec ndito de mi cerebro a la superficie del aire de cadaqu s o cuando logro dar una pincelada milagrosa siempre escucho la voz ronca y dulcemente af nica de lorca que me grita ol
6146472 de todos los seres vivos que he conocido federico es para m el mejor y no hablo de sus obras teatrales o de sus poemas estoy hablando de l l era la obra maestra me resulta dif cil imaginar a alguien que le pudiese igualar cuando se sentaba al piano para imitar a chopin al improvisar una pantomima o una escena corta de teatro siempre resultaba irresistible no importa lo que leyese en voz alta siempre surg a belleza de sus labios pose a pasi n ganas de vivir juventud era como una llama
6146473 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
6146474 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
6146475 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
6146476 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
6146477 we advocated that rather than more information on the sidewall better the information be required at the point of sale
6146478 right now that tire efficiency data is not widely available
6146479 cost effective for consumers and the nation to reduce oil use
6146480 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
6146481 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
6146482 hey i boarded ill be there in about an hour and a half to two hours
6146483 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
6146484 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
6146485 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
6146486 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
6146487 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
6146488 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words
6146489 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6146490 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
6146491 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6146492 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6146493 what made me so angry hes 3 years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school
6146494 en pol tica nada ocurre por casualidad cada vez que un acontecimiento surge se puede estar seguro que fue previsto para llevarse a cabo de esa manera

6146533 i dont know if he would recognize the republican party today
6146534 im sure if we were to raise his ashes from the colorado river
6146535 because he looked at mccain and said here was this young guy who has a lot of potential in the republican party who is coming through the ranks and then he pulled something like this
6146536 i admired him to the point of reverence and i wanted him to like me he was usually cordial just never as affectionate as i would have liked
6146537 i think at the end of my grandfathers career first of all he would be looking at what state we are in today with what bush has done and i think he would be just incredibly appalled
6146538 i think his head would be spinning how in the world did we get ourselves in this state how did this happen what went wrong where did this republican party go
6146539 i dont think my grandfather would ever pander to the religious right like mccain did that would get him angrier than anything he believed in the division between church and state he fought that constantly and these guys are getting in there religion is a wonderful thing but it does not have any place or purpose in politics
6146540 my grandfather was for womens rights the idea that my body is mine and what i want to do with it i will do with it mccain isnt of that mindset
6146541 hillary you know was a goldwater girl and she has this great tenacity
6146542 unfortunately she has been directed in some ways that havent really worked for her campaign i really like what obama is representing i like the fact that if he becomes our next president the walls will come down people around the world will view the u s as a more enlightened open minded country it will be overall an extremely positive mood
6146543 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6146544 im shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6146545 i dont think his training has given him enough speed endurance but eventually it will have and then i will be able to kiss my record goodbye
6146546 there was stage fright right there mate definitely stage fright
6146547 in the end you just have to see them as ordinary players you try to come out and put your best foot forward and see what happens
6146548 we felt that in this game that they were going to live and die by the 3 pointer
6146549 they made a couple we had a couple of defensive breakdowns but we took care of it thats the beauty of this team on the fly we can solve problems without having to call timeouts communication is a big weapon for us nobody is afraid to talk to one another because we all respect one another
6146550 with our team it always comes down to timely hits
6146551 we were often in scoring position but we forgot that we dont need to swing big because yukiko ueno provides the power
6146552 it was a nail biter that could have gone either way
6146553 this is probably the first beach volleyball match ive been nervous in before the match actually started
6146554 probably because if we lost i would have been devastated

6146558 i missed out on sydney 2000 because i was very young and in athens 2004 because of injury now im 28 years old and more mature
6146559 weve fought many matches against each other in pan american events and weve known each other for a long time we know each other strengths and weaknesses i thought i went the extra mile and put in the extra effort and when the judge approached us it crossed my mind that he would be inclined to raise the hand in my favor and it would be a great joy for my country
6146560 with the skills ive got i should beat him everyday
6146561 this time im going to use my brain and he shouldnt beat me
6146562 no one serves up a gold medal on a silver platter
6146563 i am responsible for making a breakthrough in sailing for the chinese
6146564 at the beginning of the regatta things werent going very well for me but i was mentally prepared for such events and i would not give up until the very end
6146565 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6146566 we have played them twice world league 2008 and world championships 2007 and we have beaten them twice
6146567 i expect the same we did not play our best here one goal can decide the game
6146568 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later

6146588 scheffer ist weder balte noch pole geh rt also nicht zu den nationen die von moskau einer irrationalen russophobie bezichtigt werden scheffer hat einfach den worten ihr gewicht wieder gegeben er erinnerte daran dass drohungen einer raketenattacke ausgesprochen von einem ranghohen offizier eines staates der zu den wichtigsten demokratischen l ndern geh ren m chte nicht normal sind sowohl jaap de hoop scheffer als auch us au enministerin rice haben die beunruhigenden tendenzen beim namen genannt das ist gut so denn gerade die devaluierung der worte in der diplomatie hat den kreml ermuntert von seiner arroganten rhetorik zur politik der panzer berzugehen nur dass harte worte immer noch keine konsequenzen in der situation in georgien haben die russischen panzer fahren immer noch ber georgischen boden wenn der westen kein wirksames druckmittel findet um die russen zum r ckzug zu zwingen wird sein ansehen stark leiden denn worte allein auch die st rksten reichen hier nicht
6146589 vor dem gestrigen sondertreffen war viel von einem wendepunkt die rede gewesen und davon dass man die beziehungen zu russland grunds tzlich berdenken m sse alles was dann in br ssel herauskam war die ank ndigung dass die beratungen mit moskau im gemeinsamen nato russland rat bis zum abzug der russischen truppen ausgesetzt w rden normalerweise ist man solch schwammige windelweiche reaktionen vom eu au enpolitik beauftragten solana gewohnt aber inzwischen scheint auch die nato schon weitgehend solanisiert die russen selbst haben schon vor der georgien krise wiederholt klargemacht was sie vom nato russland rat halten n mlich so gut wie nichts eine quasselbude seis halt in der man ein bisschen ins denken und tun der westlichen allianz reinhorchen kann ohne sich selbst zu allzu viel verpflichten zu m ssen aber wie weit ist es eigentlich noch von der solanisierung zur schr derisierung der nato der deutsche ex kanzler schr der des kremls treuester propagandist im westen hat dem deutschen nachrichtenmagazin spiegel gerade erkl rt dass von russland nicht die geringste gefahr ausgehe und das land im westen einfach nur falsch wahrgenommen werde ja ja das ist europas lichte zukunft la schr der wir werden alle gazprom angestellte h ren radio moskau und plappern brav jede kreml parole nach
6146590 die nato hat es nicht einfach es gibt keine einigkeit dar ber wie man handeln soll russland muss eine reaktion zu sp ren bekommen und diese reaktion muss scharf sein sagt das eine lager nicht sehr klug sagen die anderen und weisen auf die konomischen verbindungen hin die debatte gleicht mehr dem sicherheitsrat der vereinten nationen als einem milit rischen b ndnis entwickelt sich die nato zu noch einem internationalen diskussionsklub es sieht danach aus wenn eine organisation wie die osze als beschlussf hig und relevant in einem politischen konflikt erscheint ist es definitiv an der zeit die nato mit neuen augen zu sehen nicht mehr als verteidigungsversicherungsorganisation aber vielleicht als organisation die personal und material f r missionen au erhalb der eigenen grenzen zur verf gung stellt f r uns schweden sollte das der ideale klub sein denn die gegenseitigen zusicherungen nach dem motto der musketiere einer f r alle alle f r einen haben uns bisher abgeschreckt
6146591 wie w rde russland heute reagieren wenn estland und die anderen baltischen staaten jetzt der nato beitreten wollten seien wir froh dass dies bereits passiert ist aber das beantwortet noch nicht die noch wichtigere frage ob man uns zur hilfe kommen w rde die klausel dass im verteidigungsfall alle mitgliedsl nder f reinander einstehen m ssen ist noch nicht auf die probe gestellt worden aber u erungen aus den usa zufolge ist s dossetien mit seinen 70 000 einwohnern kein grund f r einen dritten weltkrieg dann m sste man freilich fragen ab wann ein land gro genug f r eine intervention ist
6146592 polen ist einfach nur der neueste strohmann f r eine us amerikanische au enpolitik die von lobbyisten der milit rindustrie in washington diktiert wird die amerikanische regierung versichert dass die abfangraketen die an der baltischen k ste stationiert werden nichts mit russland zu tun haben ihr zweck ist es europa und die usa gegen die interkontinentalraketen zu verteidigen die der iran und nordkorea nicht besitzen das ist der grund warum sie in polen aufgestellt werden das wie jeder texanische geografiestudent wei an beide schurkenstaaten grenzt das system ist seit 1946 in der entwicklung und hat bis jetzt unterm strich nichts erreicht die us amerikanische politik ist wegen des versagens der republikaner und demokraten die probleme der kampagnenfinanzierung anzugehen im kern verfault die bundesregierung ist ein riesiges wohlfahrtsprogramm f r unternehmen das jene industriezweige die millionen dollar an politischen spenden vergeben mit vertr gen belohnt die milliarden wert sind die raketenabwehr ist der gr te fleischtopf von allen die interessen der regierung waren immer provinziell die usa haben keine wirkliche au enpolitik sie haben eine reihe von innenpolitischen strategien die sie ber ihre grenzen projiziert die einzig interessante frage ist wer bezahlt wird und wie hoch die politischen schmiergelder ausfallen

6146606 in erinnerung an den mutigen kampf der tschechen und slowaken um freiheit tag f r tag an diesem neuen europa zu arbeiten ist gemeinsamer auftrag des 21 august 1968 gerade heute wo f r uns allzu viel selbstverst ndlich geworden ist m ssen wir bewusst machen dass noch vor 40 jahren freiheit gerechtigkeit demokratie und eine offene gesellschaft in unserer unmittelbaren nachbarschaft und f r die h lfte unseres kontinents erst eine ferne hoffnung war
6146607 der prager fr hling war eine der gro en wegmarken hin zur welthistorischen wende nach berlin 1953 und ungarn 1956 sind der prager fr hling die schlussakte von helsinki und die charta 77 die geistigen grundlagen f r die wiedervereinigung unseres kontinents
6146608 1968 hat die kraftquellen des zukunftsgerichteten europ ischen selbstverst ndnisses bewusst gemacht den hunger nach freiheit menschenrechten demokratie und rechtstaatlichkeit letztlich hat die kraft des europ ischen lebensmodells das kommunistische unterdr ckungssystem berwunden das macht mut auch heute im geeinten europa denn was das neue europa mit all seiner vielfalt im innersten zusammenh lt ist genau diese gemeinsame vorstellung davon wie wir europ er leben wollen
6146609 der prager fr hling und sein furchtbares ende hat f r uns eine starke und bleibende nachbarschaftliche komponente
6146610 das jahr 1968 ist teil unserer gemeinsamen geschichte und unserer spezifischen nachbarschaftlichen erfahrung die spontane hilfsbereitschaft und solidarit t der sterreicherinnen und sterreicher f r unsere tschechischen und slowakischen freunde ist bis heute in beiden l ndern unvergessen
6146611 40 jahre nach der niederschlagung des prager fr hlings meinen manche dass sich die geschichte wiederholt ich kann ihnen dazu meine sicht der dinge sagen die geschichte wiederholt sich nicht die zeit der ideologischen trennung der welt in einen kommunistischen und einen westlichen block ist endg ltig berwunden
6146612 vor dem hintergrund von 1968 verstehen wir vielleicht besser als andere die beklemmung unserer nachbarn angesichts der aktuellen ereignisse in georgien
6146613 die dramatischen entwicklungen haben uns die bittere einsicht beschert dass es auch in der welt des jahres 2008 m glich ist dass ein land das mitglied des europarates ist die souver nit t und territoriale integrit t eines anderen mitgliedslandes des europarates in frage stellt und teile dessen staatsgebietes mit waffengewalt besetzt gerade auch bei einem anlass wie dem heutigen muss gesagt sein dass europa im angesicht eines derartigen vorgehens nicht einfach zur tagesordnung bergehen kann panzer k nnen nicht das wesentliche merkmal der au enpolitik einer zukunftsmacht sein die sprache der bedrohung kann nicht die sprache der zukunft sein
6146614 gerade wir sterreicher bewundern und sch tzen russlands reiches geistiges schaffen seine kultur und seine menschen die russische seele und die russische gr e aber eines ist ebenso klar wir wollen nie wieder angst haben m ssen vor russland die grundlage einer guten partnerschaft ist der kostbare rohstoff vertrauen

6146686 although prices have fallen to a whole new level of affordability the real estate market is gaining substantial strength here in petaluma and southern sonoma county

6146690 our local economy is in better shape than most others in the bay area and we have good reason to firmly believe that our real estate market offers the best deal to buyers in this region
6146691 depreciation although not good for the seller has opened multiple doors for the first time buyer and investor

6146753 i thought it would be nice to do something that i had never done before
6146754 i grew up with dogs and know that they are really a part of the family
6146755 we started our business to produce quality draft horse riding products which were not available at the time
6146756 i had been thinking about starting my own business for quite some time
6146757 the temptation about knowing a secret is to use it in a conversation its like wealth or fame when i say i know a secret im in the in crowd people seem to want to know me people pay attention to me invite me to things give me gifts it feels like they want me but what they want is for me to tell the secret they want the power they will get from knowing what i know
6146758 we get tempted to reveal the secret as a reward for the attention we get or as an intimacy building disclosure but secrets are like a one night stand well be forgotten or resented if we tell that can lead to some things we dont want
6146759 i didnt know how much i was asking of an assistant as a therapist i was in the secrets keeping biz i was hoping and continue to hope that being a p i is the secrets freeing biz but you and i are going to know some secrets that people want kept whether we think its best or not and i know were going to get hit up to tell probably aggressively
6146760 will have a working relationship relationships are based on trust trust is based on experience experience takes time this case gives us no time our clients are in great distress we have to start now before we go any farther i have to know that you understand how crucial trust is to our work together how crucial confidentiality keeping secrets is i have to be able to trust you and i barely know you
6146761 if we go with your thesis that trust takes time then nothing i could say would help you trust me
6146762 it wont be what i say but what i do that earns your trust and theres no time for you to experience my do is that it
6146763 it depends on what you mean by trust to be as authentic and direct as i can be with you yes to do my best to do what i say im going to do yes to keep what you tell me confidential yes to be perfect no you can know that my goal is to be conscious of what im doing to choose what i do according to my principles and values and to apologize when i dont im human though my choices and actions are limited to what i can see and understand at the time i will hurt you i will let you down its part of human relationships that said i try to be conscious not unconscious rational not irrational
6146764 to not let go of trying to do right by people
6146765 most guys just say oh yes baby you can trust me
6146766 you know my father so probably you know my whole life story youve probably been a p i on my case and know all my vital statistics
6146767 im really sorry that was inappropriate for a work environment if you felt offended i am very sorry
6146768 so this is already an unequal relationship through being a private investigator you have knowledge of me that i dont have of you its a power advantage i didnt realize how much i resented that until i made my sassy comment good to know
6146769 as a private investigator then when you find the secrets you have the power then you give it to the clients and they have the power
6146770 how about if i walk across the street and get us some coffees what would you like then we can start on the case

6146868 the ecuadorian people do not want foreign troops on our soil and the government has to follow the mandate of its people
6146869 we have spent more than 150 million on troops to monitor the border with colombia and will continue to support anti narcotics operations in our country
6146870 the operations there are critical to our overall counternarcotics strategy but ecuador has promised continued close cooperation to confront the threat of drug smuggling
6146871 we note however that the closure will leave a serious gap in efforts by the united states and our partners to confront illegal drug trafficking throughout the region

6146875 weve bootstrapped the company placing our emphasis on creating a great place to work and on providing great value to our clients rapid growth wasnt our objective online advertising has boomed and weve grown along with the channel i am tremendously proud of what our team has accomplished
6146876 to me the greatest joy has been in the manner of growth not the amount of growth
6146877 weve grown on revenues not vc funding not loans not acquisitions but rather from providing great service to a growing pool of clients moreover were doing it in a way that generates quality jobs and career options in my home town without grinding our employees into the ground people work hard here but its 40 hours a week not 60 thats important to us

6146890 theres a moral problem with all the pro georgia cheerleading which has gotten lost in the op ed blasts against putins neo imperialism a recurring phenomenon of the early cold war was that america encouraged oppressed peoples to rise up and fight for freedom and then when things got rough abandoned them to their fate the cia did that egregiously in the early 1950s broadcasting to the soviet republics and the nations of eastern europe that america would back their liberation from soviet tyranny after the brutal suppression of the hungarian revolution in 1956 responsible u s leaders learned to be more cautious and more honest about the limits of american power now after the georgia war mccain should learn that lesson american leaders shouldnt make threats the country cant deliver or promises it isnt prepared to keep the rhetoric of confrontation may make us feel good but other people end up getting killed

6146896 i am extremely disappointed that they are going to close all five post offices i am very sceptical that the process was complete and transparent
6146897 i believe it was a done deal from the start and the decision was part of a rubber stamping exercise that had all ready been made this result does not bode well for our efforts to keep the harpenden post office open
6146898 regarding the currently popular theory that mankind is responsible for global warming i am very pleased to deliver good news from the front lines of climate change research our latest research results which i am about to describe could have an enormous impact on policy decisions regarding greenhouse gas emissions we now have new satellite evidence which strongly suggests that the climate system is much less sensitive than is claimed by the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc
6146899 another way of saying this is that the real climate system appears to be dominated by
6146900 the support for my claim of low climate sensitivity net negative feedback for our climate system is two fold first we have a new research article in press in the journal of climate which uses a simple climate model to show that previous estimates of the sensitivity of the climate system from satellite data were biased toward the high side by the neglect of natural cloud variability it turns out that the failure to account for natural chaotic cloud variability generated internal to the climate system will always lead to the illusion of a climate system which appears more sensitive than it really is
6146901 the second line of evidence in support of an insensitive climate system comes from the satellite data themselves
6146902 based upon global oceanic climate variations measured by a variety of nasa and noaa satellites during the period 2000 through 2005 we have found a signature of climate sensitivity so low that it would reduce future global warming projections to below 1 deg c by the year 2100
6146903 one necessary result of low climate sensitivity is that the radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions in the last century is not nearly enough to explain the upward trend of 0
6146904 on this issue it can be shown with a simple climate model that small cloud fluctuations can explain 70 of the warming trend since 1900 as well as the nature of that trend warming until the 1940s no warming until the 1970s and resumed warming since then
6146905 i predict that in the coming years there will be a growing realization among the global warming research community that most of the climate change we have observed is natural and that mankinds role is relatively minor given that virtually no research into possible natural explanations for global warming has been performed it is time for scientific objectivity and integrity to be restored to the field of global warming research
6146906 twenty years ago as a phd scientist i intensely studied the evolution versus intelligent design controversy for about two years
6146907 in the scientific community i am not alone there are many fine books out there on the subject curiously most of the books are written by scientists who lost faith in evolution as adults after they learned how to apply the analytical tools they were taught in college
6146908 you might wonder how scientists who are taught to apply disciplined observation and experimentation and to search for natural explanations for what is observed in nature can come to such a conclusion for those of you who consider themselves open minded i will try to explain
6146909 true evolution in the macro sense has never been observed only inferred
6146910 one finally comes to the conclusion that despite vigorous protests belief in evolution and intelligent design are matters of faith
6146911 intelligent design can be studied and taught without resorting to human creation traditions and beliefs which in the west are usually traceable to the first book of the bible genesis just as someone can recognize and study some machine of unknown purpose built by another company country or alien intelligence one can also examine the natural world and ask the question did this machine arise by semi random natural physical processes or could it have been designed by a higher power indeed i was convinced of the intelligent design arguments based upon the science alone
6146912 it was only 40 or so years ago that we were told the vast majority of scientists agreed there was undeniable evidence the planet was rapidly descending into a dangerous period of global cooling
6146913 the north pole is located in the middle of the arctic ocean amidst waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice
6146914 a person intent on killing themselves put a hose from their one exhaust pipe into their car window they died in 11 minutes daily mankind pumps fumes from over 600 million exhaust pipes into the air we all breathe what do you expect will eventually happen
6146915 as for intelligent design spencer is clearly an imbecillic moron with an irrelevant agenda
6146916 anyone who supports religion loses all credibility as a scientist even if its just a little crowd pleasing bit
6146917 what about the thoroughbred racehorse the show dog aquarium fish and wagyu beef cattle their gene pools have expanded while so many other creatures face extinction from the same pressures we all face to adapt survive and breed or otherwise cease to exist
6146918 not all of the ice is in the ocean the two poles are pretty much made entirely of ice south more than north north has a fair bit of land under the ice
6146919 flimsy huh i remember when gore said in the 2000 presidential debates that the earths average temp was going to go up 11 degrees by 2010
6146920 i can remember only a few centuries ago that the overwhelmng consensus in the scientific community was that the earth is flat
6146921 being concerned about the lack of real scientific endeavour and inquisition in the area doesnt mean one has to hate the environment or not be concerned about future generations
6146922 i would describe roy spencer as interested in id rather than supporting it im intrigued by the number of people commenting here who think you can destroy an argument through ad hominem attacks many of the advocates of global warming panic would be equally vulnerable to this sort of attack
6146923 i am very pleased to deliver good news from the front lines of climate change research
6146924 one necessary result of low climate sensitivity is that the radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions in the last century is not nearly enough to explain the upward trend of 0 7 deg c in the last 100 years this raises the question of whether there are natural processes at work which have caused most of that warming

6146940 having had the opportunity to work as a dp and effects supervisor with so many talented broadcast and motion graphic artists i have a deep appreciation for great design we are now in the wonderful position to widen our scope with design and production for this creative realm

6146942 foreclosure is often a lengthy costly and destructive process avoiding foreclosure not only strengthens local neighborhoods where foreclosures are already driving down property values it makes good business sense
6146943 this tragic accident is but the latest example of the destruction that can result from a lack of effective pressure relief systems and practices
6146944 companies should be vigilant to ensure that pressure relief systems are adequate and are properly maintained and operated to continuously protect equipment from over pressure
6146945 dont ever give up thats the moral of the story
6146946 thats what i want the next generation to understand everything just doesnt come all roses all the time that is the nature of this athletics game

6146951 in financial markets like paris and new york we have the opportunity to expand our local point of presence to serve clients in a cloud context
6146952 in europe we will have multiple locations and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense for me to spend thousands of dollars on multiple technology solutions if the power or infrastructure in a country were in is not good
6146953 i have taken a look at companies in the omaha area and those contracted with ibm if there were a disaster that wiped out part of omaha i want to make sure we would not be recovering at the same center as some of the other customers
6146954 there are degrees of success until you truly have a disaster you try to get policies and procedures in place to make sure you can recover what you need in time

6146980 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
6146981 we believe its essential for all nato countries to stay the course so that we accomplish our objectives of creating a stable environment in afghanistan that is not a threat either to its people or people elsewhere in the world
6146982 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6146983 we should not make precipitous choices because of this drama
6146984 but we must redefine the mission and set precise goals
6146985 if the aims are just are the tactics being used to achieve them correct
6146986 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer

6147001 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6147002 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6147003 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6147004 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6147005 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6147006 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6147007 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6147008 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6147009 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6147010 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6147011 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6147012 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6147013 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6147014 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto

6147021 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6147022 a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
6147023 level of objectivity has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
6147024 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential race

6147031 clearly this creates severe effects on the psychosocial well being of these families
6147032 considering that its more dangerous for a man to work sometimes its women that have to work or children that are sent out to work
6147033 but also this has impacts on the synergies within the family because the men feel like im not taking care of my family im losing my role and there are a variety of reactions from depression to taking it out on the family
6147034 i said im a professor i have an invitation and i have a visa everyone else went ahead regardless of their profession
6147035 if they knew i had a government and an embassy and a country to defend me they wouldnt have treated me like this but there is no one and they know it

6147037 i dont have a percentage im just leaning that way turner told reporters in his first public comments since friedgen made the announcement monday
6147038 my whole life is here right now ive been here for three years and that is what i would like to do
6147039 right now i have a lot of support from my family i have a lot of people telling me i should stay or i should go i want to stay i would never want to leave but given the circumstances i am leaning toward staying right now
6147040 i think chris is happy here i hope he wouldnt transfer friedgen said

6147052 we provide educational and recreational activities to reduce the stress that palestinian children suffer from in addition to providing part time work for people who are unemployed
6147053 the goal is to help these children confront the results of violence
6147054 these activities will help huda to begin to heal but her suffering like that of hundreds of other children like her cannot be erased in two years
6147055 for two years i could not smile or even cry then i met huda and we began to move away from the pain and agony
6147056 i want to shame the jews because they killed my father and my sisters
6147057 there are so many stories of suffering in every house you hear different stories

6147059 we have succeeded in moving her past the shock but she is still depressed
6147060 i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother
6147061 you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new team
6147062 the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
6147063 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
6147064 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out
6147065 the mind set for me at bristol has always been to protect the race car and get toward the end and then you really start to race these guys
6147066 sometimes you sneak up on them and dont press the go pedal until its 200 laps to go
6147067 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step
6147068 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
6147069 its a continued effort to find little things here and there
6147070 i dont think its going to be one little thing that puts us back in the mix its hard work commitment and the belief that we can get it done and get back to the top
6147071 my approach was simple when we won the championship it was consistency
6147072 we had nine finishes in the top 10 in the last 10 races and even though its a shorter quick run in the last 10 races its the same mentality and philosophy for 36 races and that is just go out there and get the best finish you can
6147073 you might want to take a few less risks but thats tough for a 24 year old to digest
6147074 the number one taker of black life is abortion and its time people woke up to that fact the location of this latest planned parenthood facility in yet another minority neighborhood is a part of the continuing fulfillment of the racist eugenicist dream of their founder margaret sanger but it is a travesty of the american dream planned parenthoods agenda discards the principle that we are all created equal which is the basis of liberty for all americans

6147104 we need to work that out we need to have greater participation on the part of our nato allies as i said in my opening remarks today and we need a lot more help

6147135 this is a street course with many corners although we expect quite high speeds to be attained over the course of a lap
6147136 as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend
6147137 we should see quite high temperatures so teams will have to be vigilant with their tyre management
6147138 as we have not raced here previously this should be a learning process for everyone involved and strategy decisions over the race weekend will be interesting
6147139 bridgestones participation in 200 formula 1 races shows the level of commitment we have given to the sport and we are delighted to be working with all of the teams and so many major motor manufacturers in our current position as official tyre supplier

6147303 when it comes to medical emergency preparation it is difficult to anticipate the outcome of a situation that has never occurred decisions must be made quickly
6147304 realopt not only helps policy makers better prepare and more efficiently deploy available resources the program also identifies gaps crucial to effective mitigation planning
6147305 realopt is flexible adaptable easy to use and produces meaningful results to the user
6147306 it allows for complex optimization of pods that cannot be determined by the naked eye
6147307 we learned that some local health departments had good plans in place while others had more work to do
6147308 realopt is the first system that looks at the design of strategic planning and operational response on the ground
6147309 it gives policy makers a tool to assess their capabilities for handling large scale medical emergencies and how they might handle scenarios ranging from local public health emergencies to a situation of national magnitude
6147310 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance before they could use a proper lavatory
6147311 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6147312 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6147313 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6147314 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6147315 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6147316 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6147317 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6147318 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6147319 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6147320 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot

6147322 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6147323 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6147324 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6147325 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6147326 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6147327 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6147328 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6147329 the world is not about batman and robin fighting the joker things are more complicated than that
6147330 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6147331 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6147332 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6147333 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6147334 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6147335 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6147336 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6147337 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6147338 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6147380 im excited illinois was chosen to receive federal funding to continue this lifesaving program
6147381 when a family does not have health insurance to cover screenings and preventative care a woman frequently puts her own health as a lower priority than her familys need for health care this grant has allowed these wisewoman participants to have screenings for these risk factors many for the first time the intervention sessions provided a knowledge base and skills for them to improve their diet physical activity and life habits without this grant these screenings would not have been done the impact on these women and their families has been tremendous

6147504 sonicbids has a nice setup but you cant favorite add message or link to other epks heregomydemo could bridge that gap
6147505 there is such a thing as overexposure and its very easy as a musician to abuse the internet
6147506 although it gives you access to millions of people worldwide it has devalued what made finding new music so special for listeners you have to be discerning and clever or else you may find yourself simply annoying your target audience
6147507 no one had ever seen a case where a client picks up that many cases
6147508 i dont know if i did or didnt but i wasnt in the right state of mind im a very sick person

6147513 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
6147514 the kicker is it does show 3 bars of 3g instead of 1 with 2 0 1 so it looks like they just changed the way the bars look with this update now thats useful
6147515 my new iphone 3g i almost threw it out my car window today it dropped 12 calls within 4 hours in downtown houston that is crazy
6147516 i live in the centre of the uks 2nd largest city and my 3g reception is intermittent between 5 bars and zero therefore the connection keeps getting stuck
6147517 and this is after upgrading to 2 0 2 terrible
6147518 wow an acknowledgement by apple of the 3g defect with some of the iphone 3gs well kind of sort of maybe a little bit if you read between the lines
6147519 i suppose that adding in some modicum of connectivity for the new countries scheduled for iphone release on friday could be construed as improved communication with 3g networks

6147545 we think we will continue to see a domino effect from this project
6147546 with danas continued effort the city can only blossom from there there is an emphasis and a commitment to hire people from within the community and further identify markets where there is a need
6147547 we will be hiring about 10 to 13 people as they will be working in shifts

6147556 it was a response to the initial irony of these grand names belonging to kind of small and obscure cities
6147557 these cities were using those names to find an identity through the past or through an association with the past and thats kind of what i was doing as an artist
6147558 they were really excited that someone gave a shit about their city
6147559 particularly being dark skinned like in florence which is 90 percent caucasian but everyone was really friendly

6147577 overnight in the greater toronto area alone we stopped four motorists for doing more than 50 kilometres over the posted speed limit and in another situation a young woman is fighting for her life in hospital as a result of a crash on highway 404 where the driver was well over the posted speed limit and was racing with a friend in another vehicle
6147578 that crash should never have happened its one more example of the tragedy that results when someone shows complete disregard for the law their own life and that of others on the roads
6147579 some motorists think the provinces highways are their own private race tracks we wont put up with that our job is to protect the citizens of ontario and keep our highways safe this morning i was in the opp plane while it was doing aerial traffic enforcement and saw for myself the actions of some drivers who tailgate weave in and out of traffic and speed excessively we identified 13 speeders all going at least 130 kph and one at 146 kph thats one every four minutes

6147585 contemplative prayer is the movement of becoming acquainted experientially with god beyond the confines of rational dialogue it is deeply embedded in the gospel and in the christian tradition jesus suggestion about how to pray is a formula for contemplative prayer in matthew 6 6 he says if you want to pray if you want to relate more profoundly with god enter your inner room next close the door which is an invitation to turn off the internal dialogue then he says pray to your father in secret that could mean a solitary place but such were rare in jesus time for everybody except the very rich nobody else had private rooms you were lucky to have a roof over your head its metaphorical language inviting us to become at ease and present to the divine indwelling the kingdom of god is within you as well as all around you

6147637 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
6147638 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
6147639 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
6147640 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
6147641 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
6147642 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment

6147660 there were two fabulous designs on offer and the passion and thoughtfulness that had gone into the proposals was awe inspiring it is great to see that the current students at heartsease had been involved in putting forward their views and ideas i am sure the new academy will lift the whole area and provide a wonderful learning and community environment
6147661 we wanted the design to reflect the environment and engineering specialism for the school and we are delighted that the winning design incorporates a sustainable aspect wherever possible it will be exciting to watch the development and we know everyone will look forward to moving into the new buildings on completion of the project
6147662 the new academy will provide a whole range of opportunities for students living in the heartsease area these first class facilities highlight how much these students are valued and should help to raise their aspirations for the future
6147663 the design also allows for a strong focus on vocational education with plans for showcase engineering workshops a professional style catering teaching space and beauty salon facilities it means the vocational studies can work well alongside the academic side

6147681 as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend
6147682 we should see quite high temperatures so teams will have to be vigilant with their tyre management
6147683 as we have not raced here previously this should be a learning process for everyone involved and strategy decisions over the race weekend will be interesting

6147982 i myself am a fan of classical music and i know theres a real fight there that needs to be fought for classical music
6147983 but just as much at least as you can argue classical music is important the music that were going to be playing on this show is really really really important as well and doesnt really have a platform on the radio right now

6147990 not only do they have to stay on top of their own familys activities but many of them are also required to volunteer at their school and help plan events for their kids groups its great that companies like centerd are coming to the rescue and helping busy parents plan and organize complex group events that require a lot of time and volunteer coordination

6148032 students usually sabotage their efforts to read or write by believing that they cant succeed at tasks that require literate behavior their struggles with literacy tasks result from lack of knowledge of and control over the strategic routines needed to engage in meaningful transactions with texts struggling readers and writers rarely take active roles in constructing meaning they often remain passive and disengaged not only do struggling readers and writers lack competence with the use of multiple strategies but they also lack confidence in themselves as literacy learners as a result they are often ambivalent about reading and writing and fail to appreciate what literacy can do for them

6148070 because classrooms are microcosms of society mirroring its strengths and ills alike it follows that the normal socialization patterns of young children that often lead to distorted perceptions of gender roles are reflected in the classrooms yet gender bias in education reaches beyond socialization patterns bias is embedded in textbooks lessons and teacher interactions with students this type of gender bias is part of the hidden curriculum of lessons taught implicitly to students through the every day functioning of their classroom marshall

6148087 state data on students who are excluded from taking the national assessment of educational progress as well as those who are given special help or accommodations during the tests will be featured more prominently in naep reports starting this fallits a national assessment and it should be given as a national assessment

6148098 assumptions of student and teacher identities as heterosexual examples expressed through heterosexual narrative and curricula seeped in gender normativity are all characteristic of the ways in which non normative sexualities are inadvertently excluded from curricular agendas and various social justice reforms

6148106 i was very respected before i came out and that respect didnt change but it was more the parents
6148107 they were worried i was showing students that being gay was okay
6148108 i think its imperative to include a type of glbt studies but id like the message of live and let live be passed on because people get too caught up in labels

6148112 this draft language is still too focused on high stakes testing punishments the labeling of children and unfunded mandates instead it should focus on reducing class sizes promoting teacher training and expanding access to early childhood education

6148121 no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subject to discrimination under any educational programs or activity receiving federal assistance
6148122 rate popularity as being more important than academic competence or independence while boys are expected to follow a boy code that hides their vulnerability
6148123 girls are more likely than boys to take biology and chemistry courses
6148124 over the past three decades boys test cores are going up more boys are going to college and more are getting bachelors degrees
6148125 girls are rewarded for their conformity to classroom rules by simply being ignored thus paying a huge price for their compliance
6148126 four out of five girls experience some form of sexual harassment
6148127 while certain gender differences in cognitive abilities do exist they are not large and the significance of the differences are not clear since men and women are equally intelligent
6148128 treating boys and girls differently in schools including how teachers respond to students what students are encouraged to study and how textbooks and other sources represent gender roles
6148129 the way we should treat boys and girls in society

6148131 whats the point in you going to college youre just going to end up staying at home cooking cleaning and taking care of the kids anyways
6148132 close the achievement gap with accountability flexibility and choice so that no child is left behind
6148133 stronger accountability for results more freedom for states and communities proven education methods and more choices for parents
6148134 requires that each state measure every childs progress in reading and math in each of grades 3 though 8 and at least once during grades 10 through 12 by the school year 2007 2008 states must also have in place science assessments to be administered at least once during grades 3 5 grades 6 9 and grades10 12
6148135 labeled a school in need of improvement it receives extra help to improve and your child has the option to transfer to another public school including a public charter school
6148136 by requiring states to set achievement goals for all groups of students and holding schools and systems accountable for their progress toward meeting those goals nclb prompts educators across the country to challenge long held beliefs and practices and to do what is necessary to ensure that all students achieve at high levels
6148137 yardstick used to measure learning in each state across the country
6148138 across the country forty eight states and the district of columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories the new results show across the board improvement in 4th and 8th grade reading and math with african american and hispanic students posting all time highs in a number of categories
6148139 these results are the latest addition to a growing amount of data that proves no child left behind is working by setting high standards and holding schools accountable for results our students are making more academic progress than ever before
6148140 describes a worthy goal for our nation tragically the reality is that nclb is aggravating not solving the problems that cause many children to be left behind
6148141 boosting standardized test scores should be the primary goal of schools
6148142 this assumption leads to one size fits all teaching that focuses primarily on test preparation and undermines efforts to give all children a high quality education
6148143 because poor teaching is the primary cause of unsatisfactory student performance schools can best be improved by threats and sanctions
6148144 such threats encourage teachers to focus narrowly on boosting test scores
6148145 these punitive actions fail to address underlying problems such as family poverty and inadequate school funding which are major reasons that many students start off behind and never catch up
6148146 nclb relies on an annual test but single tests can be misleading every parent knows children have good and bad days every teacher knows particular classes can be talented or difficult entire classes can be attentive or distracted so accurate measurement requires multiple retesting
6148147 one of my greatest concerns is that the accountability provisions have narrowly defined how student progress is going to be measured and assessment of outcomes is based largely on testing programs that have historically been shown to have limited validity or reliability for diverse populations and for students with disabilities teachers are required to provide effective instruction but without curricula that have been shown to be effective for diverse learners and without assessments that reflect the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of these students
6148148 there are not adequate fiscal human and social resources to create fifty state systems of education that ensure 100 percent of all students passing one high stakes test
6148149 that measures of student academic achievement may include multiple question formats
6148150 shortfalls in state budgets coupled with pessimistic predictions about local revenues are forcing them to look for ways to trim next school years budgets and educational technology programs could be among the casualties
6148151 technology in education or instruction is more than the technical application of tools machines computers products and communication systems such as multimedia computerized instruction games simulations or interactive video
6148152 under no child left behind states are working to close the achievement gap and make sure all students including those who are disadvantaged achieve academic proficiency annual state and school district report cards inform parents and communities about state and school progress schools that do not make progress must provide supplemental services such as free tutoring or after school assistance take corrective actions and if still not making adequate yearly progress after five years make dramatic changes to the way the school is run
6148153 parents of children in low performing schools have new options under no child left behind
6148154 that was exactly what i wanted from the first round

6148267 the fpb took matalan to task two years ago for imposing a similar charge which it insisted was a one off clearly matalan has an ongoing policy of blatant and sustained abuse using its size and power to make more money at the expense of its supplier base
6148268 you enter into a contract and deliver the goods so it is not unreasonable to be expected to be paid for them agreement to a change of payment terms should be reached by both parties not just one

6148336 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6148337 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6148338 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6148339 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6148340 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6148341 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6148342 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6148343 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6148344 i recently read sears is teaming up with mtv to attract teens will this make mtv more or less cool
6148345 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6148346 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6148347 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6148348 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6148349 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6148350 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6148351 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6148352 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6148353 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6148354 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6148355 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6148356 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6148357 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6148358 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6148359 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6148360 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6148361 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6148362 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6148363 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6148364 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6148365 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6148366 who are open to doing something on the production side
6148367 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6148368 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6148369 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6148370 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6148371 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6148372 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6148373 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6148374 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6148375 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6148376 os tabus da minha terra porque e que as universid
6148377 gerida com nossos impostos e que levou mais de 25 anos para sair de maputo
6148378 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6148379 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6148380 i dont need to answer that you guys know that answer i am the best i just proved it at the olympics
6148381 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
6148382 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
6148383 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
6148384 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
6148385 cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
6148386 oh sure yeah kaine is definitely ready to fill out the ticket by appealing to white blue collar workers and latinos
6148387 respect and love begin with the self if we have none how can we give away any
6148388 her eldest sister vivien was at oxford city rowing club watching the race and texts were flying backwards and forwards between oxford and qingdao
6148389 she still has a lot of friends and family in the area and there was an immense amount of goodwill being sent from oxford
6148390 thank you to everyone for supporting me it was such a hard race and such a hard week and im just so happy its the best thing in the world
6148391 throughout school she was always really keen on sport and watersports in particular
6148392 she was incredibly focused and really determined in all of her studies and extra curricular watersports
6148393 she is well remembered as an incredibly passionate young lady who always wanted to do as well as possible
6148394 she won the oxford young sportsperson of the year in 2000 and got a small amount of money all this helps when a youngster is starting out in sports so we are very grateful to
6148395 she would be out on farmoor reservoir in the early days at weekends and in competitions
6148396 some of her early successes were around oxford which is pretty good going considering how far from the sea we were
6148397 the racing was very exciting she was first off the line and we were really excited
6148398 it is a complete rollercoaster when you are watching your daughter competing in something like this
6148399 and we got a call from our management telling us we were dropped before our album even hit the shelf
6148400 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6148401 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6148402 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6148403 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6148404 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6148405 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6148406 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6148407 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6148408 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6148409 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6148410 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6148411 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6148412 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6148413 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6148414 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6148415 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6148416 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6148417 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6148435 acredita se que nenhum outro homem tem a capacidade de exportar drogas da ndia despach las em maputo e entreg las no seu destino final na frica do sul
6148436 muitos compradores de mandrax na frica do sul preferem receber os comprimidos e fazer pagamentos na swazil ndia porque isto elimina duas travessias extras de fronteira para mo ambique e regresso umar tem um bom controle no aeroporto internacional da swazil ndia o que torna f cil para ele levar d lares e rands de regresso a maputo
6148437 que inclui a miami stores miami travel and tours miami exchange miami bricks taj mahal hotel miami fashion house e muitas outras companhias em mo ambique e no exterior

6148464 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6148465 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
6148466 i recall brian mentioning that he had a lot of largely instrumental tracks hed accumulated and since in his words he hates writing words i suggested i have a go at writing some words and tunes over a few of them and we see what happens
6148467 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing
6148468 this thought tapped into my long love affair with gospel music which curiously was inadvertently initiated by david and the talking heads
6148469 the live shows will maybe try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago
6148470 this number means more to me this year than ever knowing how strapped people are economically these days
6148471 the fact that fans are willing to both buy tickets and the gasoline necessary to come to a show is the ultimate compliment and i am so thankful
6148472 this number means more to me this year than ever knowing how strapped people are economically these days
6148473 the fact that fans are willing to both buy tickets and the gasoline necessary to come to a show is the ultimate compliment and i am so thankful
6148474 we are anxious to return this year with an amazing line up of artists
6148475 in addition to supporting rayville youth baseball and the steve colvin scholarships its a great to add habitat for humanity of ouachita and keep the focus on helping the local community im encouraging everyone to help us make this one of the most successful swampstocks ever

6148480 we cant wait to perform an entire aggro set back home and may even have a few surprises
6148481 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6148482 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6148483 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6148484 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6148485 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6148486 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6148487 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6148488 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6148489 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6148490 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6148491 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6148492 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6148493 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6148494 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6148495 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6148496 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6148497 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6148498 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6148499 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6148500 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6148501 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6148502 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6148503 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6148504 the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected which is an apparent violation of the airlines security program
6148505 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6148506 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6148507 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6148508 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6148509 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6148510 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6148511 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6148512 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6148513 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6148514 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly

6148546 i dont believe theres an impending catastrophe in front of us
6148547 certainly there are impacts and certainly there are changes that occur the environment has an ability to adapt to that
6148548 their intentions are good but i think their enthusiasm outstrips the logic of this situation
6148549 we have time to do this without upsetting the economy
6148550 we underestimate our ability as people and our ability from an environmental standpoint to adapt to changing realities
6148551 its not helpful to have the largest utility in the south saying we dont have to do anything about global warming

6148558 it was all pretty close going into the first beat and i knew exactly where i had to be but with the race being just one lap it was all a bit short and a bit rushed
6148559 because it was so close you had to go for it i went for it and i got punished a little bit
6148560 you only had to be slightly out of contention round the first mark and thats the race over really its just a shame it was one lap
6148561 this weeks been excellent really i sailed brilliantly this week and its just a shame that today went the way it did

6148565 we poker players dont call poker gambling it is a game of skill craps is an absurd game of luck you may have thrilling short term wins but only madmen play craps
6148566 the mccains own eleven houses and spent over 200 000 on household staff in 2007 so i suppose he can afford tens of thousands of dollars in gambling losses every year at the same time you wouldnt want someone to enjoy playing against the odds with the countrys public policy the fact that mccain seems to think theres some kind of betting strategy that can turn craps into a winning game also raises some questions about his math
6148567 over time he mccain gave up the drinking bouts but he never quite kicked the periodic yen for dice
6148568 only recently have mccains aides urged him to pull back from the pastime
6148569 he clearly knows that this is on the borderline of what is acceptable for him to be doing

6148573 when the doctors suggested that cannabis might be of benefit i wasnt sure but i knew i did not want to keep living like that within a week of taking it i started noticing a big difference i felt infinitely better
6148574 as someone who had never smoked or taken cannabis before i did not want to become addicted to it
6148575 there is a lot of controversy surrounding cannabis because it is an illegal drug but in comparison to other drugs it is quite tame
6148576 it does make me sleepy and hungry it gives me the munchies
6148577 patients should be able to get hold of a medicine without fear of being prosecuted putting people in jail for using a medicine that alleviates their pain and symptoms is totally wrong and against their human rights
6148578 it is hardly surprising that cannabis is having a proper medical effect on people who suffer pain
6148579 other drugs derived from opium like morphine have been used for similar purposes it is only when they are used improperly that the problems can occur like many drugs currently available on prescription doctors will need to use caution to ensure it is not being misused
6148580 we had some good results in our patients it helped about one in three
6148581 these are patients who have tried everything else so to get that kind of response can help a lot of people who have no other choices the type of people who use it to treat pain are totally different from those who use it for recreation

6148603 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6148604 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6148605 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6148606 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6148607 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6148608 today the republican leaders in the house are sending a letter to 22 of our democratic colleagues who say they want more energy yet they continue to vote with speaker pelosi to block our all of the above plan
6148609 they cant have it both ways either they are for more energy and vote that way or they are not and we are basically calling on them to put up or shut up make sure you are saying the same thing at home that you are saying in washington d c and reminding them that actions speak louder than words
6148610 if speaker pelosi refuses to reconvene the house we ask that you put your support for increased american energy in writing

6148622 if russia continues to keep these conflicts frozen unresolved and continues to prevent georgia from fully exercising its territorial integrity should georgia be disallowed when it comes to being invited to join nato just because of that
6148623 its got to be a consensus decision by nato theres a lot of other factors in play right now
6148624 the commission will review our cooperation with georgia following up from bucharest what happens between now and december will be relevant to the way nato decides about map
6148625 is georgia ready to become a member of nato nobody in april said they were ready to become a member now but we thought the way to help was to put them in a map that still has been our view we think thats the right choice

6148639 i notice that there are relatively few self declared muslims showing up in your poll statistics
6148640 i find the term terrorist most unhelpful it is far too vague
6148641 i disagree with your tactics but i wont fight you
6148642 that said there hadnt been many responses to the poll at all yet so the sample cant really be taken as representative of very much
6148643 and yet i would expect the percentage of muslim visitors to your site to be higher than the muslim percentage of internet users generally given the sites subject
6148644 ive heard it convincingly argued that targeting civilians in time of war for the sake of frightening an enemy into submission is a less common but nonetheless well used tactic historically speaking
6148645 a terrorist is someone who pretends to be a civilian and targets civilians is that un vague enough

6148649 im the british heavyweight champion of chessboxing because theres only been one uk title bout and i won it im over the moon and really chuffed about it now im going to take on the world
6148650 the majority of the time it ends up being decided by the chess element
6148651 however when someone gets the upper hand on the chessboard the other guy gets very aggressive in the next boxing round because he knows he has to go for a knockout but if youre getting punched and have all that adrenalin flowing the situation is a little different to your average chess game
6148652 im more of a chess fan to be honest i actually dont like boxing so the fighting rounds are a bit of a struggle i think the best chess player will probably win i dont think its possible to get a knockout at the moment were probably not going to see a lot of actual boxing tonight
6148653 we googled it and saw a few videos on youtube i last played chess about three years ago and ive never boxed before and id never seen a boxing bout live before i wanted to see the venue as well because someone said it was cool
6148654 its a really unusual event when i told people where i was going they just looked surprised i think it will spread through word of mouth and therell be more people next time
6148655 its choral music overlaid with the sound of crashing waves and seagulls you have to be able to switch off from the crowd noise if you can
6148656 some people were shouting out some really unpleasant stuff you could hear everything and it really put me off and then stewart would suddenly hit me there were one or two abusive voices out there but then this is a boxing crowd
6148657 the hardest thing is keeping focused on the chess because you get into the zone for boxing i lost my thread for a while during the later rounds
6148658 he was coming at me out of the shadows he hit me with a few punches but they didnt feel that hard
6148659 i need to stay out of range a little bit more in future he hit me with a lot of punches which i shouldnt have allowed him to connect with
6148660 my strategy was to play my chess slow and do my boxing fast i think tim was hoping to do the opposite i was trying to draw him in and make him miss before countering
6148661 i thought that if i hit him just right he might go down but he took some pretty clean hard shots he wobbled a few times but didnt give up
6148662 my friends all laugh at me they think its crazy theyre all asking when im going to sign up for cluedo judo or buckaroo tae kwan do
6148663 doing the two together is pretty challenging i think people have got to be realistic about themselves ive boxed before and i train regularly so im comfortable in the ring you have to realise it is real boxing and you are going to get hit
6148664 it was fantastic its such a strange juxtaposition its captivating but lo fi at the same time one of my friends in germany is a huge fan of this so i had to check it out when it came to london i really came for the spectacle

6148708 the biggest thing that changed the race was john mccains call for offshore oil drilling
6148709 it is not about offshore drilling per se but people are looking at the price of gas as the driving force in all conversations about the economy and the fact that john mccain was looking for a new policy that was aggressively trying to find new energy was a positive economic policy

6148733 wal mart has been taking many major steps to go green in recent years
6148734 so you can imagine my surprise when i came across comment on the federal trade commissions attempts to standardize carbon offsets
6148735 rather than attempting to define offsets or recs the commission should rely on the flexibility inherent in the reasonable basis doctrine different authoritative and expert institutions have adopted different but reasonable approaches

6148749 its like getting to the hard core of the problem by addressing the soft areas as an example of political discussion
6148750 process of political give and take which applied to the easiest place
6148751 should in a way apply to the most difficult place which is kirkuk
6148752 what i am hoping is that by october the options that we will be coming up will be taken seriously constructively by all parties
6148753 a political formula compromise will be identified in order to give a peaceful and fair solution for the future of kirkuk which then can be eventually sanctioned by a confirmatory referendum

6148781 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6148782 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6148783 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

6148794 fifa has asked the gff to name an alternative venue for this match by 26 august 2008 in order to be prepared should the situation in georgia still require a neutral venue
6148795 how clooney offers good friend obama advice on issues from body language to iraq
6148796 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6148797 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6148798 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6148799 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6148800 i asked to be released a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6148801 im gonna be 24 this year its a progressive age 21 i was finding myself and finding out the things that needed to be done as far as my career what needed to be done certain moves i feel like now im in a really great place cutting my hair i feel like im going to another level cutting my hair was a step for me anybody that has had hair for so long when youre used to something its like reforming your life
6148802 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6148803 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6148804 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6148805 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6148806 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6148807 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6148808 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6148809 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6148810 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6148811 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6148812 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6148813 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6148814 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side

6148819 un ejemplo de superaci n y perseverancia para todos los paname os
6148820 assis son poste lorsque soudainement une forte explosion a secou lh tel
6148821 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6148822 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6148823 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt looked that easy
6148824 character integrity hes been a winner all the way up
6148825 he has a lot of great features were really pleased
6148826 when you get compared to another player of trevors ability at a young age it goes a long ways i think it will make him a better player he takes everything in
6148827 character and leadership is i think what you can say about this individual
6148828 i think in this day and age that carries a player a long ways along with skill and ability theres no rush its not a race to get there for him itd probably be best for him to play at the junior level
6148829 i didnt meet my goals for the season i was looking to get in upwards of 20 points probably
6148830 at the end of the year i was feeling a lot better im just continuing to work out in the weight room and hopefully my experience and my strength will carry over from this past year into next year
6148831 im sure hed like to get there quicker but hes definitely a pure goal scorer its all about getting the opportunity when he gets the opportunity he gets those opportunities by his speed
6148832 what he does really well is he plays at a consistent level
6148833 thats what you like to see out of players you know what youre going to get out of him night after night i know hes a little older but he still wants that opportunity and hes showed when he has that hes really proven himself i think thats a real key for him
6148834 i think its in his hands like all these players
6148835 he has to improve on a few things to make himself better if he does then hes going to have a better chance hes got to come into camp with the attitude that hes going to take someones job
6148836 he was one of our better players from christmas on down in manitoba hes had a little taste of the nhl and knows how to handle pressure situations hes just got to take that step hes going into his third year pro and he has to go into camp and prove himself every night theres no easy nights for him he has the ability and the strength to do that its a push to take that next step and hes going to be pushed i know the coaching staffs going to be pushing him
6148837 i think things have happened very quickly for him and he has to play an all around game he has some skill but his all around game has to come into play hes coming along he looks really well with his conditioning
6148838 he makes easy plays all those sort of things you like in a solid defenseman i think the biggest thing is the way he competes he makes it miserable on whoever hes playing against
6148839 i think the biggest thing for him is to play a nice solid controlled game
6148840 he has a tendency to put himself out of position by just being over aggressive thats just a matter of time and learning as he goes along hes very solid and hes going to be able to shut down any of the top lines
6148841 hes a guy that competes every night you know what youre going to get from him hes a hard nosed miserable guy to play against he knows how to throw the better players off their game
6148842 hes gotten more ice time and he really improved as the season went along hes very solid and strong the skating is the tool he has to keep working on and hes improved in that area a lot from the start of the year
6148843 he came over from sweden to get to know the north american game
6148844 hes gotten more ice time and he really improved as the season went along hes very solid and strong the skating is the tool he has to keep working on and hes improved in that area a lot from the start of the year
6148845 he can shoot the puck a power play type of guy
6148846 the adjustment coming from college to pro is a big adjustment i think you saw it in his play earlier in the season but he really adjusted to it he picks up on a lot of things he really improved right around christmas he really earned his position to be the no 1 in manitoba going into playoffs he was very solid for us
6148847 where do you fit as a goaltender within our organization thats a big mental part of it but youve got to go out and prove yourself night after night you cant look at whats ahead of you you can learn from the guy ahead of you but youve got to be own self as a goaltender

6148870 i am absolutely disgusted i broke down in tears when i saw her
6148871 what kind of man could do this to an old woman
6148872 it is a good job she is tough because otherwise this could have knocked her for six
6148873 she has always prided herself on her independence and my main worry is that this will take that away from her
6148874 this was a shocking attack on a vulnerable old woman who was walking home from the post office
6148875 we believe he targeted his victim following her from the post office to the alleyway
6148876 to attack a defenceless pensioner like this is pathetic however this man is clearly dangerous and needs to be caught

6148895 were hoping to go back into the studio by january
6148896 my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne johns deli
6148897 yeah we all have our not so hot stories performance space 122
6148898 yeah we all have our not so hot stories performance space 122
6148899 ive had a very detailed presentation from a number of different people from operation cougar which is a multi agency approach that is very creative very innovative and on the face of it having an effect with not a single gang related firearm incident since february
6148900 whilst there have been a small number of firearm incidents since february i am assured that none of those have been gang related
6148901 i genuinely think this operation is really innovative and what they have done is creative with a really strong multi agency partnership and absolute commitment from the top including local authorities and the police and involving schools
6148902 they are combining i think three important elements there is high visibility policing and a very large number of searches in fact they keep searching the same people they want the message to get across that if you have a knife or a gun you will get caught
6148903 the second element is disruption tactics preventing people going into areas like the recent moss side carnival
6148904 they simply prevent known gang members from going in to the carnival
6148905 and then theres early intervention in which the younger brothers and sisters of known gang members have been identified they have been visited and their parents engaged for the most part i am told parents have no idea what their children are up to
6148906 they are engaged in positive activities and there is support for their parents the whole focus is on trying to prevent that younger brother or sister going the same way by giving them an alternative and giving them the confidence to withstand the pressure to become involved in gang activities
6148907 we have put in place another programme working with 10 authorities of which greater manchester is one
6148908 gmp has incorporated lessons it has learned from their approach to gangs and incorporated this in their focus on knife crime
6148909 we are encouraging forces to test the legality of knife sales
6148910 we are increasing powers of schools and teachers to search pupils and also introducing knife referral projects in those 10 areas for children who are in possession of a knife but havent used it they will go into a youth referral project which will be very intensive indeed
6148911 he has an incredibly long stride which affords him the ability to cover more ground he has been able to take that long stride that he has and combine it with technique and with his high turnover he can destroy the field
6148912 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people are seeing their incomes decline
6148913 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6148914 i will let no one question my love of this country
6148915 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6148916 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6148917 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
6148918 i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows

6148954 the true distinction between these forms is that in a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be extended over a large region
6148955 the differences of these two words is vast and profound

6148973 thoughtful column on this topic and nprs general reluctance to report on tabloid issues
6148974 reveal not the human frailty of the politician but their inability to react correctly in a crisis edwards like bill clinton could have admitted his failings from the beginning and move forward it is troubling that their first reactions are so dishonest and it is this that makes it newsworthy
6148975 is that it truly seems to be that edwards felt he was above it all in the same vein as jimmy swaggart just another cheesy wrinkled work out suit limping down the road how dare he challenge the rest of the country to shape up morally
6148976 i think you are dead on about the coverage of the edwards affair the criticism of the mainstream media for not covering the scandal is unwarranted the truth is that unless one of the two principals confirms on the record that there is or was an affair its all rumor and speculation
6148977 there are some attorneys here who are talking about a class action lawsuit against edwards if he would have won the nomination we dems would have been in deep do do in the november election
6148978 if elizabeth edwards knew about the affair since 2006 and still encouraged her husbands presidential candidacy then she is just as bad an enabler as he is proving herself to be so power hungry that not even a betrayal would be enough to halt their ambitions
6148979 you left out one key issue in the edwards debacle his lying which included the sainted elizabeth participating in the cover up
6148980 i dont care what he or she does in private between consenting adults even if it is a morally wrong choice because i want that freedom for myself and so how can i deny it to someone else having said that do i want to know when someone i am about to trust with the leadership of my country demonstrates beyond a doubt that they a lack morals b are a liar and c cant be trusted hell yes so where does that leave me i dont know
6148981 had he been elected president and someone threatened to blackmail him what is there that you think he would not have sacrificed to avoid the incalculably more important damage to be done to him and the country to avoid its revelation the fact is fairly or otherwise public figures cannot have a completely private life when they do anything that can have a huge impact on the public

6149004 investigation in ahmedabad blasts case has revealed that the accused persons are members of simi and some accused in this case have also been arrested in 2001 in surat under the provisions of unlawful activities prevention act
6149005 the said information has been made available recently by gujarat government to the centre
6149006 the fifth principle is the indispensable common sensical basis for human rights
6149007 by this point in our argument some are probably feeling impatient
6149008 from step 2 i deduce the third principle also as an immediate logical corollary that we really know what some things other things than apples really are this follows if we only add the minor premise that an apple is another thing
6149009 all talk about rights about right and wrong about justice presupposes this principle that we really know what some things really are
6149010 scientific ignorance if it is not ignoring or deliberate denial or dishonesty is perhaps pitiable but not morally blame worthy you dont have to be wicked to be stupid
6149011 there is obviously more mystery in a human than in an apple but there is also more knowledge
6149012 so they have to deny the moral principle that leads to the pro life conclusion this i suspect is a vast and major sea change the camel has gotten not just his nose but his torso under the tent
6149013 i think most people refuse to think or argue about abortion because they see that the only way to remain pro choice is to abort their reason first
6149014 knowledge and mystery are no more incompatible than eating and hungering for more
6149015 suppose that not a single principle of this essay is true beginning with the first one suppose that we do not even know what an apple is even then abortion is unjustifiable
6149016 lets assume not a dogmatic skepticism which is self contradictory but a skeptical skepticism
6149017 metaphysics means simply philosophizing about reality the sixth principle means that rights depend on reality and our knowledge of rights depends on our knowledge of reality
6149018 ah but i suspect we began with the controversial stuff
6149019 but its not wrong to break a limb off a tree
6149020 the main reason people deny that morality must or even can be based on metaphysics is that they say we dont really know what reality is we only have opinions
6149021 but the very fact that we argue about it a fact the skeptic points to as a reason for skepticism is a refutation of skepticism
6149022 for instance both pro lifers and pro choicers usually agree that its wrong to kill innocent persons against their will and its not wrong to kill parts of persons like cancer cells
6149023 and both the proponents and opponents of capital punishment usually agree that human life is of great value thats why the proponent wants to protect the life of the innocent by executing murderers and why the opponent wants to protect the life even of the murderer they radically disagree about how to apply the principle that human life is valuable but they both assume and appeal to that same principle
6149024 but harming or killing another against his will not by free contract is clearly wrong if that isnt wrong what is
6149025 the fetus doesnt want to be killed it seeks to escape
6149026 did you dare to watch the silent scream did the media dare to allow it to be shown no they will censor nothing except the most common operation in america
6149027 if you didnt see this then you dont deserve to understand my opinions
6149028 are persons a subclass of humans or are humans a subclass of persons
6149029 the possibility that there are nonhuman persons like extraterrestrials elves angels gods god or the persons of the trinity
6149030 or the possibility that there are some nonpersonal humans unpersons humans without rights
6149031 traditional common sense and morality say all humans are persons and have rights
6149032 modern moral relativism says that only some humans are persons for only those who are given rights by others i e those in power have rights
6149033 to be pro choice you must deny at least one of them because taken together they logically entail the pro life conclusion
6149034 but there are three different kinds of pro choice positions depending on which of the three pro life premises is denied
6149035 the scientific premise is that the life of the individual member of every animal species begins at conception
6149036 this truism was taught by all biology textbooks before roe and by none after roe yet roe did not discover or appeal to any new scientific discoveries
6149037 a statement which is pliantly true a proposition needing no proof or argument
6149038 in other words all humans are human whether embryonic fetal infantile young mature old or dying
6149039 the moral premise is that all humans have the right to life because all humans are human
6149040 it is a deduction from the most obvious of all moral rules the golden rule or justice or equality if you would not be killed do not kill its just not just not fair all humans have the human essence and therefore are essentially equal
6149041 do unto others as you would have them do on to you
6149042 i would not engage in homosexual intecourse therefore no one else should
6149043 i am personally appaled at destoying an embryo even though theres no logical basis against it
6149044 be nice to people if you want people to be nice to you
6149045 all humans have the human essence and therefore are essentially equal
6149046 the legal premise is that the law must protect the most basic human rights if all humans are human and if all humans have a right to life and if the law must protect human rights then the law must protect the right to life of all humans
6149047 if all three premises are true the pro life conclusion follows
6149048 from the pro life point of view there are only three reasons for being pro choice scientific ignorance appalling ignorance of a scientific fact so basic that nearly everyone in the world knows it moral ignorance appalling ignorance of the most basic of all moral rules or legal ignorance appalling ignorance of one of the most basic of all the functions of law
6149049 scientific ignorance if it is not ignoring or deliberate denial or dishonesty is perhaps pitiable but not morally blame worthy you dont have to be wicked to be stupid
6149050 a scientific fact so basic that nearly everyone in the world knows it
6149051 if you believe an unborn baby is only potential life or a group of cells then you do not believe you are killing a human being when you abort and might have no qualms of conscience about it
6149052 but why then do most mothers who abort feel such terrible pangs of conscience often for a lifetime
6149053 most pro choice arguments during the first two decades after roe disputed the scientific premise of the pro life argument
6149054 it might be that this was almost always dishonest rather than honest ignorance but perhaps not and at least it didnt directly deny the essential second premise the moral principle but pro choice arguments today increasingly do
6149055 perhaps pro choicers perceive that they have no choice but to deny the moral principle for they have no other recourse if they are to argue at all scientific facts are just too clear to deny and it makes no legal sense to deny the legal principle for if the law is not supposed to defend the right to life what is it supposed to do
6149056 so they have to deny the moral principle that leads to the pro life conclusion
6149057 this i suspect is a vast and major sea change the camel has gotten not just his nose but his torso under the tent
6149058 i think most people refuse to think or argue about abortion because they see that the only way to remain pro choice is to abort their reason first
6149059 or since many pro choicers insist that abortion is about sex not about babies the only way to justify their scorn of virginity is a scorn of intellectual virginity the only way to justify their loss of moral innocence is to lose their intellectual innocence
6149060 if the above paragraph offends you i challenge you to calmly and honestly ask your own conscience and reason whether where and why it is false
6149061 the most likely response to this will be the charge of dogmatism how dare i pontificate with infallible certainty and call all who disagree either mentally or morally challenged
6149062 all right here is an argument even for the metaphysical skeptic who would not even agree with my very first and simplest premise that we really do know what some things really are such as what an apple is
6149063 roe used such skepticism to justify a pro choice position since we dont know when human life begins the argument went we cannot impose restrictions
6149064 why it is more restrictive to give life than to take it i cannot figure out
6149065 so here is my refutation of roe on its own premises its skeptical premises
6149066 suppose that not a single principle of this essay is true beginning with the first one suppose that we do not even know what an apple is even then abortion is unjustifiable
6149067 lets assume not a dogmatic skepticism which is self contradictory but a skeptical skepticism
6149068 let us also assume that we do not know whether a fetus is a person or not
6149069 in objective fact of course either it is or it isnt unless the court has revoked the law of noncontradiction while we were on vacation but in our subjective minds we may not know what the fetus is in objective fact we do know however that either it is or isnt by formal logic alone
6149070 a second thing we know by formal logic alone is that either we do or do not know what a fetus is either there is out there in objective fact independent of our minds a human life or there is not and either there is knowledge in our minds of this objective fact or there is not
6149071 so there are four possibilities 1 the fetus is a person and we know that the fetus is a person but we dont know that the fetus isnt a person but we dont know that 2 the fetus isnt a person and we know that what is abortion in each of these four cases
6149072 in case 1 where the fetus is a person and you know that abortion is murder first degree murder in fact you deliberately kill an innocent human being
6149073 in case 2 where the fetus is a person and you dont know that abortion is manslaughter
6149074 only in case 4 is abortion a reasonable permissible and responsible choice but note what makes case 4 permissible is not merely the fact that the fetus is not a person but also your knowledge that it is not your overcoming of skepticism
6149075 i hope a reader can show me where ive gone astray in the sequence of 13 steps that constitute this argument i honestly wish a pro choicer would someday show me one argument that proved that fetuses are not persons
6149076 it would save me and other pro lifers enormous grief time effort worry prayers and money
6149077 but until that time i will keep arguing because its what i do as a philosopher
6149078 it is my weak and wimpy version of a mothers shouting that something terrible is happening babies are being slaughtered
6149079 the young of an animal in the womb or egg esp in the later stages of development when the body structures are in the recognizable form of its kind in humans after the end of the second month of gestation

6149084 im really happy with treo pro its a technology leap from a device design and capability standpoint enhancing palms presence in the windows mobile realm

6149097 comcast s claim that it has always disclosed its network management practices to its customers is simply untrue
6149098 comcast s first reaction to allegations of discriminatory treatment was not honesty but at best misdirection and obfuscation if comcast actually believed its practices were reasonable it should not have behaved in this manner
6149099 the very same act that established this commission as the federal agency entrusted with regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire
6149100 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6149101 we commend the commission for stepping in to preserve the public interest and addressing the substantial threat posed by comcast s conduct to the open character of the internet
6149102 i am not suggesting that mr shuler exerted any direct influence on this transaction
6149103 i believe the issue is the appropriateness of serving on an oversight body and then participating in deals involving the folks you oversee it is naive to believe that people would not know a sitting congressman owns a multi million dollar company or that indirect influence peddling is not alive and well in washington
6149104 wouldnt have used any position he has in congress to influence tva or anyone else
6149105 when a candidate has behaved illegally or unethically thats deserves to be a central issue but in this instance there appears to have been no impropriety
6149106 but shuler ought to remember that a lot of incumbents lost their jobs the day he won his because voters were fed up with the perception of congressmen cozy with washington regulators
6149107 there is no way that the people who actually looked at the information would ever know who owned it unless they went to the secretary of the state and asked who owned this corporation

6149174 often many gold medallists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6149175 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities

6149202 fino a quando leconomia continuer a peggiorare obama sar favorito perch gli elettori vedranno in lui luomo del cambiamento
6149203 gli elettori continuano a ripetere con forza che leconomia il punto chiave di queste elezioni
6149204 se guardiamo ai sondaggi si vede come mccain rimanga fermo nelle sue posizioni anche in una congiuntura economica molto sfavorevole
6149205 se mccain riesce a convincere gli elettori che terr bassa la pressione fiscale e aumenter la produzione domestica di greggio questo potrebbe avere la meglio sulle critiche ai repubblicani per politiche economiche sbagliate
6149206 nuovi fallimenti bancari e un peggioramento della crisi immobliare potrebbero aiutare obama i repubblicani a torto o a ragione saranno criticati per ogni problema economico
6149207 e una tendenza consolidata le persone capiscono che leconomia durante la presidenza bush stata debole almeno nel suo secondo mandato e questo sicuramente danneggia mccain in quanto candidato repubblicano e da a obama un vantaggio significativo perch lui pu sostenere che non continuer sulla strada di bush
6149208 credo che i prezzi della benzina continueranno a scendere fino al giorno delle elezioni e anche oltre e questo avr un effetto psicologico positivo sugli elettori ma non avr pi peso delle criticit nel mercato del lavoro non credo assolutamente che lelettore medio pensi che il peggio sia passato

6149236 we have to be prepared to talk we cannot afford to isolate russia
6149237 imagine if we were forced to intervene militarily on behalf of georgia as a nato country on behalf of an obvious gambler which is clearly the way one ought to characterize georgian president mikheil saakashvili georgia and ukraine must first resolve their domestic political problems and they are still a long way off i see the chances of georgian accession becoming even more remote as a result of the recent events in the caucasus and in this connection i have great difficulties following the rather ostentatious promises made by the nato secretary general a few days ago
6149238 the nato russia council is not just a fair weather committee it is needed when we find ourselves in difficult waters
6149239 isolation has been tried in the past and didnt work i favour hard headed engagement
6149240 horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
6149241 not only the west but the rest of the international community must make it clear that this kind of behaviour will result in ostracism and economic and financial penalties ultimately if russia continues on this course it must face isolation in the international community

6149259 those things say a correction is inevitable its price inflation

6149325 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6149326 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6149327 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6149328 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6149329 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6149330 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6149331 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6149332 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6149333 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6149334 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too janjua said but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6149335 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6149336 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6149337 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6149338 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her

6149343 there are many f1 drivers who are waiting for a win and there are f1 drivers like lewis that they came with very good package doing very good job and they manage to win straightaway so im pretty happy with what i have achieved but of course you always want more
6149344 to be honest i will be not disappointed if i do not become world champion because i think all drivers would like to be world champion but only one is winning and it is not only depending on myself
6149345 for me the most important thing is to be happy of what im doing because i can be quite negative to myself of what im doing how im driving
6149346 there are lots of drivers who arrive in f1 and you know that theyre good but they dont have theyre sort of missing an ingredient with some drivers but i think hes got that extra ingredient

6149363 people often claimed to have had only two or three good ideas in their entire career but each idea was so generative that it kept them busy for a lifetime of testing filling out elaborating and applying
6149364 there is no question that a playfully light attitude is typical of creative individuals but this playfulness doesnt go very far without its antithesis a quality of doggedness endurance perseverance

6149371 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries

6149375 all of a sudden from the fifth avenue side a huge number of police officers entered 56th street the protest was on the south side of the street we were standing on the north side of the street they came directly to us they were in riot gear and they surrounded us they made a semicircle around us shoulder to shoulder with their batons
6149376 he said you should have thought about that before you came out this morning it was like a dagger in my heart that a police officer of my city would come up with anything like that
6149377 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so

6149384 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
6149385 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies

6149404 if were going to live inside the suns atmosphere we need to learn more about it especially how to predict the storms
6149405 were going to launch a fleet of weather stations spacecraft that observe different aspects of suns atmosphere
6149406 solar activity is a bit like a puppet show if you want to understand the motion of the puppets you need to see the strings on the sun the invisible strings are magnetic fields they penetrate the suns atmosphere guiding the flow of heat and orchestrating mighty explosions sdo will be able to produce detailed maps of magnetism on the sun revealing the strings for all to see
6149407 right now sdo is in a thermal vacuum chamber getting tested for the rough ride to space
6149408 no spacecraft has ever been as close to the sun as solar probe plus will go only 7 million km from the surface thats unexplored territory and we expect to learn a great deal about the suns atmosphere by going there
6149409 imagine trying to figure out earths climate by watching only one side of the planet impossible yet thats what weve been doing with the sun
6149410 weve just finished the science and technology definition team report which lays out the whole strategy for solar sentinels

6149450 you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is whats happening to their mortgages whats happening to their gas and electricity bills whats happening to oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps
6149451 these are the issues they want us to address and look at you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6149452 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6149453 was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written
6149454 these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in
6149455 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion

6149457 there is no season when such pleasant and sunny spots may be lighted on wednesday 20 august 2008 by lisa and produce so pleasant an effect on the feelings as now in october
6149458 i have something quite odd embarassing private to ask tell you
6149459 just checking in whats up with you today put the axe down that spider is not that big
6149460 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time
6149461 totally unwilling to accept that a budget cant be done by labor day

6149468 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion
6149469 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6149470 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6149471 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it this platform we are at today sits above a field of 160 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing on a daily basis 55 000 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas
6149472 as infra estruturas urbanas est o em total degrada o quase em ruptura e os autarcas preferem ocupar se a propiciar negociatas aos seus apoiantes
6149473 the bill is totally unfair to consumers who own water softeners because most of the salinity comes from agriculture and commercial and industrial uses
6149474 theyre basically expanding the ability of cities and counties to regulate water softeners
6149475 i think were getting to the time where there are water conditioning devices that dont require as much salt
6149476 our position would be that we would work with the manufacturers of these conditioning systems to get there
6149477 in a sense state legislators are calling the manufacturers bluff a little bit by saying there are things that can be done
6149478 the older water softeners were real water hogs but all the new water softeners are extremely efficient
6149479 weve been working through a series of bills that have caused us to raise the efficiency of this equipment as an industry through standards thereby reducing water and salt use dramatically
6149480 it takes about 29 more energy to produce hot water in a water heater that is scaling than one with a water softener
6149481 it is great to attain wealth but money is really just one way and hardly the best way to keep score

6149484 it seems like every team ive been on its been like that
6149485 no one knew of kelly campbell so it was a matter of doing enough to compliment them and get some of the pressure and attention off of them
6149486 when dbs line up against him theyre scared they dont want to come up and press him if they miss hes by them
6149487 but it takes more than just speed he runs good routes he knows how to not let those guys get their hands on him so he can get downfield some guys have a lot of speed but they just cant get by the dbs
6149488 i noticed first thing when he came into training camp i had to start throwing the ball a little bit earlier to him because he was outrunning my arm i think hes the fastest guy
6149489 i get asked that question every team i go to brock has deceiving speed we may have to put up a race one on one just to see in minnesota when i got there it was whos the fastest between me and randy moss of course i said myself but we never got to race he would never race me to find out
6149490 as a little baby my momma told me all i wanted for christmas and birthdays was balls whether football soccer or baseball i wanted to have a ball in my hands 24 7 ive always loved football love the contact
6149491 not having my father around was really tough a lot of stuff i had to do on my own or my momma tried to be my father as far as me being in sports
6149492 i kept my head up my mom who is a minister kept me in church and kept my eyes open to god and god got me through to what i wanted to do get to the professional level of football
6149493 i wanted to work on holding my speed for a longer distance
6149494 i dont want to say hes faster because i dont know
6149495 but i think hes got more endurance speed wise he can hold his speed for a greater period of time his muscles are a little bit more elongated and its helping him
6149496 track is my no 1 love not a lot of people realize that
6149497 i was a pretty decent sprinter and a great hurdler my thought was if i didnt make it in football coming out of college i was going to focus on track i was running 10 5 10 6 in the 100 as a full time track guy without football and the need to run to classes i probably would have seen my times go down
6149498 but every athlete has a weakness and you have to work on them i started slow last year but i finished fast i just wanted to come into this season and set the pace from the beginning i wanted to carry my momentum all the way through to the end of the season
6149499 i believe if you put too much of a burden on the returner to be a running back its going to eventually affect him
6149500 im not saying this is always going to be the case but if we let ian focus on just being returner were going to minimize the hits he takes and keep him fresh
6149501 thats too expensive they cant afford it my customers would never pay that much or i cant sell something that costs that much more than the regular widget
6149502 7million will be a welcome change in mmos as it does not play in the typical fantasy or science fiction genre players with only a small amount of time will get their bearings quickly without missing out on all the fun of the game and the interaction with loads of other players

6149732 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
6149733 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
6149734 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
6149735 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that

6149751 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges
6149752 the thing that we tried to do is not play like every other team and play off the dribble
6149753 you cant win a ballgame in the first five minutes of the game
6149754 youve got to win it in 40 minutes so we understand that
6149755 we had one turnover in that first quarter and were only down one at quarter time
6149756 if you turn the ball over against this team theyre going to punish you
6149757 so were just going to continue to apply pressure for 40 minutes and wear you down if it happens midway through the first quarter great if it happens in the fourth quarter thats fine too the important thing is that it happens eventually

6149765 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
6149766 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out
6149767 the mind set for me at bristol has always been to protect the race car and get toward the end and then you really start to race these guys
6149768 sometimes you sneak up on them and dont press the go pedal until its 200 laps to go
6149769 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step
6149770 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
6149771 its a continued effort to find little things here and there
6149772 i dont think its going to be one little thing that puts us back in the mix its hard work commitment and the belief that we can get it done and get back to the top
6149773 my approach was simple when we won the championship it was consistency
6149774 we had nine finishes in the top 10 in the last 10 races and even though its a shorter quick run in the last 10 races its the same mentality and philosophy for 36 races and that is just go out there and get the best finish you can
6149775 you might want to take a few less risks but thats tough for a 24 year old to digest
6149776 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges
6149777 the thing that we tried to do is not play like every other team and play off the dribble

6149877 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6149878 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6149879 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6149880 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6149881 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6149882 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

6149888 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6149889 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6149890 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

6149892 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6149893 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6149894 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

6149897 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6149898 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
