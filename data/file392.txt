3920004 while amazon remains higher in hard fees their listings last longer and require substantially less interaction between sellers and buyers

3920006 don worked with many organizations throughout throughout the course of his life as an activist his level of involvement in each group varied from committed board member to a volunteer at a demon but in instantly his efforts were put forth in the spirit of solidarity based on his deep desire to bring justice to the world while the organizers strove to to include all of the groups and coalitions with whom don worked we are aware that some may have been overlooked and apologize for any omissions

3920011 what fascinates us most about china is what we see of ourselves in chinese culture people and places our delegation has opened up a window through which our students can better understand the world and their own place in it
3920012 i had a wonderful time in china it was great sharing with chinese students the mandarin that ive learned at school and i really enjoyed sharing our culture of aztec dance and drumming with them
3920013 throughout the program anahuacalmecac students were recognized by everyone for their mandarin ability and artistic skills
3920014 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3920015 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3920016 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3920017 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3920018 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3920019 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3920020 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3920021 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3920022 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3920023 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3920024 a soldier that refused to die when you were supposed to
3920025 what is really sad is that we got them home and now they are not getting the help that they need
3920026 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3920027 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3920028 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3920029 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3920030 i hate to see so many home and business owners who struggled to rebuild have yet another struggle to relocate
3920031 why tear down more homes if there is a site ready to develop
3920032 placing the hospitals within walking distance would greatly benefit medical students and residents
3920033 the same opportunity simply does not present itself when clinic locations are separated by a car ride
3920034 that medical complex was designed so we would have the forces of the two universities and the va doctors along with the bioinnovation and cancer centers positioned so this city would have one of the greatest medical complexes in the southern united states
3920035 the city of new orleans is pledging its resources to purchase only one site the site we proposed originally
3920036 many healthy downtown medical districts do not have a va hospital
3920037 lets be honest about this and get past the spin why choose a site which will destroy an intact neighborhood
3920038 we need health care now i cannot go to a civilian health care facility because they dont know how to handle veterans health care needs

3920049 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3920050 i was shocked and saddened to read what prince charles said shocked because it was so ill informed one sided and generally negative
3920051 saddened because the prince is in a position to lead this country in solving some of the massive problems he identifies he could bring together our world class scientists and agricultural experts to catalyse constructive debate and action that would benefit the uk and the rest of the planet
3920052 instead he indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood

3920130 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
3920131 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
3920132 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
3920133 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
3920134 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
3920135 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly

3920384 in terms of stability the mainframe is probably the best machine for transaction crunching we service 2 000 end users at any given time so having that kind of flexibility provides us with the ability to continue to support the health care environment while the mainframe processes applications and passes them down to other systems

3920410 theyre deliberately picking on me because ive got flags up and they cant put their ford flags and their chrysler flags up
3920411 i really do wish people would show a little bit more pride in america
3920412 in no way are we trying to do anything to prohibit people from displaying the american flag right now the question is whether or not our sign ordinance can regulate the display of the american flag for business purposes in terms of decoration on a property
3920413 i didnt ever really know what was going on over there

3920427 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3920428 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3920429 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3920430 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3920431 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3920432 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3920433 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3920434 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3920435 this would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate

3920439 reporting is the easiest thing in the world because there are no techniques to learn there is an attitude and that attitude is you have some information i desperately need that information and i deserve it thats the attitude it gives you the willpower to go up to strangers and ask questions and demand answers you have no right to
3920440 i blame it on these master of fine arts programs writers important writers used to come from all kinds of backgrounds in the 1930s they went to great lengths to stress their proletarian origins the cover of one of faulkners novels boasts that he is a former dishwasher and a former shoe clerk at saks fifth avenue these were terrible exaggerations but its true that if you lumped together all of hemingways fitzgeralds and steinbecks college educations you would barely reach spring break in the freshman year
3920441 all he had to say was i cannot believe what i am now witnessing members of the harvard faculty taking a grossly anti intellectual stance violating their implicit vow to cherish the free exchange of ideas going mad because a hypothesis that has been openly discussed for almost half a century offends some ideological passion of the moment acting like the most benighted of puritans from three centuries ago ransacking all that is decent and rational in search of witches causing this great university to become the laughingstock of the academic world here and abroad sacrificing your very integrity in the name of some smelly little orthodoxy as orwell called beliefs like the ones you profess im more than disappointed in you im ashamed of you is that really how you see your mission here if so you should resign now forthwith and take to the streets under your own names not harvards and forbear being so small minded and egotistical as to try to drag harvard down to your level ladies gentlemen kindly display your ignorance on these hallowed premises while holding aloft the flags the standards of this university be honest with yourselves even if you cant be honest with harvard look think and see what you have become that would have taken care of the whole thing
3920442 i do not agree with what you say but i will defend your right to say it
3920443 to me the most important thing right now is getting to know those guys what they run well just talking to them

3920446 it just doesnt roll off the tongue right now like im sure hed like it to but thats going to come
3920447 after you get used to being in a huddle saying it a few times going through the walkthrough seeing it on tape eventually it starts rolling off the tongue a lot quicker
3920448 a lot of the terminology is used in this offense but it means something totally different scat here is a totally different protection in fact its a max protection here where in green bay youve got five linemen so any blitz at all youve got to throw hard as soon as i hear scat im going blitz ive got to get rid of it

3920459 you live there and you hear about what the players talk about being successful and i think its a great place to see what it takes to win
3920460 the first step is our team is going to have the belief that youre going to win the stanley cup

3920562 im sure you saw that chemlawn van that cut me off i didnt want to hit the van
3920563 it all happened very quickly i just didnt want to hit the van
3920564 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
3920565 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3920566 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3920567 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
3920568 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
3920569 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
3920570 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are for all intents and purposes because of some timing they are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
3920571 theres no doubt that general motors realized the importance of positive media coverage with the prius
3920572 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3920573 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
3920574 you go girl he is looking at you damn girl he is all over you
3920575 hold up do these chicks think that a guy is doing me a favor by talking to me because im a big girl do they subconsciously think they are finer than moi because they are smaller
3920576 do yall really think that i have a problem attracting men hell i am prettier than all of you
3920577 am i always with her and do i take any
3920578 baby are you getting enough air here let me breathe for you
3920579 what man wouldnt want to see a woman being nurturing and loving
3920580 i should just give him some because he is handling his business
3920581 oh she is waaay to loving with that child and im not gonna try to get with that she wouldnt have time for me
3920582 we knew they laid their eggs among bank vegetation in the tidal areas of streams but its much more specific than that
3920583 whats important is what is happening underneath the vegetation the inanga new zealand s most common whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity
3920584 its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3920585 by and large it is probably smaller streams that are more vital for the health of the population as their spawning habitat tends to be more intact
3920586 the cost of fuel is clearly hitting new zealanders hard enough to make them change their behaviour
3920587 the fact that this latest poll was taken in winter is also interesting as youd expect people would turn to their cars more when the weather is bad
3920588 perhaps it shows that we often drive our cars short distances that could easily be walked instead
3920589 it is with considerable regret that i have accepted brian donnellys resignation
3920590 brian has told me that he feels his medical condition is preventing him from carrying out duties to his fullest ability and i respect that decision
3920591 i wish brian all the very best as he seeks treatment for his illness
3920592 his longstanding connection with the cooks gave brian a special insight into the uniqueness of the relationship between our two countries and the importance of maintaining the exceptional strength of those ties

3920594 substantially undervalues the company according to a statement issued by genentech
3920595 however the special committee would consider a proposal that recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership the statement added

3920637 the idea that working with the kernel community is hard to me is a myth or at least a misconception
3920638 it is only hard if you dont take the time to learn how the community works
3920639 whenever you step into a large organized operation there are going to be some ground rules and if you ignore those rules you will find working with the community very hard
3920640 my goal was driven by talking with folks that wished they had something they could hand out to companies and developers to see how to participate and get their code into the kernel
3920641 there is a lot of disagreement between the kernel development community and certain vendors who dont see the reasons or the need to incorporate their code
3920642 one reason is that code in the mainline kernel tends to be higher quality code
3920643 there are persistent concerns about quality control with some people feeling that were spending too much time merging new stuff into the kernel and perhaps not enough time fixing stuff that is already there
3920644 thats not a universally held opinion and its really hard to come up with objective metrics on whether the kernel is becoming more buggy or less so

3920669 ive always felt that hardcore punk rock was a world of its own a place to step away from society and that anyone participating in this unique way of life makes up a part of that community people like this and problems like these are the kind of things that build up walls and divide communities
3920670 the heavy update is the largest update to team fortress 2 since it was first released as part of the orange box last october
3920671 grayston l lynch fired the first shot during the 1961 bay of pigs invasion
3920672 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watch them grow up and now theyre raring to go
3920673 im really excited to see where they go and if theyll meet up with last years birds
3920674 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered propped up on white pillows
3920675 he tried to hit a nurse fortunately he didnt succeed for 24 hours a day this man shouted laughed swore and sang at the top of his voice
3920676 so effectively we had three other very ill men who had no sleep day or night
3920677 the normal practice if someone has died in a four bedded ward is to access a single room where the deceased could be viewed by the family and the family can have some time with the relative and for that to be done in as dignified manner as possible
3920678 this case highlights the campaign were running and highlights the kind of problems nurses come across because no nurse would want a deceased patient lying on a ward for seven hours
3920679 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
3920680 a new model for cancer care is required that addresses the whole experience of the patient and not just management of their disease
3920681 we have to treat the person as well as the disease this means that as well as making sure people in scotland can have the best medical management for their cancer we must also provide support for the social and psychological issues that people with cancer have identified as being important to them
3920682 everyone diagnosed with cancer wants the best possible treatment but they also want and deserve the best possible care they are not necessarily the same thing
3920683 any research which tries to truly understand and improve the experience of people affected by cancer is to be very much welcomed and encouraged
3920684 speaking as a person with cancer the report emphasises what the elephant in the room is surviving is of primary importance but the experience of this good bad or indifferent is not being used to shape the delivery of service and the survivorship of the treatment further
3920685 there is nothing to lose and everything to gain by including patient experiences at every level treatment management and how we as patients and survivors can contribute to research
3920686 although scotland has made significant improvements in services for people with cancer over the past decade it is evident from this research that in relation to improving the experiences of people affected by cancer more needs to be done
3920687 its a dynamic time for our organization and our art form
3920688 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3920689 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3920690 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3920691 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3920692 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3920693 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3920694 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3920695 there could be no happier moment in a persons life than the moment that they can see touch and hear their dreams for me this is that moment
3920696 they prepared her for war and combat but not the war in her heart
3920697 most of the songs were written with my dad keith and my uncle tim says the singer who cites trisha yearwood as an influence

3920699 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3920700 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3920701 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3920702 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3920703 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3920704 im worried youre going to see my bad grade on this and judge me because of it
3920705 its okay i promise i would never judge you based on the grades you make im going to judge you based on the clothes you wear to school
3920706 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3920707 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3920708 he asked me to prom but i know he smokes pot

3920721 seeing those panels starting to go up it was exciting for our team today
3920722 it shows the level of commitment that our administration and our supporters have and its going to make running through that purple smoke to play for the demons in turpin stadium an even greater experience for years to come there are a lot of people who played key roles and we especially want to thank mr burke for steering this project over the goalline
3920723 the scoreboard project is significantly enhancing nearly every athletic venue on the nsu campus save for the jack fisher tennis complex where an electronic scoreboard isnt viable due to the nature of the sport and the close confines and sight lines in the facility

3920729 genentech has actually gone out of its way to engage conversations with the activist community
3920730 we rarely agree but at least we can talk to them i have trouble imagining that will continue if roche owns the company
3920731 it isnt that big companies are evil and small companies are good but with big companies everything moves slower
3920732 our relationship with patients would be strengthened by this transaction
3920733 our combined much larger development organization would facilitate the management of a very broad portfolio of clinical trials improving patients access to new drugs
3920734 our concern is that with roche we could lose that relationship with genentech that give and take
3920735 in that moment of inexperience we listened we faced their anger we saw they had unique insights that complement ours
3920736 from this point on the relationship between genentech and the advocacy community has steadily improved
3920737 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
3920738 for where two or three come together in my name there am i with them
3920739 i think there are a few teams waiting on mats to see what he ends up doing
3920740 there are a few teams interested in parrish its preliminary mark is finding out what his interest is as well
3920741 mark is interested in vancouver vollan told cknw hes just sitting back and weighing his options hes just looking for an opportunity and a spot to help a team
3920742 you may have to take a step back in order to go ahead
3920743 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3920744 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3920745 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3920746 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3920747 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3920748 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3920749 ive been able to find what works and doesnt work and been able to do it on a small stage and not have to have the growing pains hopefully at the nhl level
3920750 the one thing about canadians is we love our sports be it hockey or football
3920751 despite me being in the nfl i was also a fan of the cfl so i understand that theyre loyal to their teams its ok if theyre going to be out there in protest but its all for a love of the game if you guys love football then support it
3920752 i know what its like because when i was coming up the browns left cleveland
3920753 somebodys got to be north americas team right it might as well be us
3920754 im looking forward to getting toronto people to believe in the bills and make it like a home away from home
3920755 i think people understand we have always tried to regionalize our product
3920756 they see what weve done in rochester where the bills hold their training camp over the past decade
3920757 were looking to do everything we can to keep the franchise viable and having a market like toronto that is so vibrant wed be remiss if we didnt reach out into it
3920758 we will stay on a schedule in terms of this game in terms of people we want to play and when we want to see them
3920759 but wed like to win it with whos on the field and were not going to change our approach to the football game
3920760 they are very aware of whats going on within our organization and what were trying to do in order to keep our franchise healthy and viable
3920761 we know we have a loyal fan base here and back in western new york
3920762 wed like to expand our fan base here and were excited about the opportunity
3920763 its a tremendous place so much culture with a lot to do
3920764 pre season games have been played in canada before but to a regular nfl season game were excited to be part of that a new introduction of nfl football to the canadian market
3920765 i dont know if were very good but i think well find a lot out in the first half this week
3920766 this is a big physical team that can rush the passer can stop the run and can run the heck out of the ball its the perfect team for us to be playing in my opinion
3920767 the next two games will be a big test for him to see where hes at all the stuff out here hes taken care of now lets see if he can carry it over into the game
3920768 were just going to try to get down to the bottom of it i still cant touch anything i cant put my hand down still very painful my main thing is even if its broken it doesnt mean anything if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts
3920769 its very evident you can see that so its definitely something that weve got to push through right now if we had more depth wed be able to take a little more time off and let stuff heal but its training camp we dont have many other bodies so weve kind of got to play through everything right now

3921004 were in work mode right now with summer school behind us and our guys are putting in some good reps we just need to focus on getting more consistent right now
3921005 the offense won a couple and the defense won a couple so it was a little more balanced out we had days early on that were one sided but today was more balanced i think we had two real good football practices today with a tired football team our guys are a little bit worn out but we still have a lot left to do so we just have to work at i like the attitude of this team right now though they have a good work ethic
3921006 i would like to see some improvement from the younger classes
3921007 we have older guys that are doing pretty much what we thought they would be doing at this point having good camps and making minimal mistakes i think the key to a season is to have the younger guys step up no matter how good your upperclassmen are you are going to have to play young guys at some point whether you are comfortable or not so i would like to come back to the office after the scrimmage tomorrow and feel like our young guys made pretty good strides
3921008 i think theyve got a chance to be among the best in the country
3921009 fonz is a great playmaker brandon may be more athletic than alphonso for his size and strength and speed alphonso makes plays and thats what we want brandon to do to start making plays if he does that opponents will have a hard time picking on us at the corner
3921010 not good ability but freaky good ability he has great foot speed

3921014 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3921015 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3921016 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3921017 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3921018 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3921019 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3921020 i have never in my life smelled anything like that
3921021 she told me they had a mother and four kids and apparently theyve been kept at home and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldnt let them leave
3921022 i have never in my life smelled anything like that
3921023 i want you to see this with your own eyes
3921024 usually i got a yard full of kids but ive never seen any of thurmonds kids come out and play

3921042 putting glenns number up with the other honoured players at rexall place is absolutely deserving and its the right thing for our organization to do
3921043 glenn could bring fans out of their seats with his unbelievable goals and they always seemed to be such timely goals especially in the playoffs
3921044 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3921045 the question continues to be are there republican votes for it
3921046 weve said to the governor what do you need in order to move forward so weve negotiated on that point
3921047 ill guarantee you that there wont be anybody in the house thats going to be happy with the conclusion but it is a compromise new revenues and program cuts and no borrowing
3921048 weve always said that were not doing anything that gives away the legislative responsibility for appropriating money in the budget
3921049 when we go for a vote were going because its a budget that the governor can get some votes for
3921050 this is a proposal that im interested in looking at and we will see if this in fact is what is brought to the senate for consideration
3921051 the people have sent each of us here to do a job
3921052 and i think establishing the fiscal health of california is about the most important job that legislators have right now
3921053 itd be a phony cap if anything and ive seen it all its all for a rainy day fund which is a good start but its not a hard spending cap that would solve the problem you can characterize it anyway you want but it is what it is
3921054 this is serious business instead of running ads about britney amp paris they should go talk to some energy experts
3921055 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3921056 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3921057 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3921058 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here

3921060 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
3921061 considering he missed most of last season we would hope that he would be injury free now
3921062 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the scottish cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
3921063 we will have some decisions to make for saturday davie is available again and i believe kenny and kevin will both be fine
3921064 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well kirk broadfoot has been playing centre half since pre season started more or less and he has been doing well too
3921065 i think it is his best position he played most of his games at full back last season because of the consistency shown by carlos cuellar and davie
3921066 the faw has agreed to give the georgia football federation a further 24 hours to try to resolve their travel issues for the match
3921067 talks have been held with the foreign office as the british embassy in tbilisi is closed due to the recent hostilities
3921068 georgian nationals must have a visa to visit the uk it is possible that the british embassy in baku azerbaijan may be able to assist
3921069 the georgians are still very keen to see the match played and the faw support them in that view however it is agreed that a final decision must be taken to give everyone as much notice as possible
3921070 it is a sad situation in georgia and i would like to thank fifa for thinking about that and we will wait to see what they decide
3921071 i know that fifa will think about the calendar and for me it is important that the game will be played on september 6
3921072 this is one of the biggest weeks of my time here at the club no doubt about it
3921073 the premier league is almost upon us but we have a big big game in iceland and these games could shape our season
3921074 a good start in the league is what every team is looking for and the right result here could set us up nicely for sunday
3921075 if you consider the difficulty we had in both games against odense until ashley young scored a fantastic winner you know how dangerous it is to take anything for granted
3921076 this is at the start of our season and in the middle of theirs and so they will be a wee bit fitter although that is less of a problem now than a few weeks ago
3921077 weve got a real chance to progress as a premier league side but because were in the throes of getting ourselves together for the season and they will want a big scalp we have to be aware of problems
3921078 it is like playing a lower division team in the third round of the fa cup tie and we all know what happened against leicester in the carling cup last season villa lost 1 0 in september
3921079 but we are in good shape and determined to get through to the main draw in the uefa cup and at least as far as the knockout stages
3921080 this season i want to be right at the peak of my game
3921081 because i worked hard i played for the team and yes i contributed in other ways and played quite well people praised some of my performances
3921082 but i wasnt at the peak of my game and thats the aim for this season to play at the best of my ability
3921083 thats something that i have to achieve now and i am under the right coaching staff here to help me do that
3921084 you have to be at your very very best every time you pull on the green and white hoops
3921085 for me its something thats inside me i want to do well as well as i can and i have always had that in me
3921086 i have been working with the manager over the past few weeks to try to do that because although i was playing in the middle and really enjoying it last season nakas shunsuke nakamura been injured and ive been out on the right recently
3921087 thats meant a lot of extra work with the manager and hes been trying to teach me how to play because when i was at my previous clubs i was given more of a free role in the wide areas and could go where i wanted
3921088 but when you are playing at celtic especially in europe against high quality opposition you need to be more disciplined
3921089 thats something i need to learn but its been going well working with the manager
3921090 i am not saying that im the finished article not by any means but i am going to keep working and hopefully get better at it
3921091 this season i will have exactly the same attitude at celtic you need to win every game and you have to have the same attitude in every single game to do that
3921092 i already feel quite good and there is a lot of optimism about the place
3921093 for me playing in this match would be special and if i can score that will also be nice but only if we win
3921094 i know a lot of people from my time at hearts and enjoyed playing football there
3921095 i had a good relationship with the fans and also managed to score quite a lot of goals some against celtic and rangers
3921096 but this is now in the past and all i want to do is score goals for rangers and help us win games
3921097 i want to show our great fans what i am capable of so all i can do is work as hard as i can in training and hope i am selected for matches
3921098 like every player i want to be involved all the time but we have a lot of forwards at the club right now and it is up to the manager what he decides to do
3921099 i was very happy to score my first goal at falkirk last saturday but the main thing was to get three points and make a good start to the season
3921100 we needed that after what happened in lithuania last tuesday we knew we had to turn things around so winning the game was the most important thing
3921101 i have to thank mr romanov in many ways because he trusted me and he put faith in me when i was at kaunas
3921102 i had to work hard to get my chance to go to hearts but when i went there i proved to everyone what i could do
3921103 now i am at rangers and i probably wouldnt be here if it was not for the opportunity mr romanov gave to me
3921104 i was thinking about my chance over and over again in my head and if i had scored the tie would have been finished
3921105 it hurt a lot and these things happen as a striker but life goes on and you cant turn back time
3921106 we have to move forward and make sure we improve and put all our fight and energy into the championship
3921107 nggak ada persaingan di sini kita seneng sama sama masuk nominasi
3921108 anak anak ada aja di rumah kemaren kak seto ketemu dengan al el dan dul

3921111 paula calls it a day or the company implodes on its own or a gun is put to wagners head by financiers and she greenlights things and then trusts in luck
3921112 paula wasnt greenlighting movies so she was about to lose a lot of the money her camp is trying to say mgm screwed up we didnt she did now mgm can get ua moving on at least 2 movies and make sure theyre released by a certain date to keep the financing intact
3921113 reading some of the older books on sf like dangerous visions cause it talks about how the old guard back in the day welcomed the younger writers and their revolution and even though they disagreed with them still read them
3921114 i want to know who are we talking about here what youre mad that a classroom full of college graduates havent read a book of fairy tales oh gosh oh noes yet i bet every one of them could tell you what a foucaults pendulum is
3921115 so for a writer the problem becomes do you write at the peak of your abilities and the highest peak of good grammar using the precise word and lose half your audience many of whom will say what a smartass using all them big words
3921116 or do you continue to lower the bar and continue to keep writing down to the level that you think is going to be receivable by your audience
3921117 i appreciate the new wave dangerous visions and etc for paving the way for what i write but then again at the same time they like to toot their horn a little too much
3921118 la intervenci n soterrada permitida por el presidente de la rep blica leonel fern ndez y las autoridades competentes aunque se diga que es colaboraci n entre gobiernos democr ticos y concepci n global de la justicia
3921119 este repudio y esta indignaci n se potencian cuando la injerencia y la presi n que la acompa an provienen de un r gimen criminal torturador promotor del terror de estado y del paramilitarismo comprometido en masacres espeluznantes y estrechamente asociado a los carteles de drogas y los planes de guerra de ee uu en la regi n

3921127 yo puedo ser una persona que no piense como piensa el presidente pero soy una persona decente ticamente respetable incapaz de hacer ese tipo de manipulaciones que ir an en contra no solamente de la verdad sino tambi n de personas que gracias a eso podr an tener consecuencias muy graves para sus vidas

3921137 if pixar doesnt get with the program were going to have to fundamentally change the way we do business
3921138 i repeat my recommendation to steve jobs that he pay john travolta and halle berry 20 million each to provide voices for an effects laden remake of the fox and the hound
3921139 we cant possibly be expected to stay in business when were up against a studio that doesnt have dozens of unqualified young executives with little or no background or interest in film meddling in the creative process of all their movies
3921140 it should be illegal for companies outside of los angeles to produce motion pictures
3921141 i was recently given the privilege of viewing dream on silly dreamer and i have to say how very human a face it puts on an institutional tragedy the slow cruel and insidious death of disney animation over the past several years under michael eisner it should be seen by everyone who still believes in the magic of disney these are the people who made it happen their treatment was appalling
3921142 every step of the way the project remained on schedule
3921143 the extended hours were deliberate and planned the management knew what they were doing as they did it the love of my life comes home late at night complaining of a headache that will not go away and a chronically upset stomach and my happy supportive smile is running out
3921144 what these employees are facing is totally a microcosm of the large structural trends that are impacting employees across the economy
3921145 employees are working more hours theyre getting compensated less and the power of employers is increasing compared to the power of employees compared to other countries u s workers work longer hours corporate profits are up and wages are continuing to stagnate even though were more than three years into an economic recovery
3921146 whats really unique about this is that these are highly skilled highly educated workers who are facing these issues who in the past would have been insulated from these broader structural changes
3921147 when long hours at a video game stop being fun
3921148 california law does not prevent people from having to work 100 hours in a week
3921149 theyre not going to change company practices in terms of excessive work hours
3921150 the only thing a court case might be able to do is get them compensation and thats not even a guarantee
3921151 first a lot of them still havent even accepted that its a problem and they cause a lot of grief to those who actually want to have families or social lives and still work in the industry that they love second the cowboy mentality thats been discussed seems to put this idea in developers heads that they need to be these existential heroes and sacrifice themselves for the good of video games everywhere the corporations feed off of these mentalities and use them to exploit people
3921152 i dont see them altering their basic mentality to suck developers dry the developers themselves will have to take a stand it would be nice if that stand could be taken without involving lawyers or unions but increasingly it seems that that wont be possible
3921153 there is no federal law that prohibits employees from working mandatory overtime
3921154 theyre just forced to pay them supposedly the employers are supposed to pay time and a half but if theyre characterized as exempt and forced to work overtime the employer wins its not an uncommon practice
3921155 in this country there are virtually no protections of any sort on workers time
3921156 its rather bizarre that a recent law passed in 2000 that limits overtime to 80 hours every two weeks is really for all intents and purposes the best that we do here in the united states
3921157 hire young programmers wow them with free laundry service and a free snack machine and then burn them out so what if you lose a few there will be more kids raised on the ps2 playstation 2 thinking they hit the motherlode when they are offered a job making video games
3921158 this is not unlike the way the music industry where i work operates many many interns and kids right out of college that we work to death there are always more right behind them
3921159 one of the biggest challenges is that most people are too passionate
3921160 theyre willing to sacrifice anything to get into it and have a go at it
3921161 under the labor code we believe that this class of employees is not exempt from the overtime laws and so that any work that they do in excess of eight hours a day or 40 hours per week electronic arts is required to compensate them for at the rate of time and a half
3921162 right now e a doesnt pay them at all for that time they get a salary that covers them 40 hours a week and any time that they put in above 40 hours is uncompensated
3921163 we dont have a legal claim in our case making out that e a has made people work some excessive number of hours and that in and of itself constitutes a violation
3921164 were just claiming that they need to pay the employees for the hours that they actually work
3921165 were electronic arts paying people overtime wages for the overtime worked you would probably see people working less overtime
3921166 thats just speculation but at some point its just not economical
3921167 i dont want to suggest that every single game studio on the planet is a sweatshop but thats something the industry as a whole is dealing with and i would not say its isolated to any one company
3921168 whether its rookies or veterans or whatever its proven that overworking your staff is not going to get good or productive work out of them if you send people home to have a life walk the dog see a movie and have a good nights sleep theyll be more productive after about eight hours of work you make more problems than youre solving by putting more bugs into the code
3921169 will overworking the employees be their demise we have no way to tell if eventually it will
3921170 eas attitude toward this which is actually a part of company policy it now appears has been in an anonymous quotation that ive heard repeated by multiple managers if they dont like it they can work someplace else
3921171 its the best of pixars six features and the first computer animated feature ive seen that gives me hope that the medium may eventually have the same capacity for artistic expression as hand drawn animation brad bird as writer and director surely deserves most of the credit for this breakthrough and probably all of it
3921172 the industrys not falling apart we traditional animators tend to stay stuck in the past we look at the golden age of disney and the amazing work done by those old masters we look at the recent renaissance of animation and look at the current masters and are completely enamored by tradition were almost stubborn to embrace new things as if it threatens our craft we think that the old stuff is the best stuff ill tell you now that bambi ii had much better animation than the original i know thats neverland that were far superior to the original peter pan granted the current incarnations had the benefit of what came before but we glorify the past so much that we cripple ourselves on top of that we look at the past and think that everything was nothings really changed the big difference is that we have a guild to protect us for the most part and that we have much more time on our hands to complain about it things sucked for chuck jones things sucked for walt things sucked for tex avery and things sucked for glen keane as well but we find solace in our craft our industry is hard with very little to show for most of us if you dont like it go to school and get a business or medical degree and thin out the herd for the rest of us second is watching the old disney family album of milt i mean we all know he was a genius theres nothing i need to say about his craft but he made a comment that really fueled me up especially on the coattails of what said he said animators tend to be solitary creatures its amazing that walt was able to bring us all together on one project and unify us to make something wonderful
3921173 i dont think anybody ever asked michelangelo this kind of question
3921174 although we kind of bridle a little at that phrase family entertainment
3921175 until very recently that was the only kind of entertainment there was this isnt some newfangled thing its the core of what human beings have done for each other for ever
3921176 no amount of good technology can turn a bad story into a good story and we just set out to tell a good story as well as we can
3921177 or at least from the outside it would appear to be boring you work on it for two years for maybe less than two minutes of film and im not really a patient person
3921178 you see the movie and its like heres my bit coming up heres my bit coming up and then its gone and its like well theres another one coming along in 30 minutes i dont know why its so satisfying really but it is
3921179 when we made toy story almost all the reviews only had one line about the fact that it was the first ever computer animated film
3921180 and the technical people here were immensely proud of that
3921181 we used to be proud of ourselves for saying story is king story is king
3921182 after a while we realised everybody else was saying the same thing too people repeat what you say but whats nice from a competitive point of view is that they dont repeat what you do
3921183 there is a contingent of the digital effects community to whom that is the holy grail to create photographically real humans
3921184 to me that is the dumbest goal that you could possibly have whats wonderful about the medium of animation isnt recreating reality its distilling it
3921185 here was this remarkable piece of new technology and we showed it to our community the graphics community people well equipped to ask us all about the splines we had used for example or these other really technical details
3921186 they should wait till they get older were getting some reactions from people who were disappointed that their four year old was a little freaked out by it well i dont want to compromise the intensity in order to please a four year old
3921187 i reject that whole point of view that animation is a childrens medium
3921188 the way people talk about it is well hey its a good thing i have kids because now i get to see this well hey no man you can just go and see it theres no other art form that is defined in such a narrow way its narrowminded and i cant wait for it to die
3921189 theyre used to hearing things they dont understand and in fact part of what makes life interesting for them is that theyre trying to figure things out so its ok to put things in a movie that dont make sense to them
3921190 you just have to do your very best your success cant be a function of somebody else screwing up were pleased when other people have successes too

3921220 the community is frustrated by what they see as a revolving door and not unreasonably from their perspective would like to see these individuals locked up for a long period of time to interrupt their criminal conduct

3921284 we understand that it has been a difficult time for people and were pleased that our extensive search for a medical oncologist has resulted in dr hadley accepting an initial three month contract
3921285 id like to thank tamworth hospital oncology patients their carers and the wider community for their understanding as we undertake the challenging task of finding a medical oncologist to serve tamworth hospital
3921286 we understand that the absence of a permanent medical oncologist may have caused some concern in the community but we believe patient care should not be compromised by employing anything less than a suitable fully accredited oncologist who is capable of making the right decisions for our patients
3921287 we hope dr hadley will find her experience with us rewarding
3921288 most recently dr hadley was a medical oncologist at st george hospital which is part of the south east sydney illawarra health service
3921289 the appointment of a full time permanent medical oncologist to provide services to tamworth is still our priority and well continue to provide the best service we can through calvary mater newcastle oncology department

3921306 we just stay motivated no matter what to keep creating conscious music for the people
3921307 were not trying to take what the pioneers set out with and change it for our convenience
3921308 we maintain within the principles reggae started out with our music has fusion in it but at the same time we try to keep it within the authenticity of how jamaican reggae was originally played
3921309 weve gone through a lot of drummers over the years
3921310 at one point we had like seven or eight drummers in rotation that we were using at our gigs
3921311 the way people come out and appreciate this band is just a great feeling all around
3921312 for our first album we went in with half the material and built the rest of it on the spot
3921313 we only created that cd so we could stop telling people we didnt have one up until then we were playing hot hot hot and all the bubble gum bob marley tunes and thats what that disc sort of reflected musically
3921314 the first five years of fourth dimension were based on us being south floridas top party band
3921315 thats what we started off as cause we didnt know this was going to be our future we saw original bands not getting no gigs cause nobody wanted to hire original bands especially not nothing that promotes consciousness
3921316 the owners of bars sometimes they just want that whole kinky reggae
3921317 they want the whole provocative forbidden dance part of it they want to see girls dancing drinking the guys drunk and when that happens the bar is making its numbers thats why they dont hire real dreadlock rastas to go out there and perform so weve had to come in like guerrillas almost playing an original here and there

3921327 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3921328 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3921329 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan

3921350 who would have known he always wore shoes so no one could see that he had four hands we all thought he was just kind of a loveable but ugly knuckle dragger sort of like arnold schwarzenegger and we assumed his odd musculature was simply the result of steroid use

3921374 who is the artist is he not a human being like ourselves with the added gifts of finer understanding and perception of the realities of life and the ability to arouse emotions through the creation of forms and images surely and this being so those who give their lives their knowledge and their time to social struggle have the right to expect great help from the artist and i cannot imagine a more inspiring role than that which the artist is asked to play for the defence and advancement of civilization

3921387 filling the conscious mind with ideal conceptions is a characteristic of western theosophy but not the confrontation with the shadow and the world of darkness one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light but by making the darkness conscious
3921388 these images are meant as metaphors to the dilemma of our modern existence they search for a dialogue between attraction and repulsion seduction and fear we are drawn by desire a chance at good living yet we are consciously or unconsciously aware that the world is suffering for our success our dependence on nature to provide the materials for our consumption and our concern for the health of our planet sets us into an uneasy contradiction for me these images function as reflecting pools of our times

3921390 when i find the novel on the bookshelf i want the sense from it that all plots are arbitrary and what matters is to begin to set out to begin writing and then to follow through this beginning being loyal to it letting the narrative reverberate with the origin it cannot reach i want to know that it is no plot that matters but another kind of intrigue in which writing has been caught by writing in which the origin is allowed to speak in what is only the beginning of a story an arbitrary story

3921393 in a very ugly and sensible age the arts borrow not from life but from each other
3921394 this is the crisis of modernism modern art used to reflect a radical way of thinking it did this until world war ii and then it gradually became more and more established eventually the radical thinking was totally removed from this people adapted to this said o k let there be say triangles but in the beginning painting triangles was a huge statement a daredevil act for good or for worse thats a different story but thats how it was but now its totally changed its meaning because its just a bourgeois business you produce pictures and you sell them you keep the form you can play with triangles endlessly but the meaning is lost so its a perversion of the intention of modernism and nobody cares the same thing happened with academic painting and ancient history nobody believed in it anymore nobody cared but still they went on depicting these beautiful women these mythological figures but it was totally obsolete it lost the common sense it lost touch with the people modernism was the idea to get back to some sense now it is senseless so we have to revise again

3921397 men like dogs and cats fawn upon you while you leave them on the ground if you lift them up they bite and scratch and if you shew them their own features in the glass they would fly at your throat and tear your eyes out this between ourselves for we must not indulge in unfavorable views of mankind by doing so we make bad men believe that they are no worse than others and we teach the good that they are good in vain philosophers have taken this side of the question to shew their ingenuity but sound philosophers are not ingenious if philosophy can render us no better and no happier away with it there are things that can and let us take them

3921399 the famous phrase the illiterate of the future will be ignorant of the pen and the camera alike is moholys it has gained its considerable currency mainly by way of its paraphrasing without attribution in walter benjamins celebrated kunswerk essay of 1936 moholys observation originally in english was written in 1932 and first published in a new instrument of vision feb 28 1936
3921400 as in music the point of life is its pattern at every stage of its development and in a world where there is neither self nor other the only identity is just this which is all which is energy which is god by no name
3921401 in a way art is a theory about the way the world looks to human beings its abundantly obvious that one doesnt know the world around us in detail what artists have accomplished is realizing that theres only a small amount of stuff thats important and then seeing what it was

3921437 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3921438 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3921439 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3921440 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3921441 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

3921460 but i could easily have been cast as some shitty zany neighbour on some show that really sucks
3921461 i was in edinburgh last year when it first aired when i went home i was like youve got to be kidding people were screaming my characters name i was so startled
3921462 they could be intimate and quirky all caterpillars and birds i cant do that any more no one can see that shit
3921463 surreal absurd and prop heavy i would like to move towards being more verbal because that stuff lasts a bit longer and then i could go on tour without having to pack a bunch of shit to take with me
3921464 i had a cinderella edinburgh debut someone brought me over and produced me thats luckier than a lot of people get
3921465 years ago i saw someone perform stand up and it looked so improvised and funny
3921466 i would always do new material wherever i went which was good because i got really prolific on the other hand i made a lot of bad shit
3921467 is something they dont expect theres all kinds of laughs but my favourite is the holy shit i never thought youd say that kind
3921468 i would perform in front of the cows they never mooed they never heckled they were very polite thats how i learned to not expect anything from an audience
3921469 and i looked at the cows again and thought god they have the same expression as audiences
3921470 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland bartelstein said
3921471 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3921472 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3921473 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3921474 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3921475 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3921476 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3921477 im not going to think about the future right now
3921478 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3921479 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3921480 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3921481 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
3921482 im looking forward to getting toronto people to believe in the bills and make it like a home away from home
3921483 its like electric around here said anthony antonelli senior marketing director for rogers media the canadian communications giant that is the series main sponsor
3921484 im not against the nfl or the buffalo bills its just keeping the cfl alive and the nfl in the united states halliday said who is selling t shirts featuring a bills logo with a line slashed through it
3921485 im all for it if it helps bring the fan base to the bills said joe dunham from norwich n
3921486 its a small market team and id say we need all the help we can get
3921487 thats what im afraid of i definitely dont want us losing them to toronto fleig said
3921488 i dont think the commissioners going to come in and tell the team the same thing that hes telling the people if it werent true moorman said
3921489 i believe what he says and i plan on finishing my career as a buffalo bill in buffalo
3921490 i wish the game was saturday instead of thursday to be honest with you but theres nothing i can do about that but it will feel real good to get out there again
3921491 i just felt like he couldnt run around girardi said before the yankees lost to minnesota 4 2
3921492 hell never tell you that he cant play but by saying that its kind of sore and its throbbing all night you kind of get the feeling that its pretty rough girardi said
3921493 the timing really is good with us celebrating our 60th year of racing next year browning said
3921494 although its not on labor day it is a 500 mile race at darlington browning said
3921495 and thats another way of our continuing to tie back into our history and our tradition
3921496 when i think of darlington and the history of the track the southern 500 is what comes to mind said driver jeff gordon who has won five southern 500s and seven times total at darlington
3921497 i look forward to the opportunity of possibly winning a sixth
3921498 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
3921499 i dont know why it is a big deal that ive been put on waivers thats nothing new lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like manny ramirez or me someone that people have an opinion about
3921500 i dont think anyone should read too much into this we certainly are not
3921501 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference the 45 year old gordon said
3921502 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3921503 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language snow said
3921504 i feel that my experience in providence will help me gordon said
3921505 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did gordon said
3921506 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3921507 ive been able to find what works and doesnt work and been able to do it on a small stage and not have to have the growing pains hopefully at the nhl level
3921508 the return to european cup play is important and the boys really wanted this win juventus coach claudio ranieri said
3921509 this is an important win but we have to be sure to concentrate for the return game
3921510 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3921511 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3921512 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3921513 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3921514 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3921515 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3921516 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3921517 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3921518 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3921519 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3921520 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3921521 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3921522 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3921523 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3921528 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3921529 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3921530 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3921531 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas

3921536 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3921537 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3921538 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3921539 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3921540 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
3921541 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
3921542 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3921543 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3921544 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3921557 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3921558 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3921559 he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug use extended into law school days or beyond
3921560 m y objection to what obama says is obama says well you know in college he it were he quit drugs my whole point of the book is self reporting from people they admit they use drugs is not reliable as to when they quit
3921561 this book is full of innuendos misstatements lies he says mr corsi says its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book let me see if you stand by some of these statements doctor obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs thats a lie the truth is that he said in his own book dreams from my father that he stopped when he got into college
3921562 he fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college

3921564 and because the purpose of ericom citrix r or similar software is to control and or standardize the user experience our symbiont stateless thin clients provide a perfect hardware complement
3921565 much as symbio recognizes the value of incorporating our application access and virtualization solution on its boot products ericom is pleased to be included on symbios innovative stateless computing tools and systems we look forward to a successful on going relationship with symbio
3921566 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3921567 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3921568 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3921569 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3921570 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3921571 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3921572 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3921573 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3921574 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3921575 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3921576 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3921577 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3921578 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
3921579 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3921580 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3921581 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3921582 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3921583 the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3921584 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3921585 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
3921586 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3921587 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3921588 it is simply not a requirement of this mission and it is not something we are seeking to do
3921589 might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3921590 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3921591 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3921592 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3921593 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3921594 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3921595 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat

3921603 i think the people of the state are really going to like it
3921604 i think its still a little strange to have potentially two people of the same party in the general election
3921605 i have a continuing concern with democrats or others who dont have the best interests of the republican party in mind selecting republican party candidates for the general election
3921606 deprives the people of choice in the guise of giving them more choice
3921607 we water down that debate and we water down those choices with the top two when you have two candidates from the same party in the general election and youre just arguing over which flavor of vanilla is the best
3921608 if youre a republican in seattle you may never get a chance to vote for a republican for the legislature because the top two candidates might be democrats
3921609 youre going to see people start trying to game the system and trying to get the right combination of people to file their candidacies to keep their strongest opponent off the november ballot
3921610 youre going to start seeing people who really are republicans run as democrats in seattle
3921611 the biggest impact is going to be the continued ambiguity over the role of the party in determining who their candidate is

3921645 when empty nesters choose a city for the first time in years it can be all about them
3921646 so we picked cities with a strong cultural mix as measured by the number of employees per capita involved in the perfroming arts we also identified cities with plenty of outdoor amenities such as marinas and golf courses because most people in the late summer of their lives already have good jobs and can afford more pricey housing we concentrated on overall cost of living rather than employment statistics and housing affordability
3921647 madison has always lured back hometown kids and uw madison grads but increasingly its attracting empty nesters who are ready to trade in the suburbs for easy urban living
3921648 madison offers plenty of amenities the arts ethnic restaurants pubs and shopping and includes the citys four in town lakes plus many parks and trails
3921649 although the state government and university still dominate employment madison is becoming a biotech center too

3921656 this is the first time i dont like the fans shcj so much
3921657 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
3921658 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
3921659 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
3921660 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3921661 i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily
3921662 so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy
3921663 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
3921664 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3921665 we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3921666 some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home

3921677 nanny sighting logo about 11 45 a m on monday 8 11 08 gladwyne pa i saw an overweight caucasian female with blond hair and a bad frizzy perm pushing a dark bluish stroller down conshohocken state road towards the post office she was wearing an indescript dark green t shirt jeans and white sneakers this road is only one lane each way with no sidewalks she was pushing the baby going the same way as traffic cars and trucks its a major thoroughfare were whipping around them i was sick when i saw this it may as well have been a freeway it is an extremely dangerous road there have been many accidents and deaths on it and it is very twisty as well the baby had light brownish blondish hair and looked not more than about a year old she had on a pink foral shirt denim clamdigger looking shorts and soft leather pink shoes they went into the post office where the woman spent quite alot of time baby was very antsy and unhappy the woman thrust a piece of paper at the baby in a very exasperated way to try to distract her not even a toy but a post office pamphlet or something to that effect as a mother i would never expect for someone to put my child in such a dangerous situation as this i am assuming this was a nanny as this particular location is extremely wealthy and she did not have the appearance of a resident
3921678 this post bothered me not because of the person pushing the stroller but the description of this individual and to automatically asssume it was a nanny because of her appearance that seems a little stuck up to me maybe shes a struggling mother who doesnt have a car at her disposal and she cant help it if theres no sidewalk maybe instead of writing on here you can call the town up and mention that you see people walking on the side of this dangerous road and suggest they put in a sidewalk thanks
3921679 appearance of resident stuck up sexually frustrated miserable human being and fyi darling while gladwyne is certainly no ghetto it is not nearly as nice or wealthy as you think it is
3921680 when we see people puttiing children in harms way or neglecting them we usually see them in the ugliest of lights thats the truth deal with it
3921681 im sorry but the author of this post sounds like a stuck up snob
3921682 you have been given one month to live you would like to do some things before you die what are they

3921686 das aufkommende f nf parteien system zwingt die spd zur linkspartei prinzipieller stellung zu nehmen
3921687 wenn sie es falsch macht wird es dazu f hren dass die linkspartei st rker wird als die spd in der neuesten umfrage ist der abstand bei 20 prozent f r die spd und 14 prozent f r die linkspartei schon auf nur noch 6 prozent geschrumpft insofern ist hessen eine art labor der ausgang wird entscheidenden einfluss auf die nationale politik haben da sollte sich niemand etwas vormachen und nach hessen kann der spd nicht mehr geglaubt werden dass sie etwas anders machen w rde als in hessen wenn es ihr keiner mehr glaubt wird sie es irgendwann auch machen denn warum soll man eigentlich den maximalen schaden von unglaubw rdigkeit erzielen um dann das was ohnehin alle erwarten nicht zu tun
3921688 wenn die gro e volkspartei spd ihre kernidentit t verletzt und zu einer randpartei w rde dann steht sie im wettbewerb mit einer anderen randpartei die k nnen beide durchaus stark sein aber ob dann der eine 17 und der andere 19 prozent der stimmen hat ist politischer zufall und abh ngig vom charisma der leitfiguren eine prinzipielle frage ist das dann nicht mehr man muss auch die gr e haben mit 35 prozent opposition zu sein und sollte nicht davon tr umen mit 22 prozent regierung zu werden die frage ist ob die spd noch die kraft hat sich der politischen geiselnahme von frau ypsilanti zu erwehren in jeder normal funktionierenden partei m sste ein machtwort der bundesf hrung einen solchen spuk beenden beck scheint sich nicht zu trauen und steinmeier scheint lieber auf appeasement kurs zu gehen als mit einem klaren machtwort seine kandidatur vorzubereiten

3921696 we got into islamabad and met with officials and diplomats in the day we then proceeded to lahore to get a physical demonstration of the security measures that have largely been recommended in various security consultant reports and observed them similarly weve observed them in karachi
3921697 there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3921698 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event
3921699 it is difficult to predict because the brief is to exist through to the end of the tournament it is a dynamic process if something different was to occur or the environment was to change then perhaps the task force may well re visit at this stage i cannot say but certainly the task force will exist to the end of the tournament

3921709 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3921710 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3921711 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3921712 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook

3921719 actually john i invited you to provide your credentials in science first and i took your silence as proof that you have none
3921720 john i will type this slowly because i know that you have comprehension issues ok
3921721 john many global warming suporters are ex comunists just look at they way the international socialists are always prominient at the demonstrations look at the memebership and agendas of the likes of sea shepard greenpeace peta et al
3921722 greenpeace is actually not interested in the economics of commerce
3921723 what makes you think that scientists are doing it either deliberately or even consciously i dont say they were doing it deliberately and it is not even about skewing results rather it is more about how the focus their energies and the topics they pick for research
3921724 if the piece at grods is any measure of your ability to
3921725 you clearly suggest that you have not watched tggws in this passage the film is riddled with numerous deficiencies inaccuracies and falsifications including invented graphs but that doesnt matter to the climate change skeptics denialists who continue to cling to it because its central hypothesis agrees with theirs dont pay any attention to documentaries that are so flagrantly inaccurate even the ones which have a central hypothesis that i agree with
3921726 strangely i have not ever received a cent from them you are the one now sprouting conspiracy theories because other sceptics are likewise not getting the cheques come on prove that the oil companies are there is absolutely no evidence that anyone is running the sceptics or their writing
3921727 exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3921728 the original article does not make any claims about the science beyond suggesting and i paraphrase
3921729 now you split hairs in warminist terms big oil is synonymous with both
3921730 can you prove that this was not just a very minor error and that it was presented with the intention to decieve proof beyond resonable doubt will do
3921731 durkin accepts that the time axis of one graph was incorrectly labelled when the programme was first transmitted but says that this does not change his conclusions
3921732 i told them how we were suddenly alerted that the village was forbidden and that we needed to keep crow and his friends from going there that was not right i faced the city council and told them crow was technically a citizen of the village and had every right to be there he could also bring friends if he chose to do so then i mentioned how the air sleds went back to the base and were severely reprimanded and ordered back out to bring crow and his friends back by force
3921733 they listened as i told them of the confrontation between howling wolf and the other villagers that offered to protect crow and the others i told them how i was there and that pressing the issue then could have resulted in injury or death to innocent people at the mention of howling wolf i saw several council members glance at each other and take stronger notice in what i was saying
3921734 i took advantage of that interest and told how the council of elders decided to send a delegation to talk with howling wolf and find out the truth of things for themselves
3921735 i then described the armed strike force i had seen waiting by an air transport back at the mountain complex when we returned i also told how we five members of the council of elders had been immediately arrested and held for an entire week without being told why the man in uniform was a pasty white by now and struggling for composure i told them how we tried every possible way to make contact with the city itself we needed to see if the city was aware of these things and if it supported them i told how the council of elders had tried all ways possible to reach the city but been blocked and told it was forbidden that is why in a last ditch effort we chose to fly a delegation over the city walls and speak with the city officials directly
3921736 there was a dead silence as the city council looked toward the man in uniform and waited for his response he was clearly uncomfortable and said that he was not prepared to respond to these allegations and needed to consult with his superiors
3921737 the mayor then asked what the council of elders would like to have happen i said the council of elders would like to ensure the safety of the villagers and howling wolf they would like communication between the village and the city so they could monitor and address any abuses that were happening i mentioned this could be done by opening communication lines to the city from the base in the mountain where we were stationed i concluded by saying this was a matter for the elders of the village the city council and our own council of elders and there were many things that needed to be discussed and brought out into the open we also wanted the rogue attacks to stop and whoever was responsible for them to be punished
3921738 the mayor looked pretty grim and told us the city council would need to do its own research and find out what was going on they also needed to hear from the federation and he looked pointedly at the uncomfortable man in uniform he suggested they adjourn until the next month and set a time to meet again here in the city and asked for a vote from the city council all voted in approval he then asked if the city council approved a direct communication line to be opened so the council of elders could contact them and keep them informed of developments again all voted in approval at that the mayor asked the uniformed person if it would be possible for the federation to open a communication channel for the council of elders or whether the city council needed to do it he saluted and said the federation would provide the link
3921739 then the mayor adjourned the meeting and escorted us back to our air sleds he told me we had done a very brave thing coming into the city and they would look into our story and be looking forward to our meeting next month
3921740 so it seems things are happening hopefully next month we will know more about what is going on

3921765 ragazzi ma io non ho portato la carta di identit un problema
3921766 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
3921767 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3921768 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3921769 there is no way i can volunteer between now and friday if that is the timeframe
3921770 the problem got worse today when i got three phone calls from three different people at the obama campaign office asking me to bring food for the staff i had signed up to donate snacks but i didnt realize i was supposed to feed the whole staff just thought youd want to know that the problem goes way beyond just the confusion about the tickets i have no idea how obama can win colorado when the campaign office is such a disaster
3921771 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3921772 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3921773 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3921774 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together

3921776 that as long as you can keep your enemies fighting you dont have to worry about them
3921777 you were not just my friend you were my only friend
3921778 i dont think enough was made of the fact that we are very serious laggards in terms of police officers doing duties which have long since been handed over to civilians in other jurisdictions
3921779 trying to portray the situation in a way that is some distance from reality
3921780 as far as civilianisation numbers are concerned we are some way behind the european average and have been extremely slow to embrace international best practice
3921781 the comments in the email refer to the historical situation and are not in relation to the current civilianisation programme under way
3921782 it is no secret that ireland has been behind other jurisdictions in terms of civilianisation
3921783 but both the minister and the department are completely satisfied in relation to the progress to date any fine gael comments to the contrary are completely wide of the mark
3921784 this is a wonderful organisation and each year they train 42 guide dogs and 22 assistance dogs for children with autism

3921786 he doesnt even have a comment or concern over the weekend my dublin central constituency saw a lot of flooding and i was on to county council officials with various responsibilities
3921787 a lot of those people were on holidays or on leave but they all without exception rang me back to say what their responsibilities were and what they were doing if local authority personnel are willing to do that how much more do we need from the minister
3921788 we need local government now and he is the man in charge the green party used to be about protecting the environment but it is also now about protecting people from the environment
3921789 the minister should come back from his holidays when something like this comes up
3921790 john gormley has learned with deep concern of the serious flooding affecting homes and businesses in east leinster and will be seeking in conjunction with the opw which has direct responsibility for the issue a full assessment of the damage caused
3921791 the minister said that every effort will be made to ensure cases of exceptional hardship will be reviewed sympathetically by the local authorities and the opw
3921792 i am extremely concerned that this theft of information could cause anxiety to our customers particularly our pensioners
3921793 i am also very concerned that we were not made aware of the nature and extent of the loss at the time of the theft
3921794 for all his problems he understands whats going on and he remembers sitting down with the taoiseach
3921795 as he sees it brian cowen is the king of the country thats what casey calls him he thought he was going to help but now hes let down a nine year old
3921796 im panicking now and im pretty concerned we came out of that meeting with the taoiseach and
3921797 i cant even bring caseys brother shopping for a new school uniform or casey will get upset i cant replace what hes missed that socialisation i feel the state has completely broken a promise to him at this stage

3921831 one of my primary concerns about teaching writing in online environment is finding a way to maintain appropriate humanity
3921832 when a mans partner is killed hes supposed to do something about it it doesnt make any difference what you thought of him then it happens we were in the detective business well when one of your organization gets killed its bad business to let the killer get away with it its bad all around bad for that one organization bad for every detective everywhere
3921833 theyre the rules that will keep you out in the world safe
3921834 the defeat will not meaningfully increase this years budget deficit but it nevertheless confirms a fading appetite among hungarians to continue with the consolidation process
3921835 then to decrease the deficit the so called solidarity tax was introduced however compared with vat which makes black incomes taxable the solidarity tax increased the tax burden on the visible incomes
3921836 due to the increasing tax and social security burden in 2006 and 2007 as was foreseeable the black economy grew corruption spread and foreign capital was reallocated into countries with a more investment friendly taxation system
3921837 it is still a crucial problem that the employment rate is critically low practically there are no incentives to self care and the population is aging fast
3921838 the reform of taxation in 2009 can only be successful if the measures to be taken will be based on these principles
3921839 the progressive reconstruction of the taxation system has become due and is now inevitable
3921840 although the continuous and steep price increases in hungarian property during last year has somewhat alienated foreign investors and also the upcoming new but already blooming markets in bulgaria romania and russia have enlarged the market and taken the focus away from hungary there is still a strong interest maintained for property investments in this country and especially in budapest
3921841 although until recently the majority of the investors were looking for newly built modern flats or whole buildings todays trend is mainly the purchase and luxury renovation of classic inner city villas and flats
3921842 the most significant property investors among our clients come from spain the uk and once again from ireland followed by their middle eastern and american counterparts
3921843 foreigners do not accept buda prices as they do not understand why they should pay more for them than for their pest counterparts
3921844 both newly built and used flats are most wanted in the inner districts and the luxury flats on the danube bank in district xiii
3921845 the most popular development of last year was surprisingly the olive garden in district viii
3921846 although it does not bring a significant fast yield on average an annual 6 12 revenue can be expected which is after all not a bad opportunity
3921847 unlike for example in spain or ireland there has not been a real market boom on the hungarian property market
3921848 prices have been very gradually increasing or decreasing always at a predictable rate
3921849 the pavement on the square is of western standards although we would need an additional ft200 million 714 000 to complete the squares refurbishment
3921850 parking is a burning question in this part of the city which is why there will be underground garages beneath liszt ferenc t r the zeneakad mia music academy and nagymez utca soon
3921851 the problem is that ownership of several buildings has not been decided here the municipality owns only a few buildings because it sold several of them so the properties future is up to the owners now
3921852 i think it is good that there are so many caf s in the square the more the better because they help each other
3921853 the municipality accepted the plan in 1996 in order to develop this part of the city into a culture and entertainment center
3921854 the tenants are still here in the building and would like to stay because i would not have a job at another location
3921855 this kind of apartment is not easy to find mainly because of the location and the comfort level there were quarrels earlier because the investors offered only ft80 000 285 per sq m right here in the middle of andr ssy t but later it went up to ft110 000 393 per sq m
3921856 nobody would move out for this amount of money i do not want to leave unless they offer me a two and a half room apartment
3921857 just because someone has the money he should not tread on other peoples lives
3921858 all the shopping malls in budapest have been designed with a similar interior with an atrium space so it makes sense to remodel the p rizsi nagy ruh z according to this pattern as well
3921859 this place will be worth its weight in gold in a few years when people leave shopping malls so it is a good long term investment
3921860 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3921861 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3921862 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3921863 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3921864 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3921865 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3921866 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3921867 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3921868 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3921869 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3921870 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3921871 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3921872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3921873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3921874 the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation
3921875 no i dont why dont you explain it to me
3921876 modern apartment blocks are now being constructed here in green surroundings
3921877 this really gives that part of the district an office and business character
3921878 the axle of my old trabant wont endure the potholes for much longer
3921879 in the north east of budapest you hardly ever hear of traffic jams
3921880 motorists would prefer to drive at higher speeds than tag along at 20km per hour in peak traffic
3921881 its all a question of money and although several investors have shown interest the legal procedures are complicated and return on investments like these take a long time
3921882 it would be good if the sportcsarnok was rebuilt as soon as possible
3921883 business for us here has dropped since events stopped being held there
3921884 we have to find a solution for how to separate the zoo circus and amusement park
3921885 why would the city create an artificial zone for something they cant even control in its natural location
3921886 the ground floors are for the public while everyone is building up up and up
3921887 a level or two of parking could be put on the existing parking lot and its adjacent bus terminal and the front area of the metro station
3921888 the state is the first to violate its own rules when it cant provide sufficient parking for its own facilities
3921889 citizens on official visits cant even approach government buildings by car
3921890 we must get rid of it its a disgrace to our town
3921891 we still have traffic going through it on one lane both ways during the week
3921892 why not if the park is less used during the week its only logical we should allow car traffic through
3921893 life is not a map we must learn to live in the dimensions and time around us
3921894 just give me a grade and lets get on with it
3921895 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license

3921937 if he testifies truthfully as he should he will implicate the defendant
3921938 a cautious prosecutor may well wish to avoid saying anything that implies that he knows what is actually the truth and an epistemologically sensible prosecutor may realize that he does not since he was not at the scene of the crime and relies on what others of varying credibility say they saw or heard and on arguable inferences from the circumstantial evidence
3921939 you will not enter this country while on probation to this court i mean youre not coming back into this country i dont care if you are a citizen i dont care if you have papers you have no business as terms of probation coming back into the country after what you did in this case so you will not re enter this country
3921940 there is certainly evidence to support the conclusion that while appellant drove on interstate 5 and the streets of oceanside in a stolen van with a highway patrol car only feet behind him he formulated the intent that if the officer attempted to stop him he would flee with a wanton disregard for persons and property the best evidence of this is that it is precisely what he did

3921954 i think we have better chances well work hard to win against ateneo
3921955 if you review the tape of our games weve been losing only in the final one or two minutes but in our overall assessment we still had a fighting chance even if we lacked players
3921956 well prepare for it hopefully well get lucky but usually when we go up against them we manage against all odds
3921957 im expecting that well play a lot better than that
3921958 im expecting well be able to fix whatever went wrong for the first time our transition defense was not very good and our defense off turnovers was not very good it will give us something to work on
3921959 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year

3921987 this raises the very real possibility that bruhaha could launch a terrorist strike on u
3921988 in addition the terrorists themselves could use the technology to create invisible clothing
3921989 they then could cloak themselves sneak up on unsuspecting women and slap or pinch their rear ends these poor women could go crazy trying to figure out who is accosting them

3922034 if anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words those of our lord jesus christ and with the doctrine conforming to godliness
3922035 and let those who have believers as their masters not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren but let them serve them all the more because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved teach and preach these principles

3922048 to keep silent to keep secret became silent 1 keep silent 3 kept secret 1 kept silent 2 quiet 1 silent 1 stopped speaking 1
3922049 and when the voice had spoken jesus was found alone and they kept silent and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen
3922050 and they were unable to catch him in a saying in the presence of the people and marveling at his answer motioning to them with his hand to be silent he described to them how the lord had led him out of the prison
3922051 and all the multitude kept silent and they were listening to barnabas and paul as they were relating what signs and wonders god had done through them among the gentiles

3922141 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3922142 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3922143 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3922144 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3922145 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident

3922147 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3922148 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3922149 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3922150 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3922151 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3922152 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3922153 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3922154 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3922155 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3922156 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3922157 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said

3922166 im going to keep it in perspective right now theres a war in georgia and people are dying and thats why this morning i felt so good coming in i just felt lucky im lucky that im alive first of all and lucky i can come and do my sport at the olympics it really sucks to lose its so painful but it doesnt make me more worthy or less worthy as a person its really just a match
3922167 it was just political everybody closes up before the olympic games i was just shut out of their system suddenly and unexpectedly and it was highly irritating

3922202 to date composition theory has helped turn on its head the idea that writing is only the recording or reporting of knowledge it has instead asserted that writing produces knowledge but it has not questioned the terms of the supposed relationship between writing and knowledge it has only inverted their order
3922203 davis asks what would happen if writing were dismissed from its representational servitude if that is we put ourselves in the service of writing rather than the other way around
3922204 theory of writing situates itself squarely within a strand of the philosophical tradition it might otherwise disdain

3922212 the narrative impulse behind the traditional rock formula that drives the bends speaks to my realism driven style of reading one that requires texts to be clear well framed windows onto a coherent objective event you know like folksy narrative rock songs ok computer complicates this in interesting ways by not only providing a commentary on our contemporary hyper media saturated frustrations but by also experimenting with more expressive and performative venues through which to enact those hyper media saturated frustrations kid a messes with this even further by embracing the artificiality of our hyper media saturated historical moment and providing opportunities to occupy expressions that are simultaneously deliriously happy and frustratingly violent within that constructed environment meanwhile amnesiac and hail to the thief ask us to shape responsible ways of living within those hyper media saturated conditions

3922255 teve bons e maus momentos mas que gostava de ficar amigo de carolina
3922256 para a altura da poca em que estamos demos o nosso m ximo este foi o primeiro jogo oficial da poca para n s e fiquei satisfeito com o que fizemos
3922257 domin mos grande parte da partida mas acusamos aqui e ali algum desgaste f sico e an mico

3922259 there is a lot of sensitive data on our laptops
3922260 besides the employees own personal information there are often product drawings and schematics these are highly confidential
3922261 in the past our security system didnt verify laptops as they re entered the corporate network
3922262 we had to hope that the antivirus and firewall werent disabled and were doing their jobs
3922263 now were not so worried about where those laptops go and what they do when theyre away from the office
3922264 stormshield gives us the ability to set dynamic policies such as prohibiting connections to ad hoc networks so we know we can trust that users are protected where they are most vulnerable outside of our corporate network
3922265 if antivirus is disabled for instance we have a lockout policy
3922266 users cant connect to the corporate network until it vets that machine and makes sure it is safe
3922267 and we know what exactly happened be it a misconfiguration a problem with a usb key or even a false alarm
3922268 its streamlined stormshield also serves as a policy generator for instance if we need to open a communications port for a new application we do it through stormshield before we had to go to every laptop to change the policy we can also monitor the status of the endpoints centrally to see for instance which laptop needs a critical update
3922269 with stormshield we can change policies based on user groups or context we can have one policy for when they are in the office and another for when they are on the road
3922270 and stormshield manages it all once we set the policies everything is taken care of

3922287 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
3922288 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind

3922307 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events

3922375 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3922376 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese

3922405 real estate agents across north county reported strong activity throughout the summer but slow sales in more affluent neighborhoods suggest that the flurry of activity was affecting only a sliver of the market low priced foreclosures and the increased sales were concentrated among bank owned homes as lenders continued to seize homes at a rapid pace

3922419 we are just in this morass with everybody else in the development business bruni said
3922420 for bruni the signals shes waiting for include steady housing prices and lenders who are not as wary of handing out money to housing developments after watching condo prices fall over recent years
3922421 its not because brooks properties arent strong enough or santa cruz isnt a strong enough market but the lenders arent strong she said

3922459 the worlds leading business newspaper has pegged merced as one of americas foreclosure capitals casting the citys housing woes onto an international stage the london based financial times story quotes local officials and real estate professionals who place much of the blame for merceds troubles on out of town speculators who snapped up houses during the 2005 boom
3922460 there should be a special place in hell for those people james marshall merced city manager says of the speculators
3922461 merced councilwoman michele gabriault acosta a residential realtor hadnt read the financial times piece but likened reports of merceds housing bust to coverage of the downturn detroit experienced in the 1980s during the collapse of the american auto industry you start to second guess whether its somewhere you really want to move to and bring your family to she said
3922462 this isnt the first time merceds real estate ups and downs have garnered attention from an international media outlet in july 2005 the wall street journal listed merced as the least affordable housing market in the country

3922758 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3922759 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3922760 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3922761 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3922762 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

3922770 were just very happy to become a neighborhood school and have all our neighborhood kids come back here also our returning students who want to be here
3922771 its still too soon to tell what my final numbers would be
3922772 some people who were not able to attend this school before because it is a magnet now have that option in the neighborhood
3922773 i think a lot of kids wanted to come here to begin with so that just makes them excited to be here

3922776 list of funny things that have happened in the office
3922777 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3922778 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3922779 all i can do is be me whoever that is
3922780 it will be a bunfight and cause a huge amount of stress among some families
3922781 i am extremely pleased justice has finally been done its been a long battle
3922782 but i am about to demolish one or two bottles of red tonight because it has taken such a long time
3922783 i can tell you i and my colleagues have been very frustrated by bureaucrats in canberra who would not believe the words of the people who fought in the battle
3922784 there was enough evidence gathered at long tan to raise serious issues as to whether injustices had been done in the awarding of gallantry medals
3922785 we didnt feel free in our terms of reference to recommend the setting aside of foreign awards guidelines
3922786 she and others were involved in a physical confrontation and altercation which ultimately led to her getting into her vehicle and striking five people killing one
3922787 as far as speed acceleration all of those things are under investigation
3922788 she carmen the progatonist has the most hilarious sexy dream that i have ever read and thats only topped by a sex scene that as i wrote in jennifer esteps blog is the funniest sex scene ive read since stephanie tried to get it on with joe the buick in one of the early stephanie plum novels
3922789 one thing that always got a chuckle from me was the amount of food that fiona has to eat to keep up her fiery metabolism you can almost read the wishful thinking that the author might have felt if only we could eat like this all the time and stay a size two or whatever size fiona is

3922799 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3922800 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3922801 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3922802 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3922803 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3922804 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odours
3922805 it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3922806 when you go through that its actually kind of draining you know to take all of that in but im very glad that i was a part of it
3922807 its rewarding for us to go visit those guys because it makes us appreciate those men and women putting their lives on the line to allow us to play this game
3922808 for the three three and a half hours that were there it takes their minds away from the injuries it takes their minds away from whats happened to them and they can just have fun
3922809 every time you watch the news you watch whats happening over there you really can relate how real it is
3922810 i got on the field today and am ready to get started the pirates are a great organization i think i am going to fit well here im just looking forward to getting settled in and start playing

3922812 ive had way more innings as a reliever i enjoy doing both and ive had mixed results doing both

3922816 upheaval particularly on economic growth and on the labour market
3922817 neither massive immigration nor an increase in the birth rate can turn the current trends around
3922818 quite alarming were seeing quebec facing real problems compared with ontario and the rest of canada
3922819 we have to act now to prepare the ground for the next few years
3922820 the annual increase of 5 per cent observed in alberta gives us an idea of what may lie ahead for quebec in the next decade
3922821 i know i have not been a regular blogger for quite a while but this new version really makes me anxious to get going again and become a more regular blogger who knew movable type could also help you with that kind of problem

3922823 just want to say wow the pro license is great exactly what was needed for many like me who has a commercial license but not a business and needed more than 5 authors
3922824 6aers mt team and community contributors thank you this is great work all should be congratulated but more important than that this is a fun new toy to play with yay
3922825 i am pleased that mt pro is being released as a free as in beer upgrade as it essentially replaces the previously paid for movable type community solution and it makes mt stand out more over wordpress which would probably need all manner of plugins to match mt pros full functionality
3922826 with mt 4 2 i see my company being able to add more interactive features easily as well be able to take advantage of php includes and the entire lifestream options
3922827 trust me on this one when they say they improved the speed of the system they meant it my movable type install is burning up the perl now
3922828 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
3922829 you are not ready to do anything but drink beer and party when you are 19 but you are thrust into the frying pan and you do what you have to do
3922830 running the company has been all ive known for 20 plus years
3922831 you could stay there and do well or make other moves and do great i never get complacent and i dont think ive ever been satisfied in my life so to put the business in a coast mode would not be my nature
3922832 im looking for motivated individuals who havent made a single dime online to partner with me and build a business that makes at least 1000 per month
3922833 the majority of product users are going to get it all wrong and it will cost them big time do not take this lightly
3922834 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3922835 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3922842 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3922843 courage demonstrates that both treatment strategies can have a profoundly positive effect on patients health status and suggests complementary roles optimal medical therapy as first line therapy with angioplasty reserved for patients who do not have a response or who have severe symptoms
3922844 gestational diabetes mellitus is a common condition affecting 2 to 4 percent of pregnant women
3922845 in summary women with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease events compared with women without gestational diabetes mellitus
3922846 as diabetes prevention interventions in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus have also been shown to slow progression of atherosclerosis this study highlights the importance of diabetes prevention for this high risk population

3922848 they werent really aware of what was wrong with them
3922849 they go to check on the other children that were in the upstairs of the residence and find them in the condition they were in unresponsive

3922860 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3922861 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3922862 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3922863 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3922864 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3922865 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3922866 there will be a number of options and you will be hearing more from telstra on that
3922867 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety

3922872 michelle kwan won no olympic gold medals but is an icon in the united states because of the way she carried herself and figure skating is a widely exposed sport
3922873 she is a much more beloved athlete than carl lewis ever was in the united states

3922882 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3922883 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3922884 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3922885 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3922886 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3922887 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3922888 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3922889 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
3922890 well what right do you have to speak about them then
3922891 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3922892 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3922893 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3922894 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3922895 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3922896 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
3922897 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
3922898 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3922899 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3922900 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3922901 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3922902 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3922903 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3922904 if green party values were now reflected in u s public policy

3922913 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun
3922914 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3922915 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3922916 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3922917 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3922918 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3922919 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3922920 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3922921 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3922922 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3922923 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3922924 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3922925 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3922926 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3922927 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
3922928 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3922929 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3922930 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3922931 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3922932 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3922933 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3922934 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3922935 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3922936 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3922937 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
3922938 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3922939 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3922940 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how o ba ba man wont be successful if he doesnt know how to be effective and he has no support
3922941 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
3922942 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
3922943 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
3922944 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole

3922952 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3922953 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3922956 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3922957 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3922958 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3922959 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3922960 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3922961 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3922962 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3922963 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3922964 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3922965 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3922966 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3922967 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3922968 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3922969 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3922970 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3922971 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3922972 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3922973 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3922974 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent

3922981 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3922982 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3922983 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3922984 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3922985 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3922986 who will be the next president of the united states
3922987 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3922988 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3922989 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3922990 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3922991 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3922992 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3922993 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3922994 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3922995 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3922996 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3922997 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
3922998 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3922999 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly

3923003 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3923004 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3923005 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3923006 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
3923007 im taking a major loss ill probably have to bring a check to the closing
3923008 the bank is willing to do a short sale and we have an offer of 170 000 on the house but we believe the bank will turn that down
3923009 they hand over their keys and walk away from the homes
3923010 it takes time for people to recognize that these losses are real
3923011 with 3 9 million unsold homes on the market prices will have to come down even more before the market stabilizes
3923012 och i samma stund v gar wolfgang trycka ut n bben och med kloka ord s ga
3923013 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3923014 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3923015 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science

3923017 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3923018 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3923019 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3923020 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3923021 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3923022 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3923023 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3923024 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3923025 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3923026 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3923027 hes a crybaby jon we are so lucky hes not our president
3923028 cause theyre real quiet you can go sneakin up on a mother
3923029 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3923030 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3923031 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3923032 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3923033 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3923034 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
3923035 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3923036 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3923037 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3923038 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3923039 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3923040 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3923041 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3923042 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3923043 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3923044 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3923045 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3923046 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3923047 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3923048 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3923049 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3923050 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3923051 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3923052 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3923053 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3923054 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3923055 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3923056 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3923057 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3923058 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3923059 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3923060 just so you all know we did set a record
3923061 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3923062 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3923063 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3923064 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3923065 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3923066 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3923067 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3923068 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3923069 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3923070 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3923071 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3923072 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3923073 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3923074 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3923075 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3923076 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3923077 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3923078 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3923079 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3923080 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3923081 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3923082 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3923083 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3923084 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3923085 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3923086 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3923087 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3923088 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3923089 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3923090 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3923091 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3923092 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3923093 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3923094 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3923095 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3923096 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3923097 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3923098 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3923099 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3923100 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3923101 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3923102 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3923103 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3923104 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3923105 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3923106 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3923107 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3923108 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3923109 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3923110 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3923111 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3923112 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3923113 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3923114 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3923115 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3923116 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3923117 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3923118 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3923119 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3923120 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3923121 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3923122 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3923123 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3923124 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3923125 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3923126 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3923127 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3923128 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3923129 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3923130 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
3923131 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
3923132 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
3923133 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
3923134 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
3923135 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
3923136 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
3923137 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
3923138 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
3923139 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3923140 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3923141 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3923142 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3923143 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3923144 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3923145 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3923146 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3923147 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3923148 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3923149 support the arizona republicans positions calling for the building of 45 new nuclear power plants and allowing oil drilling off of the nations coasts
3923150 that shows how out of touch he is with michigan voters
3923151 hes pandering to san francisco liberals and environmentalists who would just as soon we not have cars
3923152 believes that adding 45 nuclear reactors in the united states will help reduce dependence on foreign oil
3923153 my message here today is that we should take our lead from the french i never thought id say that
3923154 the economic cost of a cap and trade bill would hit michigan especially hard the increase in energy costs would compound the loss of manufacturing jobs in the state and reduce the disposable income of michigan residents
3923155 michigan would lose 37 400 to 56 260 jobs in 2020 and 91 490 to 121 786 jobs in 2030
3923156 im not a hypocrite i dont see things as right left i see things as right wrong so just because the people at fox like the sean hannitys of the world dont want to accept that theres climate problems theres enough information out there that im concerned
3923157 so al gore says were going to put a set of commercials together where two enemies get together on one cause and say lets support this so theyre going to get donald trump and rosie odonnell to do one and me and my arch enemy to do one
3923158 i gave them two dates because i was doing the movie and i was doing my family vacation and then i had to get the sound track ready for the movie get my album ready the 35 hits do a ford truck commercial and start rehearsing for the tour
3923159 just one of those unfortunate things it could still happen
3923160 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3923161 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3923162 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3923163 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3923164 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3923165 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3923166 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3923167 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3923168 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3923169 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3923170 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3923171 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3923172 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3923173 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3923174 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3923175 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3923176 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3923177 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3923178 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3923179 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3923180 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3923181 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3923182 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3923183 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3923184 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3923185 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3923186 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3923187 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3923188 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3923189 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3923190 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3923191 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3923192 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3923193 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3923194 in exchange for access to more dues units seiu gave california nursing home operators the
3923195 seiu also agreed to support legislation limiting patients right to sue over care abuses to oppose reforms to require better staffing for patients safety and to never report health care code violations
3923196 the insurance nightmare through establishing a high quality single payer healthcare system see http www guranteedhealthcare org blog
3923197 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3923198 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3923199 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3923200 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3923201 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3923202 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3923203 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3923204 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3923205 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3923206 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3923207 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3923208 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3923209 all that we are is the result of our thought
3923210 dien eerst je zelf van komt het ver dienen vanzelf
3923211 d r zijn mijn gedachten maar ik ben nu hier
3923212 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3923213 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3923214 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3923215 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
3923216 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
3923217 meanwhile the demand for takeaway pizzas and mcdonalds has risen as people find the cheapest way to eat
3923218 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
3923219 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
3923220 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
3923221 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
3923222 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
3923223 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3923224 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3923225 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3923226 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3923227 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3923228 my mother had moved up to iowa city just three weeks prior to the flooding and her house was wiped out

3923341 yo no s ustedes pero yo no s cual es la posici n de luis fortu o sobre la resoluci n 99 porque ha tenido como 99 posiciones diferentes la posici n nuestra ha sido clara desde el principio y est recogida en el programa de gobierno del partido popular sin ninguna controversia
3923342 la propuesta para una enmienda constitucional solo sirve para dividir el pa s y crear discrimen

3923349 i tried to get a ferry from nyc but they soon stopped from the pier i walked to as they all ran out of fuel
3923350 the queues were terrible people fainting everywhere from the heat
3923351 i kept thinking about the twin towers and how i would get down but everybody was calm
3923352 were slowly but surely coping with this massive national problem
3923353 its an experience that i do not think anybody would want to go through again willingly
3923354 it was a raging sea with enormous waves and one of them picked us up and laid us on our side
3923355 it is a tragedy as many people have lost their lives
3923356 but man is going to go on pitting himself against the elements and ocean racing will carry on
3923357 despite all efforts being made the probability of a successful outcome is not very high
3923358 this is an evolving record of information as knowledge is constantly expanding and new discoveries are being made all the time
3923359 i believe we will resolve these problems through the democratic process and that we will emerge with a democratic settlement
3923360 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
3923361 these services are all being sold to consumers as only providing real benefit no one is talking about the fact they are about building and collecting more data not just about the content you like but where you go and where you are at the moment
3923362 this is a way for the user to take their location to the web for every site on the web to become geo aware and to respond to where users are
3923363 switchboard that anyone can build on top of and we are the bit that helps connect to other services out there
3923364 fire eagle is neutral and open and the main thing we do is give people control to choose how much information they want to share and change it at any time
3923365 we only store your current information and dont keep any historical logs that information will stay there until you over ride it or change it
3923366 fire eagles features are beyond our comfort level as far as the average internet users is concerned
3923367 part of the problem is that yahoo cant control what the companies they partner with do with the information
3923368 while this is an opt in service you have to be clear about the consequences of what you are opting in to
3923369 people are social beings and people lie they tell fibs they want to buy presents for their partners go for job interviews and have secret and illicit affairs
3923370 people live rich and varied lives and its not our job to flatten that out we are here to make the world respond to you
3923371 if we get millions of consumers using the service and have thousands of applications we think it will be good for yahoo
3923372 we want our services to be location aware as well and obviously the more consumers that are willing to use it the more we will be able to tailor our services to them and the better it is for us
3923373 advertisers have yet to catch up to the possibility this space offers and fire eagle makes it that more explicit for them so i think we will see more targeted adverts coming into being that can take advantage of a persons location

3923382 our central view remains that inflation will fall back this year as the rises in domestic gas and electricity prices last year drop out of the annual comparison and the recent cuts in prices feed through to household bills
3923383 what we have seen in the past year or so is the culmination of a very large rise in energy and commodity prices
3923384 attention is now turning away from liquidity questions of funding and viability of an institutions business plan for some institutions that means they are over the worst and for other perhaps not but i think we have certainly moved some long way down the road
3923385 it is plausible to expect the underlying rate of growth of potential to be somewhat lower over the next few years and we have in fact made that assumption in the projections we have published today

3923591 he told us you have to go to the fields and play and respect the olympics
3923592 before the match we were talking to the georgia people
3923593 they were saying they wanted to be fully represented to show that the georgia people are warriors i felt the whole county cheering for us and we had to show that georgia people are fighters
3923594 yes i really felt like i was representing the people in georgia
3923595 i dont want to get political because this is the olympic games but down in my heart i wanted to beat russia for sure
3923596 they are not georgians they are brazilians and their coach is brazilian too

3923602 era come se avessi rubato qualcosa mi sono sentita molto umiliata tutti nel negozio mi stavano guardando come se dovessi venire arrestata cos dissi ad alta voce mi stanno arrestando perch allattavo il mio bambino
3923603 e una cosa normale non oscena e un bisogno del bambino quello di essere allattato e curato
3923604 non voglio vivere in un mondo o in una citt dove lallattamento al seno non considerato accettabile
3923605 siamo terribilmente spiacenti sembra ci sia stato un fraintendimento e una comunicazione erronea da parte dei nostri dipendenti la nostra politica quella di permettere liberamente lallattamento allinterno dei nostri negozi
3923606 il problema che alcune leggi pensate per favorire le donne alla fine si sono rivolte contro le donne la legge sulla maternit ad esempio che vuole garantire un anno di astensione dal lavoro una terribile trappola dobbiamo stare in guardia il congedo per maternit impedisce alle donne di fare carriera bisogna ripensarci la strada che per tanti anni abbiamo percorso e che ci ha portato a combattere per ottenere il diritto a stare a casa per occuparci dei nostri figli forse non la strada pi giusta
3923607 mai il diritto al congedo per maternit era stato messo in discussione da un organizzazione che ha come scopo quello di difendere i diritti delle donne
3923608 il mondo del lavoro negli ultimi anni cambiato radicalmente e quella che per le donne sembrava una strada senza pi ostacoli invece diventata di nuovo un percorso difficile
3923609 ora che sia chiaro a tutti che la famiglia un problema di tutti maschi e femmine
3923610 quello di cui abbiamo bisogno non di cambiare la legge che tutela la maternit ma la cultura di uomini e donne in azienda perch capita che anche alcune donne siano capaci di discriminarne altre per questo motivo

3923633 the best thing is being able to get off the dole i am a proud man who has never been afraid of work but nobody in the countless interviews i have attended has wanted to take me on
3923634 now i have got a couple of small business ideas i can afford to try out but i want to take my time and not rush into things i am still coming to terms with all the implications that go with the award i am also feeling a sort of peace for the first time since my arrest 15 years ago i am now slowly realising that i have a future after all and that is a great feeling
3923635 not merely an excess of zeal but a blatant attempt to incriminate a suspect by positive and deceptive conduct of the grossest kind
3923636 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the least 16 years but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that is something he will never get
3923637 he is not angry he is hurt and disappointed he is gradually getting his life back on track and this will act as a catalyst colin is realistic enough to realise and accept that his name no matter what happens will always be synonymous with the tragic events of rachel nickells death in some peoples eyes he will always be the bloke who got away with murder
3923638 our customers have to invest in assets right through the cycle so we are not exposed to the doom and gloom you are seeing elsewhere

3923643 the positive thing is that it is a good result but the performance was very bad
3923644 the passes were bad the control was bad and we were always losing the first and second ball i was a little bit surprised because we have been playing well the team didnt play well so the strikers keane and fernando torres were not able to play well i dont like to talk about one player but clearly we werent at our best
3923645 now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably
3923646 when we look at alliances in different regions we have had discussions with multiple companies in russia

3923659 the situation was 3 58 left ball on the minus 19 yard line they the chiefs offense were winning the game winning by two and the defense has three timeouts basically in that scenario what youve got to do is youve got to run nine plays and what the defense has to do is call their timeouts with the two minute in there its the first time we did it and we learned something from it
3923660 hes okay his hamstring is a little sore so we kept him out didnt want to take a chance hell be available for saturday
3923661 i dont know well wait till saturday to see if he does it wont be a lot of plays
3923662 yeah you always wish you had more but i think we accomplished a lot of things with a bunch of young guys i think the thing that i realized in practice when i watch these guys is theyre going to play physically they dont back down from that it was a very lively practice i thought it was the third day in pads and they got after it weve still got a long way to go we built the foundation of what we want to do offensively defensively and special teams now we have to continue to play in the preseason and start evaluating these guys and pick the best 53 players
3923663 he did okay hes a young guy we like him you know hes a young tackle and thats not always an easy place to play but hes got ability and thats why you draft a guy like that hes got tremendous size hes very smart he just has to play and hell get a lot of playing time in the preseason

3923677 therefore go and make people from all nations into talmidim immersing them into the reality of the father the son and the ruach hakodesh
3923678 because when the time comes the ruach hakodesh will teach you what you need to say
3923679 we are witnesses to these things so is the ruach hakodesh whom god has given to those who obey him
3923680 i am the good shepherd i know my own and my own know me just as the father knows me and i know the father and i lay down my life on behalf of the sheep also i have other sheep which are not from this pen i need to bring them and they will hear my voice and there will be one flock one shepherd this is why the father loves me because i lay down my life in order to take it up again no one takes it away from me on the contrary i lay it down of my own free will i have the power to lay it down and i have the power to take it up again this is what my father commanded me to do
3923681 for the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
3923682 adonai is my shepherd i lack nothing he has me lie down in grassy pastures he leads me by quiet water he restores my inner person he guides me in right paths for the sake of his own name even if i pass through death dark ravines i will fear no disaster for you are with me your rod and staff reassure me you prepare a table for me even as my enemies watch you anoint my head with oil from an overflowing cup goodness and grace will pursue me every day of my life and i will live in the house of adonai for years and years to come
3923683 may the god of shalom make you completely holy may your entire spirit soul and body be kept blameless for the coming of our lord yeshua the messiah

3923685 he himself bore our sins in his body on the stake so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness by his wounds you were healed
3923686 for you have made adonai the most high who is my refuge your dwelling place no disaster will happen to you no calamity will come near your tent for he will order his angels to care for you and guard you wherever you go they will carry you in their hands so that you wont trip on a stone

3923692 and i would argue more helpful to describe what grace feels like through stories and images that illustrate the varied ways grace is experienced when encountered in the wild than it is to attempt to define it conclusively to trap it or cage it

3923696 the greatest misconception about forgiveness is the belief that forgiving the offense such as an affair means that you condone it not true in fact we can only forgive what we know to be wrong

3923698 i think its because so many of us spend so many hours of so many days online doing things that make us feel ashamed of ourselves
3923699 it means that gay men who were once socialized in brick and mortar establishments surrounded by other people are now being socialized online

3923709 addictive like a slot machine you keep hitting next to see another screen of profiles thinking youre gonna get lucky sevens
3923710 variable payout schedule which is used in slot machine designs is the most addictive form of psychological conditioning because you never know when youll get paid it could be every 10 times you play or every hundred
3923711 every time you log on you never know what youll find thats why it expands to fill a persons time last night was a bust but who knows who will be online this morning or tonight
3923712 when we were teenagers when straight people were learning how to connect we didnt learn that
3923713 we learned that we had to survive on our own that means inside ourselves many of us dont have an innate belief that other people can meet our needs which means that we dont believe we can connect with them which means i have to rely on myself i have to live on my own and there i am in my bedroom all by myself and the computer is in the far corner and all i have to do is turn it on
3923714 the nightmare that gay people always have just underneath the surface the fear that im just my dick im just my body im just my age it reduces everybody to statistics youre presuming that nobody will love you for yourself if youre offering yourself as just a bunch of statistics
3923715 there was a lot of camaraderie that used to happen at the bars

3923727 our second quarter results and strong year over year improvement in both our top and bottom lines are an indication of our increasing national leadership in the industrial repair and service industry
3923728 the increase in our service based revenues shows not only our ability to win new contracts and take advantage of the growth in the wind generation industry but that our reputation for efficient on time and on budget service is gaining recognition
3923729 we see great opportunity with american motive power the rail services business we acquired in the first quarter of this year the integration and ramp up of this business has been more difficult than anticipated however we expect it to start producing positive results in the third quarter
3923730 we have made a number of positive strides in the first half of 2008 that have resulted in new contracts and enhanced financial performance and we are seeing the growing benefit from our recent acquisitions our entry into the wind generation industry last year in particular is paying dividends as we continue to see an uptick in the industrys need for nationwide maintenance repair and remanufacturing services
3923731 our results reflect our ability to effectively control costs improve margins and win new contracts across all our segments
3923732 as our results show we continue to experience the benefits of increasing name brand recognition which is enabling us to gain market share and compete for larger contracts
3923733 we are beginning to see the results of a number of strategic initiatives put in place earlier this year by our veteran management team in addition the recent hiring of ed matheny as ice president of sales and marketing for rrm and michael stefanik as director of wind power solutions provides us with the added expertise and depth of management that we believe will enable us to continue growing what we see as high margin opportunities within the multi industrial fields

3923760 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3923761 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3923762 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3923763 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3923764 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3923765 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3923766 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3923767 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009

3923773 the uncertain economic outlook will provide challenges in the current year and we expect to see pressure on volumes and tonnage in print and distribution amp fulfilment pmps chief executive brian evans said

3923793 i was pleasantly surprised when i could not find a single statue or billboard representation of raul or fidel castro not only in havana but anywhere in cuba
3923794 we had retail sales that were in line with expectations so not earth shattering but being in line with expectations is not good enough these days so that was a further threat to equities
3923795 the markets were due for a correction because of falling crude and falling commodities but these are not good enough to lift markets because prices are still above levels seen last year

3923800 hey mister i have to know who sings this song
3923801 oh come on the song that is playing right now this beautiful song it is sooooo good i have to get it who sings it
3923802 this is a beautiful song i do hear it it is one of my favorites
3923803 i turn to you to calm the wind and rain to accept what i can change to feed my soul with faith i turn to you
3923804 does this woman look like the right picture for what you are hearing
3923805 my source of strength my point of light my ray of hope my peace of mind my silent voice that speaks the truth when i need truth i turn to you
3923806 your heart is clear it brought you here it heard the words and it lead you to this place it led you to the beautiful vision dream you are having you let your mind and the images you have shoved into you all the time lead you away from the truth that you were seeking you asked god who was singing this song because you wanted to be able to recapture this feeling when you wake and that is pure the problem is the answers you seek are not in your book
3923807 the answers to the questions your heart poses are not in your book
3923808 one mans humble quest to follow the bible as literally as possible

3923811 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3923812 if your life was a picture what would it be would it be posed and
3923813 the first laptop case company to have fulfilled the design and testing requirements to be travel sentry approved
3923814 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
3923815 in a time when more and more families are uninsured and feeling the financial strain of a bad economy its pretty incredible that the bush administration is actually trying to put up roadblocks for women trying to access basic health care
3923816 and will be fighting to preserve womens access to health care information
3923817 who will i marry shaun cassidy leif garrett or david cassidy
3923818 i think the worst is behind us for the banking industry
3923819 we still see big increases in loan losses in areas such as home equity auto and probably credit cards
3923820 but if you look at the structure of the industry you see theres more equity in banks than the last couple years their deposits are rising their reserves are higher their loan volumes are growing
3923821 its just that you have this terrible loan loss problem
3923822 its like the old clich that the pig has to go through the snake when we finish with this loan loss problem i think youll see that these big banks are in pretty good shape
3923823 given the structure of the u s banking system you probably have a couple hundred banks that are at risk of failing
3923824 you have to look at this way there are roughly 7 200 banks in the u s now the biggest five banks have 52 percent of the industrys assets
3923825 you likely will see failures among the 6 000 banks at the bottom but if you add their assets together they dont equal those of citibank
3923826 i think its fair to say which banks might fail
3923827 one ummah our land is one our war is one our peace is one

3923868 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3923869 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3923870 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3923871 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3923872 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3923873 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3923874 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3923875 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3923876 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3923877 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3923878 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3923879 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3923880 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3923881 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3923882 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3923883 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3923884 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3923887 i would hope that we cannot be afraid to keep our doors open and welcome everyone in
3923888 one of the things we all face as people who are in the public eye is that when people get disenchanted with something thats going on in their life they sort of pick someone out to take that out on

3923890 the packaging and decoration of the ferrero rocher chocolate which were peculiar by virtue of the arrangement and combination of their elements in respect of word design color shape and size produced a distinctive overall image in addition these packaging and decoration were unrelated to the functionality of the product and had been advertised for a long time and to a great extent so that the relevant public could associate their overall image with the ferrero rocher chocolate product these packaging and decoration could serve to distinguish the origin of the product therefore they should belong to the peculiar packaging and decoration as set forth in article 5 2 of aucl furthermore the packaging and decoration of the ferrero rocher chocolate were used earlier and montresors assertion that it had originally designed the packaging and decoration on its own was not supported by sufficient evidence
3923891 sufficient to cause relevant members of the public to mistake the origin of a commodity including misrepresenting the relationship or association such as suggesting licensing relations or business operators of well known commodities

3923901 and on top of that someone has been pawing through the cucumbers
3923902 police are dismayed at the utter stupidity of a man who decided to play chicken on the tullamarine freeway
3923903 thats just the fuckin way the world works it sucks
3923904 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
3923905 these services are all being sold to consumers as only providing real benefit no one is talking about the fact they are about building and collecting more data not just about the content you like but where you go and where you are at the moment
3923906 this is a way for the user to take their location to the web for every site on the web to become geo aware and to respond to where users are
3923907 switchboard that anyone can build on top of and we are the bit that helps connect to other services out there
3923908 fire eagle is neutral and open and the main thing we do is give people control to choose how much information they want to share and change it at any time
3923909 we only store your current information and dont keep any historical logs that information will stay there until you over ride it or change it
3923910 fire eagles features are beyond our comfort level as far as the average internet users is concerned
3923911 part of the problem is that yahoo cant control what the companies they partner with do with the information
3923912 while this is an opt in service you have to be clear about the consequences of what you are opting in to
3923913 people are social beings and people lie they tell fibs they want to buy presents for their partners go for job interviews and have secret and illicit affairs
3923914 people live rich and varied lives and its not our job to flatten that out we are here to make the world respond to you
3923915 if we get millions of consumers using the service and have thousands of applications we think it will be good for yahoo
3923916 we want our services to be location aware as well and obviously the more consumers that are willing to use it the more we will be able to tailor our services to them and the better it is for us
3923917 advertisers have yet to catch up to the possibility this space offers and fire eagle makes it that more explicit for them so i think we will see more targeted adverts coming into being that can take advantage of a persons location
3923918 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

3923928 although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term managing director robert elstone said

3923930 the performance of asx during the difficult market conditions of fy08 underlines the resilience and diversity of the groups business model mr elstone said

3923932 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious

3923937 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3923938 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3923939 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3923940 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3923941 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3923942 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3923943 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3923944 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3923945 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3923946 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3923947 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said
3923948 say goodbye to the myth that oil demand and gas demand will soar regardless of the price the evidence is more than clear that oil demand is on the wane demand destruction is the word of the day as the evidence of that destruction permeates all around us
3923949 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3923950 my personal view is that this isnt a random attack
3923951 there is a reason for these two people to go to the address there is a motive behind it
3923952 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3923953 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3923954 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3923955 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3923956 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3923957 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3923958 there will be a number of options and you will be hearing more from telstra on that
3923959 we had retail sales that were in line with expectations so not earth shattering but being in line with expectations is not good enough these days so that was a further threat to equities
3923960 the markets were due for a correction because of falling crude and falling commodities but these are not good enough to lift markets because prices are still above levels seen last year

3923963 the current administrations policies regarding sexual health education have fractured efforts to provide a cohesive structured and successful hiv aids prevention program promoting abstinence at the expense of condom use has forced many state governments and nonprofit organizations to go it alone when it comes to combating sexually transmitted diseases

3923967 free seven day account that requires you upload content but then up charges 29 95 for full access memberships
3923968 the site clearly is not a service provider as defined by the dmca they do not qualify for dmca safe harbor protection and are fully liable for all the content on their website

3923983 dave is the rate the number 1 concern at this point or is it the ability to actually secure the financing at a payment that fits into your budget
3923984 dave many of my current clients said exactly the same thing when i first met them when i did i recent informal survey to ask why they left long term relationship to come with me the top two answers by an overwhelming margin were 1 the fact that i used to be a cfo so i really understand their issues and 2 they appreciated that i am a specialist not a generalist in fact 100 of my clients are contractors like yourself which of those two resonates most with you
3923985 dave xyz deserves a lot of credit for their market share but the question you have to ask yourself is what is more important going with the biggest company or going with the company that has demonstrated its abilities and performance so well that 3 people i highly respect have chosen them
3923986 i know iiiiii couldnt do it cause id be pms ing and freaking out all the time
3923987 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
3923988 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3923989 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3923990 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3923991 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3923992 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3923993 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3923994 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3923995 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3923996 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3923997 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3923998 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3923999 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3924000 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3924001 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3924002 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3924003 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3924004 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3924005 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3924006 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3924007 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3924008 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3924009 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3924010 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3924011 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3924012 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3924013 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3924014 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3924015 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3924016 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3924017 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3924018 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3924019 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3924020 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3924021 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3924022 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3924023 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3924024 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3924025 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3924026 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3924027 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3924028 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3924029 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3924030 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3924031 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3924032 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3924033 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3924034 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3924035 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3924036 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3924037 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3924038 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3924039 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3924040 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3924041 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3924042 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3924043 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3924044 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3924045 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3924046 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3924047 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3924048 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3924049 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3924050 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3924051 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3924052 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3924053 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3924054 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3924055 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3924056 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3924057 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3924058 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3924059 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3924060 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3924061 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3924062 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3924063 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3924064 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3924065 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3924066 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3924067 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3924068 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3924069 who are open to doing something on the production side
3924070 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3924071 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3924072 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

3924131 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
3924132 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
3924133 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3924134 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3924135 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3924136 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3924137 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3924138 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3924139 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3924140 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3924141 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3924142 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3924143 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3924144 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3924145 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3924146 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3924147 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3924148 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3924149 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3924150 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3924151 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3924152 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3924153 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3924154 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3924155 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3924156 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3924157 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3924158 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3924159 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3924160 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3924161 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3924162 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3924163 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3924164 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

3924207 we dont have much leverage because russia now has recovered from its economic collapse
3924208 it seems to have stabilized its position in chechnya and its not exposed elsewhere in the world it has a trade surplus it has oil and gas and it is very hard i think to find leverage to use against them at this point
3924209 the russians have a naval force the black sea force that is based in sevastopol and that theyve used as part of the blockade of the abkhazian coastline or the georgian coastline
3924210 but of course it means that were in the same body of water and i assume theres no implied threat that we would try to interdict naval movements on the part of the russian black sea fleet
3924211 hopefully this is being in some way coordinated with the russians
3924212 it does show that we are on the brink of something serious small conflict people didnt care about south ossetia and yet those small conflicts can bring two superpowers into conflict and create tremendous instability in the world
3924213 you have to have the approval of all the other countries and i think theyve been neutralized effectively in part because almost every one of them at least in europe have become dependent on russian oil and gas
3924214 and there is no doubt in my mind that prime minister vladmir putin is aware of this and president dmitri medvedev certainly is aware of this because he was the head of gazprom which was the source of supply of so much of that natural gas
3924215 if all the key players beginning with moscow and then europe and then the united states washington do not keep their heads if they react intemperately on any part and dont have a longer term vision react only to immediate events and do so with inflammatory language and maybe even with impetuous steps retaliatory steps things could get much worse
3924216 kalau memang vonis dijatuhkan saya meminta supaya sheila bisa keluar dari penjara untuk menikah dengan anak saya
3924217 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term
3924218 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3924219 its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i changed numbers id have to change all that no good
3924220 the alternative of that is taking the mound when games dont count and youre not in anything and thats not fun at all so i love the pressure
3924221 i wasnt a big red sox fan in the offseason
3924222 i was up 3 1 and had a chance to win the world series so i had to work through some forgiveness issues there and it took about five minutes because i couldnt wait to get over here put on this jersey and have a chance to make the playoffs
3924223 i hear hes a boots guy so i might have to get him a couple pairs of boots maybe a watch
3924224 it was really nice i didnt know if the number was important to him or not but its been my number for a while so it was nice of him to give it up
3924225 my thorny sharp clawed 21st century brainchild to be enjoyed in a cozy dungeon with a crystal divinatory pendulum and a cup of catnip tea
3924226 my other tools were a zoom effects box a gorgeous shure old time radio style mic a four track an alesis hr16 drum machine and an alesis quadraverb
3924227 i always used my tibetan bowl and incorporated my cats unique siamese wails into the mix i fed vhs porn moans through the effects to create an eerie soundscape i used my voice in odd ethereal and percussive ways i reverse engineered when i used my old desktop i worked exclusively with acid sample looping software but only made wav files and goldwave edit pro for effects
3924228 how i used it was fairly typical in a technical sense and it was so simple stick a tape in plug in record but my stars was i a piece of work i lived in this converted sorority house that was inhabited by ucb students i wasnt aware of it at the time but it was their finals week and i was up at all hours caterwauling into that thing
3924229 i must have recorded all the melodic tracks during the day those poor kids thought i was blaspheming on drugs or having a psychotic episode i recall wailing about vampires choads and chex mix i was inspired the warm analog quality was absolutely divine my building manager was cool he wanted me to show him how to use it
3924230 after the performance is captured the 424mkiis new three band eq with sweepable midrange will enable you to contour the sound with far greater flexibility than was previously available
3924231 i loved my alesis i used it for my vox and it was fun and friendly well i did get obsessive with it but thats a tribute to its flexibility
3924232 id run my vocals directly through the quadraverb sometimes i felt it was a channel to enlightenment
3924233 protea will live on and ill have the tattoo to show for it i am in the process of recording a concept album about the ancient egyptian pantheon with a very modern setup and id like to get it signed this diy stuff is getting old thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to talk rather seriously about gear
3924234 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years

3924236 hey do you want to buy some condoms we have them 10 for a dollar

3924239 yes they are actually used to treat many medical conditions like endometriosis
3924240 change is what new krypton is all about one hundred thousand more kryptonians hes no longer the last son of krypton
3924241 obviously its going to affect his life especially when they all say hey were on new krypton earth is new krypton thats going to cause some problems
3924242 youve got 100 000 people with the powers of superman
3924243 but they werent raised the way he was they dont have human values they dont know whats important to us and its going to get messy
3924244 the main objection of the council to the border wall is u s homeland security secretary michael chertoffs position that in order to build the wall they dont have to comply with any environmental laws and regulations
3924245 i think the fence is going to be built whether we try to stop it or not
3924246 i think the council as a whole finds the idea of a border fence ineffective and offensive

3924260 one of the concerns is that we havent been able to see enough of the implementation of the security forces
3924261 one of the concerns of the task force is that we havent been able to see enough of lets say the implementation of the security forces
3924262 we need to speak to the players and governing bodies and see if they are in the same position too if they want to see some more
3924263 i am coming at the iccs request to give my personal experiences to the new zealand and australian players and officials
3924264 i will be telling them why i live in lahore and why i think it is safe
3924265 i wouldnt be living there if i didnt think it was safe i will be letting them know my straightforward and earnest views
3924266 we strongly advise you to reconsider your need to travel to pakistan at this time due to the very high threat of terrorist attack sectarian violence and the unpredictable security situation
3924267 if you do decide to travel to pakistan you should exercise extreme caution
3924268 i get inspired in america by a certain kind of sleaziness
3924269 we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking im sure you feel this i see the change in you and youll find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would
3924270 oh i wish id remembered to have or do x while i was in labor
3924271 if the guy is asking for the value of that position you would think you would have to pay him at that position
3924272 but im not in those departments i would just like to have all of our players in camp
3924273 hes slotted i have a hard time understanding what is the problem
3924274 to me basically its how bad a guy wants to be in camp to take the high end of the slot or the low end or meet in the middle
3924275 but i think the last two or three years thats kind of changed now you see teams like nevada which was what top 10 in the nation in rushing in 2007 i played against nevada and i have more respect for their offensive line and their running backs
3924276 its more smash mouth now theres more prolific running backs in the league than there are prolific quarterbacks coming back its definitely changed
3924277 its one of the myths and its been a great marketing tool for the wac the wide open league we have but people dont realize how physical this league is you look at the teams that have won the most consistently the last four or five years theyre physical even hawaii thats not a finesse football team they look finesse but theyre physical

3924280 the number of votes split into small parties is like throwing votes into the trash
3924281 the formula gives the remaining seats to the big parties
3924282 i think the untac formula was better because we are talking plural democracy
3924283 if we had united the formula would benefit us as well
3924284 the human rights party demanded unification before the election and so did the norodom ranariddh party except the sam rainsy party if the sam rainsy party had had the same will i think it would have become true
3924285 i think they wont beat the cpp for two or three elections to come the cpps political agenda is too close to the people

3924297 de pronto el grupo de gente que hab amos conocido como personas de bien y civilizadas empez a comportarse como una manada salvaje en cada intervenci n cada uno iba sumando grados a la caldeada atm sfera en una especie de cabildo abierto se estaba decidiendo la vida de una persona y se hac a imposible bajar los decibeles cualquier llamado a la cordura parec a absurdo y era silenciado de inmediato por la muchedumbre en sus ojos no asomaba rastro de civilizaci n quer an sangre solamente sangre tiempo atr s ya hab an rechazado un m nimo control externo en su mbito ya noe exist a ni polic a ni gobernador la nica autoridad que exist a era de una colectividad que parec a organizada en contra del mundo su relaci n con los de afuera estaba hilvanada por el odio en alg n momento alguien sugiri entregar al condenado a la justricia no les convenc a la idea de ejercerla con sus propias manos o quiz s un atisbo de compasi n se asomaba pero fueron acallados y tambi n violentados o est s con l o con nosotros hazle entender algo a esa manada de fireras en aquel territorio la justicia y el estado de derecho hab a desaparecido

3924318 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3924319 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore

3924337 i said from the beginning of the year that we just wanted to keep riding and keep going in the way that we have been
3924338 youve got to keep it going in the right direction and not let one particular week get to you you have to keep the mountains and valleys as close as possible
3924339 were just out here to race our race and concentrate on making our car the fastest at the beginning of the weekend and then go out there and try to race with the rest of these guys
3924340 we know the 48 of jimmie johnson is strong but it took him a little longer than normal to get going this year

3924348 our car was extremely loose about all day so were going to change some stuff in the rear end and probably change up some spring split in the rear and go with a different shock combination
3924349 those three things right there will be the ones well key on when we go back we were really happy with our car there other than just being really loose and it didnt really get going until too late
3924350 halfway through a run the car would get pretty good but we need to get a little bit better on the short run it was like 20 laps before our car would ever come around hopefully weve got it tightened up enough to where we can go on the short run and see what happens on the long run

3924363 kansas speedway currently has an economic impact of 243 million annually to the area
3924364 the addition of a second sprint cup race would add another 111 million to the community

3924370 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3924371 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3924372 i kind of hide here in the united states because the men who raped me have made threats
3924373 instead this has provoked aggressions by some in the society and especially some police
3924374 it would be a terrible shame to close this door to asylum
3924375 they have sexual encounters in clandestine areas and in parts of the city that are just horrible and dangerous
3924376 later they go home and have unprotected sex with their wives many gays feel they have to have a wife for appearances

3924381 i was going to live in tijuana and just drive across for my treatment but i realized if something terrible happened and i went to the hospital there they wouldnt be able to care for me

3924384 i will wear a name tag will be sitting in the back room just ask hostess
3924385 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
3924386 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3924387 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3924388 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3924389 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3924390 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3924391 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3924392 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3924393 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3924394 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

3924400 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3924401 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3924402 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3924403 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy
3924404 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3924405 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3924406 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3924407 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3924408 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3924409 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3924410 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3924411 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3924412 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3924413 ich hab da zwei fragen warum h ngt er an einem fleischerhaken und wo zum teufel ist sein bein

3924416 watching mcdormand navigate miss pettigrews transformation is the kind of thing that can keep your hope in movies and in actors alive
3924417 i have this childlike rebellion against those who say that i cant do something which is something that i felt very early in my life i have more wisdom now than i did at the time but when most of the world tells you that you cannot do something what an incentive to prove them wrong
3924418 nyman has one foot in the 1600s and the other in contemporary times

3924422 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
3924423 one of the steps that has long been required has been the establishment of a proper embassy for syria and lebanon and vice versa
3924424 pretty soon a handful of like minded alumni who shared this passion came together to launch the camp
3924425 it gives us immense satisfaction to see the solace and relief on the faces of these needy patients it makes us happy to put into practice what weve learnt at college and we feel a sense of redemption for the free education we got it is a great way to spend a sunday
3924426 these camps save bread winners this in turn saves the families from poverty this is the larger ramification of our camps and india needs many more such initiatives
3924427 over two lakh patients have been treated at these camps over the last 12 years we were delighted to watch tears of agony change into tears of joy it has inspired us to do more
3924428 at the end of the day we hope more groups take the lead and start such camps there are millions out there who need it
3924429 the idea behind pstn connect is to provide users with a flexibility they dont have today for example the viper universal secure phone will appeal to those whose installations currently use the pstn network but who plan to migrate to voice over ip users who currently have voice over ip networks and others who plan to stay with traditional pstn

3924447 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
3924448 democratia ne a distrus a fost prost inteleasa si acum nu mai este nimic am avut formatie de dans cenaclu cor taraf oamenii acum nu mai sint interesati goana dupa bani le rapeste mult timp
3924449 o sa il concesionam in continuare pentru ca nu avem timp sa ne ocupam de el
3924450 anul trecut am fost ultima data cind a venit circul
3924451 de 10 ani de cind sint aici a fost adus de vreo doua ori cite un film discoteca si biblioteca s au mutat
3924452 avem un proiect dorim sa demolam actuala cladire si sa construim una noua functionala
3924453 au mai avut loc serbari cu scoala obiceiuri de iarna si lansari de carte
3924454 omul este cel care sfinteste locul si exista oameni care mai pastreaza traditiile de exemplu in satul sticlaria comuna scobinti sint ansambluri de dans popular fluierasi mesteri populari acolo este cea mai bogata activitate culturala din judet ansamblurile au mers in toata europa si au promovat cultura noastra populara si totusi acolo nu este un camin cultural iar ansamblurile repeta intr o sala de clasa
3924455 pircovaci miroslovesti sau tatarusi sint comune in care au loc activitati culturale notabile in general ansambluri folclorice
3924456 directia pentru cultura nu are potrivit legii nici o atributie cu privire la asezamintele culturale acestea insa prin intermediul primariilor pot fi reabilitate prin proiecte depuse direct la ministerul culturii si cultelor care are tocmai un astfel de program de revitalizare a acestor imobile
3924457 caminele culturale vor deveni adevarate centre care vor imbina componenta de spectacol cu cea de informare publica de asemenea vor gazdui biblioteca si muzeul satesc practic principalul atribut trebuie sa fie pastrarea si evidentierea particularitatilor locale
3924458 noi dorim sa facem ceva mai mult de un camin cultural o adevarata casa de cultura care sa cuprinda o sala de spectacole un amfiteatru biblioteca o sala de lectura precum si o gradina de vara in curte proiectul este estimat la 1 3 milioane de euro in cazul in care proiectul nu va fi aprobat de ministerul culturii dorim sa aplicam pentru fonduri europene
3924459 nimeni nu spune sa nu se organizeze in caminele culturale nunti sau ospete funebre pentru ca si acestea fac parte din ritualurile traditionale insa sa nu se rezume la atit activitatea caminelor
3924460 when hah is here klopfer really zips hah marks the patients on his leg and if klopfer sees that hahs got a legful he goes like wildfire to catch up
3924461 am fost acolo si am vazut care este situatia nu putem grabi anumite etape dupa ce torni betonul nu se poate lucra timp de 28 de zile dupa care se iau probe si se fac verificari lucrarile merg mai bine acum in zona arcu bacinschi mai complicate sint pe pasaj dar se lucreaza si acolo
3924462 am discutat si la berd si in principiu sint de acord ni s a cerut o motivatie in acest sens
3924463 e un tip de sudura mai deosebit nu se foloseste sudura electrica ci aluminotermica sint doar citeva firme care executa astfel de lucrari
3924464 timpul va fi recuperat am discutat si va fi suplimentat numarul de echipe
3924465 depindem si de conditiile meteo daca nu ploua putem avansa mai repede in plus trebuie respectati si o serie de parametri tehnici
3924466 acum merge mai incet pentru ca sintem la inceput daca in prima zi au fost in jur de 50 de cumparatori apoi am avut si cite 30 40 la cozi si la producatori am avut 15 in prima zi 30 in a doua apoi 20 speram sa vina mai multi acum
3924467 noi vrem sa atragem cit mai multi producatori mici am discutat cu primarii mai ales cei din zona metropolitana sper sa vina mai multi producatori de acum inainte oamenii pot gasi ardei ceapa varza pastai sint multe tipuri de cozonaci placinte cu fructe cu brinza a venit cineva de la costuleni cu sarmale aceste specialitati se gasesc in tatarasi
3924468 adinc influentat de muzica din frankfurt de la inceputul anilor 90 interactiunea lui chris wood cu muzica electronica s a dezvoltat rapid din pasiune in profesie
3924469 nous avons t mal conseill s au d part la personne avec qui nous faisions affaire nous faisait miroiter que le joueur de hockey martin brodeur souhaitait investir dans notre projet alors quil nen tait rien

3924471 s au luat aproximativ 225 de probe de apa si se vor mai lua si in perioada urmatoare bacteriologic au iesit destul de bune insa ramine vesnica problema cu nitritii deci e de preferat sa nu fie folosita aceasta apa in alimentatie sistemele centralizate de la iasi pascani tirgu frumos au fost verificate si probele de apa au iesit corespunzatoare
3924472 aceasta situatie arata nivelul scazut de dezvoltare al zonei este foarte greu ca o persoana muncitoare sa tina o alta persoana care oricum primeste intr un fel sau altul sprijin financiar de la stat situatia este specifica la nivelul intregii regiuni de nord est ceea ce trebuie sa facem este sa ne indreptam atentia catre fondurile structurale pentru a face ca acest decalaj sa fie diminuat
3924473 cei pensionati cu limita de virsta primesc o pensie din contributiile angajatilor si angajatorilor la bugetul de asigurari sociale de stat cei cu pensie de cap si veteranii dispun de legi speciale iar pensiile lor sint achitate de la bugetul de stat in medie lunar un angajat plateste catre asigurarile sociale o contributie de 9 5 iar angajatorul de 19 5 pentru angajatul respectiv in total lunar catre pensiile iesenilor se duc 29 din fondul de salarii lunar fondul mediu de pensii fiind de 74 milioane de lei pentru cei de la bugetul asigurarilor sociale si 19 06 milioane de lei pentru pensionarii legilor speciale
3924474 cea mai mare prostie sa scoti un om activ la pensie
3924475 contribuabilii sint din ce in ce mai putini si presiunea asupra lor este din ce in ce mai mare guvernul a anuntat ca va mari pensiile si daca asa va fi atunci nu numai ca vor intra mai adinc in buzunarele oamenilor dar vor fi luati bani destinati pentru alte secvente bugetare nu avem drumuri nu avem sosea de centura aeroport si spitale bune pentru ca nu sint bani s au aminat o gramada de activitati in infrastructura judetului ba ca nu i proiect ba ca i democratie de fapt nu sint bani
3924476 avem mult mai multi salariati dar ei nu figureaza nicaieri pentru ca lucreaza la negru ar trebui revazut pachetul legislativ si sa se impuna o lege prin care sa se impoziteze orice forma de venit indiferent pe ce cale vine
3924477 asta este problema guvernului care de anul viitor ar trebui reglementata ar trebui sa plateasca taxe si impozite aici pentru ca in fond noi le sustinem copiii lor prin invatamint si sanatate pe linga asta daca au probleme cu sanatatea si mai ales cu dantura vin in tara pentru ca acolo sint niste preturi colosale aceasta situatie trebuie reglementata la nivel central
3924478 a fost cea mai mare prostie sa scoti un om activ apt de munca la pensie nu au facut decit sa i scoata din circuit si sa le dea salarii compensatorii iar in ceea ce priveste raportul angajat pensionar este o problema la nivel national nu numai la noi la nivel central se fac echilibrari in timp probabil ca proportia se va schimba
3924479 la recursul etapei am vazut ca nici una dintre fazele litigioase ale meciului cu steaua nu a fost judecata in favoarea noastra sint tare curios ce va fi la bistrita
3924480 am spus o si o repet nu vreau sa fim prostii nimanui in trecut am fost dezavantajati la bistrita nu mai vorbesc de primele trei etape sint tare curios ce va fi acum mai ales ca se intilnesc doi antrenori care cer corectitudine sa vedem care din noi va avea piedici
3924481 echipa are un tonus ascendent in aceasta saptamina sper ca faptul ca am lucrat mult tactic in aceasta saptamina sa se simta
3924482 decizia sprijinirii galeriei o vom lua de la meci la meci la bistrita nu ii vom ajuta pentru ca nu am uitat amenda primita in urma comportarii lor de anul trecut de la buzau amenda pe care inca nu au platit o asa cum au promis cit si faptul ca am jucat cu portile inchise cu vasluiul tot din cauza lor
3924483 am citit pe niste site uri ca unii anonimi l au facut blatist si m am gindit atunci ca toti timpitii au dreptul de a spune ceva in cei trei ani in care a stat la poli radu a ajutat enorm echipa dind dovada ca este un caracter mare si va rog sa scrieti cu litere mari asta a facut multe la nivelul vestiarului si in plus nu mi a cerut niciodata vreo explicatie atunci cind era rezerva sau nu era inclus in lot altul la virsta si la experienta lui sigur ar fi strimbat din nas
3924484 ministerul a alocat in acest an fondurile in functie de necesarul real din scoli noi nu avem probleme am primit fonduri cit sa ne descurcam sa acoperim intreaga cerere in principal solicitari multe au fost la manualele de la limbi straine de asemenea toti copiii de clasa intii vor primi carti scolare noi noute
3924485 in urma actiunii de control s au gasit in spatiul destinat depozitarii oualor pregatite pentru comercializare o cantitate de 2 420 bucati de oua de prepelita cu termen de valabilitate expirat in plus spatiul destinat depozitarii produsului oua nu are un termometru de verificare a temperaturii in incapere
3924486 la prima sedinta a camerei deputatilor va lua cuvintul in plen si va anunta ca demisioneaza din parlament astfel incit procedurile impotriva domniei sale sa poata sa fie urmate sigur la momentul respectiv e dreptul domniei sale sa ia aceasta decizie pe care eu o consider o decizie eleganta in conditiile in care plenul camerei s a opus urmaririi penale
3924487 astea sint lucruri care clarifica situatia sa spui ca vrei sa incetezi monitorizarea romaniei iar in acelasi timp sa faci lucruri care contravin pe fata recomandarilor comisiei europene este o ipocrizie inseamna ca partidele care au votat asa si deputatii si au pus eticheta clar de fapt de ce parte sint ei
3924488 atrag atentia ca nu serveste la nimic votul uninominal atita timp cit se voteaza secret la voturile la toate voturile importante si cu miza din parlament daca erau barbati astazi afisau o lista cu ce au votat fiecare pe site ul camerei este o mare iprocizie toata chestia cu votul uninominal pentru ca de fapt nu se stie ce a votat fiecare

3924493 the obama campaign is going to have to decide if they are going to go after this who is going to do it and to what extent they are going to do that because they have to be careful not to blow it up
3924494 obamas campaign has to absolutely make sure they can respond to every charge and make sure they have all the research on this because the lack of this research was an enormous impediment to responding to the ads and the swift boat book
3924495 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
3924496 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3924497 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney

3924501 eu cred cu tarie ca trebuie luata o masura drastica pentru a determina acest agent economic sa intre in legalitate in relatia cu consumatorii ma gindesc ca ar putea fi aplicate de mai multe ori la rind citeva amenzi foarte mari de ordinul a 25 000 lei asa cum a fost ultima sanctiune sau sa determinam operatorul sa introduca clauze noi in contracte adica ar trebui ca pentru fiecare zi de intirziere la instalarea unui serviciu agentul economic sa plateasca penalizari clientilor
3924502 numai astazi n r ieri au fost exprimate 27 de pareri pro rcs amp rds si 13 contra motivele de sustinere invocate sint preturile avantajoase in comparatie cu ceilalti operatori din piata iar ca dezavantaje termenele prelungite de instalare a serviciilor contractate

3924506 gunoiul menajer depozitat necontrolat reprezinta una dintre probleme dar ceea ce este de asemenea deranjant se refera la parcajul de masini pe spatii verzi in oras stiu ca oamenii nu au locuri special amenajate pentru autoturisme din acest motiv s au dat amenzi de numai 500 lei de persoana
3924507 this really shows how phony the mental health exception is for these late term abortions this couple was relieved to be able to keep their baby and would have suffered mentally and emotionally from the loss of their daughter
3924508 there is no way that abortion would have met the legal standard of substantial and irreversible impairment to the mothers mental health if this pregnancy continued this is evidence that tiller and his cohorts continue to manufacture bogus mental health excuses in order to keep profiting from expensive late term abortions that are clearly illegal

3924511 timp de 5 zile ne am disputat sansele confruntindu ne cu judete foarte bine pregatite si cu traditie in activitatea de navomodelism cum ar fi braila constanta pucioasa dimbovita sau bucuresti buna pregatire dar mai ales tenacitatea acestor copii minunati si faptul ca am avut navomodele bine reglate si dirijate cu multa indeminare a facilitat rezultatele obtinute

3924539 when you get to talk to these people if im at an event and i watch someone win a gold medal im in the stands and i dont get to really experience it

3924569 they were all from rangers fans and in each case the reason given was that the cuellar transfer had been the last straw for them and that theyd had enough of paying money to watch the current team
3924570 assuming nobody else asks for a refund it leaves us three tables down at the moment but after our opening win over dundee united im hoping we can sell those tickets to accies fans this just shows though that we need a successful old firm because when celtic or rangers are poor it has an impact on all the other clubs
3924571 our corporate packages are sold out for that game but 99 per cent of our clients are aberdeen supporters
3924572 we havent had any cancellations yet but we have plenty of tickets left
3924573 we have a tendency to concede goals and not doing so will be the priority in this game
3924574 if you offered me a goalless draw i would take it right now because it would put us in a very good position for the return leg
3924575 weve had a lot of people saying to us just enjoy the fact that you have got this far but thats not how i see it were not just representing queen of the south or dumfries were representatives of scotland in europe and wouldnt it be good to prove everybody wrong
3924576 the gaffer has been over to denmark twice and hes been as thorough as ever
3924577 were quite a positive side and we go out to win every game we play we will definitely go out to win this one people say to us that well have to raise our game but we had to do that last season to reach the level we gained in the scottish cup and we have to take that experience and use it now
3924578 i know we lost at dunfermline but that was the best we have played in the first hour anyway
3924579 the first half was probably the best football we have played since i came to the club however we cant afford to lose two soft goals like we did in that game
3924580 we have the characteristics of the scottish game but we must ally that with patience even if the crowd are encouraging us and want us to push on
3924581 there was more of an air of concentration which is what we need

3924588 this is the first time we have run the course on thursday evenings and gives people who have previously not been able to go on wednesdays a chance to attend
3924589 people have always had a healthy concern about who might have written the essay
3924590 but there has been increasing concern as more and more students are applying in a highly competitive environment the essay is one area over which people feel they have control in a tight competition they want to do everything possible to give themselves that edge
3924591 sometimes the people with the very best credentials decide that they need to fabricate something people who want to be at the top theres no earthly reason for it
3924592 you cant say that the students the universities say no to are being denied because theyre not capable of doing the work so i suspect that applicants begin to view admissions as arbitrary and capricious and thats when they begin to think of gaming the process
3924593 it speaks to an erosion of trust the fault is not entirely the students or the parents if you had confidence in the assessment process then you would trust those decisions even when they say no to you
3924594 essays are taken to be particularly meaningful which explains the extent to which the essay has been elevated in the minds of applicants and their families almost into a redemptive device
3924595 its more recently that we see professionals enter the picture who actually advertise that they can help you write a winning essay
3924596 like everything else in america it runs the gamut from people who charge tens of thousands of dollars to 9 95 on the web
3924597 im certain some parents are writing essays im certain students can go on the web and find someone to do this kind of thing
3924598 a polished essay thats constructed beautifully with rhyming couplets at the end which might alert you to the possibility that it was not entirely the students own work
3924599 we just groaned because we knew we were going to see this essay in various forms from all over the world and we did
3924600 some people just plagiarised it some changed a few words
3924601 in those cases sometimes mother goes under the bus as in i had a bunch of essays on my hard drive and my mother sent in the wrong one
3924602 weve got to the point where it has become impossible for students and their families to understand why one person gets in and another doesnt
3924603 it would be tragic if parents were to intentionally or unintentionally lead their children down a slippery slope that could affect the validity of their work its a rite of passage to apply to college one of those points when people have to decide how theyre going to present themselves and whether they present themselves with integrity
3924604 we put some fifteen or sixteen to the sword and almost all the rest to flight my lieutenant bringing with him the queen and her children and one indian prisoner for the which i taxed him because he had spared them i caused the indians head to be cut off my soldiers did begin to murmur because the queen and her children were spared it was agreed upon to put the children to death the which was effected by throwing them overboard and shooting out their brains in the water captain davis he did take the queen with two soldiers ashore and in the woods put her to the sword

3924613 there is still a huge cultural barrier for some people we find quite often that librarians and e learning staff are very open to this but when you go within the humanities and you look at traditional areas such as english there is a real resistance to technology
3924614 i think there is probably a gap of knowledge anecdotally it seems that many young people are able to handle multiple information streams from a variety of sources
3924615 were moving into an arena in which human beings are able to handle a number of digital or electronic data sources all at once this is a new kind of human being
3924616 were in the transitional stage here within the academic community we have people who are at varying levels of capability and preparedness to move in that direction students expect their institutions to be engaging with them electronically but theyre still being communicated with largely through a4 sheets of paper
3924617 it does lead to a rethinking of the balance between the value of the face to face work and the ability to do a lot of other things effectively and taking the advantages as appropriate students can now go on to a social network and create something for their work a study group perhaps
3924618 students i think will do this and the key question is for staff to help to make it more effective in terms of the quality and dissemination of material
3924619 students lack those critical skills they have got used to getting huge amounts of material in this way but not very critically
3924620 the pedagogical distance between students and staff is an important one
3924621 there are a lot of conferences going on but they tend to be largely attended by the already initiated and the converted things are moving technologically more quickly than were acknowledging in our reflective conversations across the sector
3924622 the e learning people work really hard to get lecturers to come along to sessions about blogs and wikis but nevertheless it always seems to be the same faces it seems to be very difficult to break that barrier and get through to the next level of people its a question of getting people to follow that lead
3924623 lecturers who maybe dont understand the web very well will probably be very stressed about recognising plagiarism students are also very stressed about wanting to use the web as a resource but are worried about being accused of breaking rules
3924624 i expect there is a feeling that those academics with a presence on the web are seen as populists
3924625 thats compounded with the argot that they have developed from text language which tends to slip into their written work
3924626 none of the research groups that i have participated in
3924627 has ever really diverted from the use of what we could call normative english
3924628 it has struck me recently that there is almost an evolutionary advantage to people who know how to communicate well
3924629 i dont think were going to see a great move towards the use of the medium as a form of instruction in higher education
3924630 students still want face to face contact they value that they say that new technology is perhaps not to do with learning although they do spend two or three hours a day on the web they dont necessarily see the connection between teaching and learning in that particular way
3924631 its not just about using the tools its about using the tools effectively weve got to bridge the gap between informal learning using digital technology and formal learning in the institution
3924632 its something of considerable interest to the university in terms of how we might have to adapt our pedagogy going forward and the greater diversity of means by which students will wish to engage with learning
3924633 were trying to anticipate the kinds of challenges that may be pushed upon us as an institution
3924634 while i was on the walkabout in second life i bumped into another avatar online persona and it was one of my lecturers he was surprised to discover his vice chancellor there
3924635 we engaged in a conversation but i think he realised my avatar was being directed by a student colleague when he asked me a question apparently i responded by saying cool
3924636 it allows us to communicate much more quickly and effectively with students
3924637 we can send applicants information and update them on whats going on in the university from the moment they apply so that they feel part of the university at a very early stage
3924638 the system allows us to track where an application is at any time and we have target times to work to everything we do is underpinned by good customer care skills and transparency and everyone no matter when they apply is treated exactly the same
3924639 institutions are to varying degrees and in varying subjects increasingly in competition with one another so they are quite legitimately looking for approaches to recruitment and admissions that might give them a competitive advantage in some way
3924640 with centralisation the role has been taken from the academic admissions tutor to some extent albeit not completely
3924641 it is not that the academics dont have the final say the criteria are drawn up by the academics with the administrators and those criteria are applied centrally if there are any queries they are always referred back to the academic staff that is increasingly common
3924642 we had about 24 000 applications this year for about 3 500 places we found the key issue was one of consistency how do we make sure that someone who applies late is treated the same way as someone who applies early
3924643 it was resisted by some at first for the obvious understandable reason that we were taking decisions out of the hands of academics but then of course it was pointed out that thats how the american system works and it doesnt seem to harm the top american universities
3924644 academic staff are under pressure on all sorts of other sides delivery of research delivery of teaching so there is a very legitimate question about the best use of the time and resource that your academic staff represent
3924645 it is important to get a quick response because some of the research has shown that if a student is undecided they will accept the first offer that is made
3924646 academics are setting the standards if they feel the quality of students one year is not as good then that is reviewed on an annual basis and they can decide to make the entry requirements more difficult
3924647 in the past i think too many academics saw admissions as being just an admin task and didnt respect the fact that we are professionals in the area now their confidence has grown and we are considered to be the experts it works very well as a partnership
3924648 for a long time and i still detect it sometimes to my dismay there has been a view oh well admissions its just common sense isnt it it has in the past been a matter for the most junior or sometimes least research active members of academic staff to deal with there hasnt always been any real element of training for those kinds of staff but all of these things are disappearing now
3924649 professionalisation is certainly underpinned by training the admissions process even in the past four years is becoming increasingly complex the amount of legislation universities have to abide by checks through the criminal records bureau disability legislation age legislation child protection legislation it is no longer a job that can be done by one person necessarily because it is so complicated and time consuming
3924650 i think the very existence of a professional certificate or diploma is a recognition that there is a professional body of knowledge here a body of good practice that can be learnt and practised
3924651 perhaps it begins to answer the point often made about university administrative and management functions generally which is that there can sometimes be a lack of professional recognition for the very high level of activities being carried out
3924652 the traditional model does provide some challenges because it means that youve got a very large number of people that you need to keep professionally updated and there is obviously a greater risk of inconsistencies across the institution
3924653 there is an awful lot of resource dedicated to it each application we reckon is given four to five person hours worth of consideration
3924654 the other clear experience we have is that particularly with the levels of achievement in the public examinations system now and at least for the sort of selections we are doing you cannot simply do it on paper the only people who are really in a position to judge the academic ability of individual applicants are experts in their subject
3924655 the last thing any college wants is to be on the front page of a newspaper because of something going wrong in the admissions process some colleges have been there in the past and the memories linger
3924656 it is clear to every informed commentator that university admissions procedures are only one part of a whole series of decisions that can lead an individual to their final university place yet media discussion about fair access is usually dominated by the admissions process and it can be a pretty poisonous debate
3924657 the public debate continues and while there is no evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with most admissions ultimately the debate is corrosive of public confidence the answer lies surely as it so often does in openness transparency and accountability
3924658 in the context of the current public debate about admissions to higher education institutions want to make sure that they are doing the job as well as they can and not just doing it as well as they can but being seen to do it as well as they can
3924659 they see it affects a huge number of people at the same time higher education institutions are very keen to protect their autonomy
3924660 there are still people wondering whether the system is fair i dont think well ever eliminate those doubts but i think we must do more it is becoming more and more important for institutions to be transparent and explicit about their admissions processes
3924661 both as a catalyst to action and as a practical guide to fair admissions
3924662 our main aim is to support the sector in doing what it does even better than it does it already
3924663 that will involve not just identifying good practice but highlighting where things arent perhaps as good as they should be the whole point is about raising the game
3924664 in some areas we thought we were doing very well but in others we were lagging behind best practice
3924665 we hadnt codified our admissions practices in the way i think we now have to wed relied on a rather informal approach
3924666 weve got university wide policies and practices but they are delivered at a local level within our academic departments academics retain an absolutely key role in actually making decisions about admissions
3924667 in durham we are recruiting very capable students and we need to make sure that our academic staff are fully engaged in the process of identifying those people who are going to benefit from an undergraduate experience at durham rather than handing that process over to administrative colleagues who would have a very standard set of criteria but that is never going to be the whole picture it is not simply a tick box approach to thinking about how one admits students
3924668 i know that in other universities there has been a much stronger feeling that centralisation is the best way forward that it allows academic colleagues to step aside from the time commitment and all that is involved in the admissions process
3924669 i also wonder if this reflects something about the size of durham it is still a relatively small university although very popular in other institutions issues of size and scale may no longer make it feasible
3924670 the increase in numbers of applicants has certainly made it more difficult to treat applications on an individual basis academic admissions tutors are also confronted by a growing number of foreign qualifications some of them quite obscure from that perspective it makes sense to give professional administrators more of a role and allow them to take over some of the burden
3924671 it looks to me as if there are probably more benefits moving towards a centralised system but it has to be something that suits the institution
3924672 if they can demonstrate that whichever mechanism they are using they are using it fairly transparently and underpinned by good practice and an audit trail within their institution thats fine
3924673 with a greater drive towards professionalising the whole process writing it down making it transparent and explicit i hope we are starting to go a long way towards busting some of the myths that have been around for years regarding university admissions

3924738 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3924739 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3924740 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3924741 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3924742 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
3924743 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
3924744 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
3924745 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
3924746 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
3924747 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
3924748 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
3924749 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
3924750 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
3924751 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
3924752 it is such a surreal feeling to look behind the bus and see semi trucks with my name on them
3924753 even as this thing grows our fans are the same young kids that have always come out to the club shows they come to forget about school or work or whatever and have a good time so thats what we are going to give them
3924754 all in a lovely crisp glass flask this fragrance really wasnt my cup of tea and i would not pay the price of 80 for 100ml or the 120 for 200ml it is made from natural ingredients and is free of artificial colorings
3924755 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
3924756 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
3924757 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
3924758 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3924759 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3924760 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
3924761 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
3924762 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
3924763 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3924764 id love to if i can find the right movie
3924765 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3924766 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3924767 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
3924768 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
3924769 my initial thoughts when i got an email out of the blue from mike telling me he wants to switch codes was is this a joke am i being had
3924770 but after talking to mike on the phone i quickly realised he was serious and after what tadhg has achieved and with brendan coming along i know anything is possible
3924771 he knows its an experiment and we are prepared to take the risk because he is such a good athlete
3924772 the question is can he change to a different code hes never played and can he adapt to the skills
3924773 one thing that stood out was his marking when we bombed the ball up hes got some work to do on his handballing but his kicking is adequate hes just got to adjust his technique
3924774 in canada everyone knows what aussie rules is but they dont know much about it
3924775 they know it involves kicking and catching but everyone thinks its just one big punch up when you are younger everyone tells you there are no rules in aussie rules and thats what makes it so good
3924776 im happy with the progress im making in the back of my mind i have a goal of towards the end of next season to be in the same situation some of the rookies are now and making their senior debuts
3924777 were always looking for a challenge and something hard to do
3924778 you have to train hard and play hard in hard games so you definitely look forward to breaking that hoodoo
3924779 weve spoken a bit about the history of that it doesnt mean we cant beat them we can if we want to if weve got more desire and determination than them hopefully we can come away with the win
3924780 every team wants to move it with speed ideally its just whos going to do it the most and most consistently
3924781 theyve got blokes like lovett who love taking blokes on and have speed but so have we weve got andrew mcleod and david mackay who are lightning quick
3924782 we want to play two way football defensively and attacking so were going to work hard in defence slowing them down and then when we get the ball were going to move it with speed
3924783 i expect him to return but im not the coach so well see what happens
3924784 i hope he plays hes been training really well and hes looking fit i think hes just looking forward to playing footy again he really enjoyed playing in the sanfl its been a bit of a frustrating year for him with injuries
3924785 if i can put my excuse hat on which i can now because i am not coaching it was unbelievably critical
3924786 we had 19 inside 50s to four in the first quarter and we kicked four goals to their four goals and all their goals came after the ground invasion
3924787 i am sure port were happy with it because we were unbelievable we were playing as good a level of footy as we had played
3924788 i didnt know at the time that he did i found out after it which is probably a good thing
3924789 i dont know the big deal no one is allowed to do it any other time of the game they are charged and escorted out of the ground its pretty simple get into the 21st century and make it mandatory that no one is allowed on the ground at any point in time
3924790 its all about the forum that is created by the afl come out strong and say is is unacceptable this stuff about it being a great part of the game i put it in the same category as bouncing the ball who gives a stuff
3924791 i spoke to the club executive at the time to see what added security we could impose with the afl but i am not certain we got a lot of extra follow up from them
3924792 to me this decision has been made four years too late especially considering it was in a final and of such importance
3924793 i thought it was a massive call based on what i had done and on such a small period of footy
3924794 while i wasnt happy with the way i was going i thought it the story was going a bit far considering ive always been fairly consistent
3924795 everything was magnified by the way the team was playing everyones watching you like they are with kosi justin koschitzke at the moment
3924796 there were parts of my game which i saw on tape and thought gee that doesnt look good ive got to get better here
3924797 but they were things i knew i could work on not be career ending
3924798 i went into a different role playing up the ground as a roaming forward and just thought ill win my own ball
3924799 you cant rely on other people i just took things into my own hands playing up the ground present hard work back getting possessions earlier in games helps too
3924800 my confidence was low id been starved for opportunities in that lean time
3924801 at times you can feel worthless i was embarrassed with people coming up to me and saying what do you reckon it is do you think this or that people ask you all those things and you go insular
3924802 you go within yourself and then you play a good game and you feel comfortable again it makes it a better week not only for your ego but for your own self worth
3924803 id prefer people didnt call me wanting to help me but to be honest ive never had a longish sort of period of struggle and ive always felt the wheel is going to turn on ability and also on workrate
3924804 yeah he can be brutal its not all about kicking goals its all about the little things thats what he cares about
3924805 i was fine im not one for holding grudges or thinking im too precious like how can you talk to me like that
3924806 i saw it myself while i thought i wasnt getting anything on a platter or that the midfield wasnt doing me any favours im not one that ever hides away from what i might be doing wrong
3924807 he sat me down after the loss to hawthorn in round 11 and said just feel like weve got to start developing other players and i feel it would be best for the side that you have more of an impact for us up the ground
3924808 i did have a bit of angst because ive found the role sometimes hard previously
3924809 theres no doubt he was disappointed with some of my efforts and it was highlighted during the week
3924810 that was probably when i knew there were some areas that if i could fix those up it would turn around we played west coast the following friday and its been pretty consistent ever since
3924811 i feel like ive played pretty solid footy now for a few months it was probably just three or four games that were really poor
3924812 im contracted for next year and i say that from next year on it will all depend if im happy with how im playing because im not scared of retiring if im not performing at the level i hope that in three years time im still loving it and performing like hirdy was at 33
3924813 through those eight weeks i felt like i grew im as comfortable now with being captain as ive ever been
3924814 i probably used to manufacture things a bit now i feel its just natural
3924815 through the week i put a lot into the team and game days im very much the best way i can lead is by performing to my best and playing well get the best of foxtel
3924816 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
3924817 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
3924818 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight
3924819 a lot of the time we make changes on perception
3924820 since we changed the market all the money has still been for melbourne
3924821 when we heard david wirrpanda and ashley hansen were also being put in cotton wool there was an about flip with the teams prices
3924822 melbourne now looks like starting the game a genuine favourite
3924823 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
3924824 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
3924825 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
3924826 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better
3924827 weve learned that this isnt always true and there are potential harms associated with high levels of many nutrients
3924828 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds santana said
3924829 all the other guys that have been nominated you can sort of sit back and say theres no way im going to win this inglis said
3924830 awakening russian national self awareness has to a large extent been unable to free itself of great power thinking and of imperial delusions it has taken over from the communists the fraudulent and contrived notion of soviet patriotism
3924831 it must be declared loudly that transcaucasia will be separated off unequivocally and irreversibly
3924832 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else
3924833 earache records september 29th in europe and november 11th in north america
3924834 we are still attempting to move forward and the discussions with the players associations and world umpires association have gone i think very well
3924835 when the commissioner has more to say about it hell have more to say about it its still under discussion
3924836 you must be the change you want to see in the world
3924837 why do you say you feel trapped in a mans body
3924838 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3924839 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3924840 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3924841 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3924842 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3924843 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3924844 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3924845 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3924846 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3924847 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3924848 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3924849 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3924850 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3924851 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3924852 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3924853 our relations with the alliance cannot but change after jaap de hoop scheffer the nato chief did not say a word about the victims of the attack
3924854 shoot for the moon even if you miss you will be among the stars and remember t j loves you
3924855 malaysiakini said it would reveal the identities of the commenters if it could however the cops raided and seized all their computers the only reason that may help in this case is to obtain correspondence between the commenter and rpk for example e mails as evidence for further investigation if not then the only thing rpk can give them is the internet protocol addresses and times which these addresses were logged onto his site the police can then cross reference this with the service provider for example tmnet to find out exactly which computer was logged on
3924856 this is akin to an invasion of privacy the complainant should point out specific comments for the court to decide if they are objectionable or would aid in an investigation
3924857 in any case reading an allegedly illegal article is not an offence
3924858 our lawyer recommended that the comment be removed but that the ip and time of comment be withheld unless they obtained a court order the company said it would do so but eventually we did not hear further
3924859 i hope all the unselected candidates will give full support and work together in mobilising the partys machinery to ensure bns victory during the campaign dont push aside the selected candidate although in our division we are not supporting him
3924860 we have to strive to achieve success and we should not entertain other considerations and we should not think who will become umno division chief and so on instead think of the strategy to win this by election
3924861 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3924862 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3924863 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
3924864 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
3924865 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3924866 hes one that can hold that kick longer than anybody else especially in that last turn
3924867 everybodys popping up to the surface and hes still underwater taking that dolphin kick thats his most dangerous weapon
3924868 we were asked to understand how fish swim so efficiently
3924869 and it seemed like a natural extension to apply this to human swimming
3924870 essentially compare these swimmers to the dolphin assuming that the dolphin is the ultimate swimmer
3924871 and the thing that we found is that michael phelps is able to use his body in a way that is very very different from the other athletes and also seems to be much closer to dolphins than we have seen for any other swimmer
3924872 it seemed pretty obvious to me that kicking underwater seemed to be a lot faster than swimming on the surface
3924873 i probably would have been a good backstroker but not a great one it was something that really kind of changed the way backstroke was swum
3924874 almost 90 percent of all the thrust is coming from the foot
3924875 and the flatter bigger your foot is essentially the bigger paddle you have and thats one of the reasons the fish always beat us because they have extremely large flukes michaels foot size im sure plays a big role in his ability to swim very well
3924876 the best swimmers in the world cant go that far
3924877 they do the dolphin kick but they cant go far because theyve got to take a breath and michaels lungs are so powerful that hes been able to use that as his final weapon off that last turn
3924878 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
3924879 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
3924880 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records
3924881 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
3924882 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
3924883 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
3924884 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
3924885 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
3924886 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
3924887 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
3924888 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
3924889 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
3924890 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
3924891 the numerous whales maintained a very productive ecosystem as environmental gardeners it collapsed with their decimation
3924892 immigration to the united states significantly increases world wide co2 emissions because it transfers population from lower polluting parts of the world to the united states which is a higher polluting country
3924893 little more than a thinly veiled attempt try to advance an anti immigration agenda
3924894 we have the resources to make the payment we are availingourselves of a contractual right to a 30 day grace period
3924895 weve been talking to bondholders about a recapitalizationof the company
3924896 discard is a terrible practice in addition to the moral aspects of this sheer waste of food discards lead to unrecorded catches which lead to incorrect fisheries statistics which again disrupt the basis for scientific assessments of stocks and scientific advice on management
3924897 the best scientific advice is that we shouldnt be fishing for cod at all because stocks have been so depleted in the north sea and yet here we have tons of fish being dumped overboard
3924898 discard is happening all the time but normally it takes place at sea where nobody can see what is happening this incident has to be multiplied many many times to get an idea of the scale of the waste
3924899 the fishermen would say it happens because quotas are too small and they have to throw fish back but you would have to be insane to agree with that argument
3924900 it is morally wrong and its just p ing in your own bed this has been illegal in norway since the eighties and the boat would have been arrested had it done it in the norwegian sector it is just calculated environmental criminality the whole thing is very provocative disappointing and shocking
3924901 the system forces fishermen to go to a place they are unfamiliar with to seek the fish they have quotas for unfortunately in this case they landed a quantity of saithe which they didnt have a quota for
3924902 if they had dumped it there and then they would have been breaking norwegian laws and if they had landed it back in the uk they would have been fined
3924903 they did the only think they could do which was to steam 100 miles away wasting time and fuel to an area where they hoped to find the type of fish they are entitled to catch and where they could legally dump the saithe
3924904 this is a horrible indictment of the system fishermen have to operate under these are young men under massive pressures trying to make a living no fisherman wants to dump fish his job is to find fish for people to eat not to see it thrown over the side
3924905 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer
3924906 uk fishermen have shown that they are committed to finding new ways of protecting vulnerable stocks and the european union has backed a uk action plan designed to reduce the amount of discards
3924907 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3924908 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3924909 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3924910 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3924911 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3924912 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3924913 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3924914 the gulf stream works 365 days a year allowing electricity generated from its current to be available 24 7 compared with solar or wind resources plus there is a the possibility of using the thermal difference between the warm waters nearer the surface and the very cold water at the bottom which comes from the arctic circle
3924915 there are a number of sites around the world where extracting energy from the ocean current is potentially viable
3924916 about 20 percent of the gulf stream is entrained between the florida coast and the bahamas there the topography of the ocean shelf acts like a funnel guiding the current
3924917 we are taking a systems approach not just what is funded but looking at the bigger picture
3924918 research that needs to be pursued both in the power plant system but also in the environment and the ecology and the resource itself the gulf stream
3924919 we were absolutely astonished at the sheer scale of rubbish on such a remote spot
3924920 it is a graphic illustration of just how much marine litter is in the sea this stretch of coastline on the south west of the knoydart peninsula must be a prime catchment area for boat traffic in and around the minch
3924921 it is sickening to think that even the most far flung corners of this island are not free from litter and pollution
3924922 leaving the problem to coastal communities to clear up is not the answer we need to see far stricter management of the seas in the upcoming marine bill
3924923 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3924924 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3924925 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3924926 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3924927 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planningfor it more than 18 months ago
3924928 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profitmargins within our target range of 39 5 40 0 percent throughoutfiscal 2009 fiscal 2012
3924929 the management reiterates that its 2008 profit targets ofminimum 10 percent increase are realistic and well founded
3924930 today we face strong opposition and their weapon primarily is the press
3924931 its a temporary problem and ultimately the truth will prevail
3924932 we know that cellulose to ethanol works its a cost issue right now
3924933 i started last september and they only switched my phone lines on two weeks ago
3924934 everything has been a battle since everything has been a fight
3924935 we really must get up to 37 but with the hurdles of civil service the difficulty with getting people through the background checks and just finding qualified applicants the process has been much slower than expected
3924936 it provides an important set of capabilities and will accelerate our product applications enabling us to offer a broader portfolio of solutions to our customers and to enhance shareholder value
3924937 were not going to fold like a cheap suit like those guys up in north carolina
3924938 the problem isnt that were having to face difficult choices its that ralph hudgens and the republicans in atlanta failed to see those choices looming on the horizon
3924939 back when they were planning this budget they apparently didnt look around and see all of the warning signs in our economy but the average georgian did it doesnt take a degree in economics to know that with consumer confidence falling and our economy in the pits our tax revenues would drop off dramatically
3924940 to some extent the olympics are beginning to influence how people use new technology
3924941 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
3924942 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3924943 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3924944 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events
3924945 were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3924946 hes going to be great in this league all the best to him
3924947 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved you have to go out there and continue to work your way through it
3924948 i dont because when i look back on it there were a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out
3924949 over 500 contacts 500 people listed as friends and 90 percent
3924950 saw a series of video and social networking sites exhibit much more modest traffic growth than they had been
3924951 so you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone because the times they are a changin
3924952 this site has also been making the rounds it appears that the person behind the whole thing is a known hoaxer and the corpse is a simple bought costume not too sure about credibility but seems more reasonable than being the real deal

3925014 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
3925015 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
3925016 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
3925017 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
3925018 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
3925019 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly
3925020 they want to keep it running so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar
3925021 however these types of tools are overkill for most blogs my personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services
3925022 on saturday morning i do a check of my various blogs and on monday i do it again
3925023 on the internet a lot of traffic comes through google so you want to be sure you have a good record with them
3925024 before proceeding to study applications that may not make physical sense
3925025 one should differentiate between an isomer programme and what might be called the hafnium programme
3925026 the former has added significantly to the body of science as documented by many peer reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community
3925027 the hafnium program was focused to my knowledge on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and sceptical group it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping yet distinct programmes with quite different aims and outcomes
3925028 this approach differs dramatically from suggestions for use of isomeric materials in explosives applications
3925029 this process requires a resonance between the nuclear and atomic electron transition energies
3925030 in principle these might be adjusted within a high temperature plasma to bring an appropriate atomic transition into resonance with the nucleus
3925031 a secondary role of awe is to provide independent advice to the uk government on potential threats to the security of the uk so an understanding of the fundamentals of isomer physics is essential

3925038 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
3925039 the torching of houses in these georgian villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the scale of casualties that is then used to justify retribution
3925040 at the tskhinvali hospital 273 wounded people had been treated there during the conflict and a total of 44 dead people had been brought to the city morgue russian and south ossetian officials have claimed that 1 400 people were killed in the first day of fighting mostly in tskhinvali
3925041 by day five of a conflict one normally expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured or at least an indication of their age and gender but here there is no information absolutely nothing
3925042 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs

3925052 we have new lands from the icy but rather festive nordberg where minions face up to vicious seals to a new magic sanctuary domain where the magical creatures have retreated from the onslaught of the empire to the homelands and cities of the glorious empire itself
3925053 from the netherworld you rise to gather an army of loyal minions that are more destructive and much smarter than before now they can do even more things for their master such as riding mounts using war machines and sailing warships in world changing battles

3925057 ive got to think that dunns presence in the lineup will give them a lift people will make fun of how all the d back swings and misses will help cut the air conditioning bill at chase field but they cant deny that his on base skills and premium power will help he should take a lot of pressure off the younger hitters in the lineup who try to do too much at times i e mark reynolds and chris young
3925058 ive seen him for years and thought he would be a better player
3925059 his problem might be more on defense leaving the small left field of cincinnati for a bigger one in arizona and all of the nl west parks are big he wants to play every day and i think overall it should be a good trade for both teams the reds couldnt offer arbitration and the diamondbacks get some big time left handed hitting power i think he will do pretty well with the bat and once september comes around and you have extra players it will be easy to substitute defense for him late
3925060 blessed is he who is not offended in his union with me or in relationship to me

3925066 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
3925067 fourteen years later i went up again to jerusalem this time with barnabas
3925068 you are a jew yet you live like a gentile and not like a jew
3925069 we who are jews by birth and not gentile sinners know that a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in jesus christ
3925070 if while we seek to be justified in christ it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners does that mean that christ promotes sin absolutely not if i rebuild what i destroyed i prove that i am a lawbreaker for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for god i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness could be gained through the law christ died for nothing
3925071 any christian who sets himself up as a teacher in the church of christ and publicly teaches anything thereby opens himself up for criticism by others cf james 3 1 if they think what he is teaching is harmful to the church they have an obligation to point it out just as widely as it was taught such public warning or debate on the topic should not be considered a personal attack at all the teachers plea that a critic should first have come to him about his disagreement on the basis of matthew 18 15 does not hold this passage has to do with personal wrongs known only between the two who should privately discuss the matter that separates them what a critic of a public teaching does in pointing out his disagreement with that teaching has nothing to do with personal affronts or lack of reconciliation he is simply disagreeing at the same public level as that on which the teaching was given in the first place
3925072 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

3925082 yang paling penting pimpinan kita bertemu pimpinan umno dengan mandat dan keputusan syura mereka pergi bukan untuk berunding kerusi jawatan menteri tetapi untuk beritahu pimpinan umno supaya terima islam sebagai penyelesaian masalah ummat malaysia benar umno sedang lemah dan mereka mengajak kita dalam keadaan mereka lemah jika mereka kuat mereka tidak mengajak kita
3925083 kita berpegang pada konsep tahalluf as siyasi dan di atas konsep inilah kita berkerjasama dengan pkr dan dap
3925084 siapakah madu kita yang paling hampir dengan kita kalau bukan ahli pkr dap malah umno sekalipun benarkah ahli pkr dan dap bukan madu yang perlu kita dakwahkan lagi kerana mereka sudah menjadi rakan sekutu kita
3925085 barangkali sekutu politik ya tapi bukan benar benar memahami kita bukan sekutu yang memahami islam sefaham kita bukankah dap terang terang menentang hasrat pas untuk melaksanakan islam dari dulu sampai sekarang tak padam padam tapi dap masih sekutu politik pas
3925086 nisbahnya jika sedemikian maka bermuzakarah dengan siapa sahaja perlu dilihat dalam rangka dakwah yang lebih luas
3925087 go to the nearest wal mart line up 100 people and ask them whether they can relate to a man who owns eight houses and whose wife is a gazillionaire or if they can relate to a man who represents the american melting pot a man who just recently paid off his student loans a man who was raised by a single mother a man who is shock horror
3925088 the only way hes not is if somehow weve been transported into an episode of leave it to beaver or if by america the republicans and the barbecue media mean to suggest kentucky even with that as a qualification half of senator obamas racial composition is rooted in rural kansas his parents were divorced he barely knew his biological father
3925089 to paraphrase william f buckley i would rather live in a society governed by those first 100 people in wal mart than in one governed by the harvard faculty
3925090 although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term managing director robert elstone said
3925091 staggering pace but initial listing activity reduced sharply amid tighter credit conditions
3925092 the performance of asx during the difficult market conditions of fy08 underlines the resilience and diversity of the groups business model mr elstone said
3925093 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3925094 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3925095 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3925096 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3925097 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3925098 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3925099 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3925100 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3925101 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3925102 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3925103 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3925104 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3925105 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3925106 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3925107 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3925108 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3925109 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said
3925110 theres no way she can fit that whole thing in

3925115 say goodbye to the myth that oil demand and gas demand will soar regardless of the price the evidence is more than clear that oil demand is on the wane demand destruction is the word of the day as the evidence of that destruction permeates all around us
3925116 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3925117 we had retail sales that were in line with expectations so not earth shattering but being in line with expectations is not good enough these days so that was a further threat to equities
3925118 the markets were due for a correction because of falling crude and falling commodities but these are not good enough to lift markets because prices are still above levels seen last year
3925119 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3925120 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3925121 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3925122 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3925123 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3925124 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3925125 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3925126 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3925127 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3925128 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3925129 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3925130 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3925131 imagine watching a 3d movie now imagine watching it at home on our immersive eyewear that makes you feel like part of the action thats unforgettable

3925133 stereoscopic 3d video and virtual reality environments now coexist at home in one single application running on off the shelf computers and with a simple download at 3d power has been unleashed to the public and possibilities are now infinite theres no limit to imagination
3925134 law enforcement can use breathalyzers to determine whether a person is above the legal limit for alcohol use and saliva is used to detect the presence of marijuana or thc in a persons system but that test isnt reliable
3925135 we look to deliver a proven process that will vastly improve on the present day test for marijuana
3925136 it is frustrating that one agency of the u s government continues to wage a war against industrial hemp claiming that its the same as marijuana and yet at the same time they are doing research demonstrating how it does not contain significant levels of thc and therefore noting that military personnel cant reasonably claim that hemp foods cause a failed drug test
3925137 on disabling 3g service improved immediately there were no more dropped calls audio quality was fine battery life was much better
3925138 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3925139 there has been significant snowfalls with strong winds and widespread avalanche activity is expected on all aspects and elevations
3925140 in older people falls loss of memory confusion and shaking limbs may be written off as signs of old age when in fact they can be linked to a drinking problem
3925141 that rises to one in two when they reach 80 and the sad fact is that these falls often lead to a loss of independence or even death
3925142 easy to read information like this will help older people and families concerned about their alcohol use they will feel less alone and more able to ask for support
3925143 if similar situations arise in future where someone with a similar sort of background to dr tomeu and similar issues comes before council again then clearly whats happened here informs the decisions we make in future
3925144 youve got to add this additional information in your future decision making youve got to learn from this and you do learn from this
3925145 there are some specialities that are more at risk than others and o and g obstetrics and gynaecology is one of those
3925146 we knew they laid their eggs among bank vegetation in the tidal areas of streams but its much more specific than that
3925147 whats important is what is happening underneath the vegetation the inanga new zealands most common whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity
3925148 its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3925149 by and large it is probably smaller streams that are more vital for the health of the population as their spawning habitat tends to be more intact

3925157 this is another key patent in our broad patent portfolio that furthers our commitment at spectrascience to develop better more reliable cancer screening technologies the patent is important to the companys optical biopsy technology because in screening for some forms of cancer the optical response of the tissue is captured in a sequence of images that are characterized by analyzing the time dependent response of the tissue as recorded in the sequence during this type of screening the tissue may move while images are being taken resulting in a spatial shift within the image frame field being able to correct for this shift increases the effectiveness of the optical biopsy procedure tissue movement can be caused by the natural movement of the patient during the procedure which can occur despite a patients attempts to remain completely still this patent provides for an accurate analysis of the sequence of images which would otherwise be misaligned due to movement of the tissue hitchin added accurate imaging is critical to earlier and more effective identification of abnormal pre cancerous and or cancerous tissue and this invention provides methods of determining a correction for a misalignment in the imaging process that will make our screening devices more powerful to the physician and more important to the patient

3925166 this workaround has a number of very serious side effects that could threaten production environments any vms that sync time with an esx host and serve time sensitive applications will be broken these include but are not limited to database servers mail servers and domain administration systems
3925167 its pretty bad all around i would hate to be in an environment with super strict change management right now
3925168 all of my hosts are in a production drs distributed resource scheduler cluster and thus all of the hosts are populated with some number of guests i am going to have to down at least one full hosts worth of guests to apply this patch i would guess that this is the situation most esx admins will face
3925169 it took vmware up until 1 p m on tuesday aug 12 to post an official statement on the issue and they still have not reached out to their customers
3925170 they said they expect to have the issue resolved within 36 hours that is unacceptable to users
3925171 we had to quickly change the date to aug 10 get the vms running again and work as fast as we could to change the time to aug 12 again once the vms are running it works fine its when we shut down that is the issue
3925172 i wont move the update into production unless they prove it is solid if they fix it i wont move it into production for 90 days
3925173 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young

3925180 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3925181 if this is true whoever is responsible should be banned from foreign policy for the rest of his or her natural life mr saakashvilli may also have banked on support from his closest ally us president george w bush whose administration is said to have given tacit support for a georgian assault on south ossetia in the believe that the territory could be recaptured within 48 hours
3925182 i am not saying its all our fault but we should not create expectations we are not prepared to meet
3925183 the us has no rational basis to be as committed to georgia as russia is and has very little moral standing to protest an invasion of a sovereign country
3925184 what the bush people were thinking when georgias young western educated president to apply for nato membership send 2 000 of his troops to iraq as a full fledged u s ally and receive tactical training and weapons from our military
3925185 fred kaplan of slate is a bit trigger happy when it comes to blaming president bush for every wrongdoing around the world bush also knows that russia isnt iraq putin is no saddam and georgia is a sovereign country and not a rebellious group within a country
3925186 i am very very depressed at the pusillanimous reaction to russian aggression in what used to be called the free world blaming the georgians for not doing a better job of appeasing moscow is akin to blaming the czechs for not doing a better job of appeasing berlin over the sudeten germans
3925187 that what america did in going to war with iraq is the moral equivalent of what russia has done to georgia
3925188 im chastened now im sorry to say but this administration has done it to me
3925189 the point here is not that the invasions are obviously morally equivalent the point is that the line between american actions in the world and russias are no longer as stark as they once were once you trash the international system declare yourself above the law and even the most basic of international conventions against war crimes you have forfeited the kind of moral authority that the us once had
3925190 call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers
3925191 the reaction of certain left wing pundits to russias invasion of georgia would be amusing if it werent so pathetic instead of exercising their rhetorical skills to denounce this flagrant violation of international law they are instead fulminating that some might dare to compare russian aggression to the past aggression of germany or the soviet union
3925192 as noah pollak demonstrated giraldi is a crack pot anti semite
3925193 extremists on the left and right quickly promoted giraldis smear but the prize for sheer idiocy in this saga goes to andrew sullivan
3925194 after all the dark and sinister picture of the bush administration doesnt quite seem to fit with a procedure in which a suspected terrorist has counsel introduces exculpatory evidence and beats the rap on some charges not much of a gulag is it
3925195 hamdan didnt just drive bin laden he also guarded the master terrorist
3925196 unfortunately the judge has no idea whether hamdan will provide for his wife and daughters or will strap a bomb to one of them and send her to a crowded market
3925197 what does it tell you about the bush administrations detention and interrogation policies that they have managed to appall those who care about this countrys reputation for justice and madden those who want to see all al qaeda operatives even very low level functionaries like hamdan kept behind bars
3925198 on the other hand it would be foolish not to appreciate and to take sober satisfaction in the magnitude of this development
3925199 pete while i admit in the short term sadrs repurposing of the mahdi army is a clear indication of coalition success and malikis legitimacy the move has to be viewed with deep skepticism
3925200 i would certainly not now and not ever place my hopes on the good intentions of muqtada al sadr while we surely havent heard the last of al sadr whats happening in iraq and to the mahdi army is a remarkable and encouraging thing to behold
3925201 the world and the west can live after all with a deterred and contained nuclear iran israel cannot
3925202 israel is certainly threatened but so too are other direct american interests throughout the middle east and beyond
3925203 i dont see a future in which such a unipolar nuclear situation in the middle east is permanently feasible
3925204 the bottom line is that presidential candidates can talk grandly about global partnerships but its meaningless without a mechanism to wield authority a crucial question in an authority crisis is who has a strategy for execution
3925205 the real difficulty with multipolarity is not so much that there are more groups vetoing collective action as it is that many rising powers dont agree with washington or brussels what the real problems are
3925206 if president bush continues accommodationist policies brookss next column will not be on global sclerosis he will be writing about
3925207 this is the same kind of post modern political speak that characterizes obamas positions and those of democratic presidential candidates in the recent past on key issues of foreign policy and war and peace to obama in all likelihood off shore drilling is neither a good idea nor a bad idea its just a suddenly thorny political issue
3925208 obama has also led a one man crusade to keep the american people ignorant about whats at stake in the debate over off shore drilling
3925209 the most important thing to remember about obama there is never a bottom line on anything so with enough time and enough political pressure he is likely to shift gears on just about anything
3925210 one could dispute that theory but its not a particularly remarkable thing to say you have a candidate who was greeted enthusiastically in europe saying that the enthusiasm was about something larger than him about the united states and about the values barack obama and millions of other americans cherish and hope will once again govern the country
3925211 given the current back and forth on the ego and the examination of barack obamas enormous self regard the contrast between the two candidates is breathtaking
3925212 to the extent that mccain has used the awe inspiring symbolism of his own personal sacrifice and duty to country as a campaign theme relevant to being president contrary to what wesley clark says getting shot down over vietnam and being tortured for five years while certainly not a requirement for presidential office is a qualification
3925213 mccain not only refuses to recognize obamas symbolism he openly mocks it
3925214 the pentagon says no cameras or campaign entourage and he says fine and quietly visits with a senate aide
3925215 even though john mccain not only didnt support the recent webb gi bill and in fact couldnt even be bothered to venture to washington to cast a vote for or against it because he was in california raising money he loves the troops
3925216 weighed the potential value of a visit against the opportunity costs including rest time or time in the gym foregone and concluded that the trip wasnt worth it and given that the pentagon had recently informed the obama campaign that the press could not come along it seems plausible that this information factored into the candidates revised cost benefit analysis
3925217 i could go on and show that the surge is responsible for the invention of the calculus the birth of christ the extinction of the dodo and the hula hoop craze after all you can prove virtually anything once you adopt the humpty dumpty principle
3925218 were still going to have to leave iraq and its still the case just as it was before the war that iraq might muddle along okay or might turn into a disaster all depending on what choices iraqi leaders make
3925219 this specific timing issue aside we can see here the larger point that mccain doesnt actually seem to know what the surge was
3925220 if you show video of a question being asked you ought to cut to the interviewee answering that question not just show some other film
3925221 now the irony here is that the origins of this whole farce is mccains efforts to hog credit himself for the adoption of improved counterinsurgency tactics
3925222 there of course is the utter disconnect an avoidance of reality what senator would have occurred without the surge would it have been alright for the u s to be badly defeated al qaeda to achieve a victory genocide to have broken out and the leaders he met with yesterday to likely be slaughtered or forced into exile
3925223 as i see it malikis statement is all upside for obama it neither poses risks for him nor presents him with problems but its a minefield for mccain
3925224 whatever it is maliki would like to get from us forces the larger imperative is to get it in the context of also getting a plan to
3925225 basically this morning we saw maliki speaking in person and endorsing obamas plan to end the occupation in no uncertain terms by the late afternoon an iraqi government spokesman was pretending this never happened in a statement released by the occupying army
3925226 they had an on the record interview in which malikis remarks were not at all ambiguous and during which time he repeatedly returned to the subject of thinking that obamas proposals are the right framework within which to proceed
3925227 because endorses a timetable and keeps being forced by the bush administration to walk it back undermines the authenticity of his support for withdrawal back in realityville maliki keeps saying this because he wants us to set a timeline viewing this as the only politically feasible way forward
3925228 to be seen as pressing for the departure of u s troops
3925229 there is an important difference between setting an arbitrary deadline for ridding ourselves of iraq or vice versa regardless of conditions there and drawing down troops as everyone wants to do as it becomes possible to do so because we have won
3925230 the position that senator mccain whose campaign i advise has been pushing all along
3925231 its good to see an iraqi government spokesman explain that prime minister malikis comments to der spiegel in which he seemed to endorse barack obamas 16 month timetable for withdrawal from iraq were misunderstood mistranslated and not conveyed accurately
3925232 mccain didnt really mean that and instead his plan is to ask nato nicely to send more troops to iraq back in the real world the question of enhanced allied contributions is yet another reason to favor a withdrawal timeline from iraq
3925233 lets hope obama thinks more seriously about the impact of the outcome in iraq not just on afghanistan but on our interests throughout the middle east and the world at large
3925234 if immediate withdrawal was the best way to inspire iraqis to sort out their own bloody differences does that not hold for afghans
3925235 its remarkable how much convergence is happening right now most of it good news
3925236 but when one who supports an attack on iran cites such horrors theyre considered cold hearted hawks when a supposed realist like peters does so they think theyre giving the world a wake up call
3925237 mostly its supposed to solve something related to their nuclear program but nobody can ever quite say what
3925238 its really hard to say whether or not bombing iran would really delay anything at all
3925239 while i am sympathetic to the arguments for opening an interests section in tehran i am not convinced that now is the right moment
3925240 sending u s diplomats to tehran would be creating hostages to fortune
3925241 as a matter of common sense and decision making his new iraq policy is problematic
3925242 the advisory announcing the event clearly says limited workspace will be available on site there is no wireless internet available and yet there is wirless internet available if hell mislead america about wifi networks what else will he mislead us about
3925243 whats interesting to me is how the speech is about much more than iraq its about focusing on pakistan on energy independence and on iran its a speech that might have been given by the first president bush
3925244 the notion that most americans are incapable of seeing the satire strikes me as joke i think is supposed to be at the expense of the paranoid right but in the end all the wrong targets get slimed thats what happens with lazily conceived art
3925245 obama isnt a muslim and his wife doesnt carry an ak 47
3925246 obama doesnt want to deal with these very real issues
3925247 the problem with rapid response is precisely that it is rapid and therefore might be hasty and ill considered that is clearly the case with the obama camps amazingly dumb tantrum regarding the new yorker cover
3925248 but that obama would have allowed america to lose al qaeda and iran to win and the iraqi people to suffer mass death and possibly genocide because of his ideological opposition to the war is far worse on those grounds alone he ought to be disqualified from being americas next commander in chief
3925249 but it is worth remembering as pete somehow omits that the fundamental casus belli the wmd threat from saddam was false and we removed saddam over five years ago the war since is what we are discussing
3925250 i suppose im pessimistic that the actual point that a timeline for withdrawal is the right strategy for america will get heard over additional controversies over whether or not this constitutes a flip flop
3925251 with provincial elections coming up in the fall there is every incentive for maliki and other iraqi politicos to show they are not puppets of uncle sam
3925252 posts like boots today can only reinforce suspicions that the real motive for invading iraq was rather different not incidentally from that given at the time
3925253 if maliki is genuine mccains stance is wrong if maliki is politicking as mccain suggests mccains stance depends on how long maliki can keep the bullshit coming
3925254 in his last sentence andrew hints that there was some deep dark motive for invading iraq that wasnt stated at the time again i literally have no idea what he is talking about
3925255 i wont bother responding to your final juvenile taunt about just because we can
3925256 if the iraqis ask us to leave we have no business staying you write i agree my point was that the iraqis arent asking us to leave because unlike you and other anti war voices in the united states they realize that the consequences of a an overly hasty american pullout would be catastrophic
3925257 i do not think im being unreasonable or reckless in hoping that we can finally bring closure to this debacle after eight years at a cost of up to 3 trillion hundreds of thousands of innocent deaths if that is leaving immediately or a precipitous withdrawal then heaven knows what max boot thinks is empire
3925258 if public opinion to our presence is so hostile that iraqi political leaders feel compelled to set a timeline for the departure of the us military then we should set a timeline as theres no sense trying to wage counterinsurgency under those conditions
3925259 it is impossible to predict with perfect accuracy the real life results of any course of action a thousand unanticipated factors may cause idealistic plans to go horribly awry
3925260 the alternative is to try good faith negotiations it might not work but it really might and that would be much better than continuing this cycle
3925261 there is something profoundly dangerous about a candidate for president who refuses to engage with foreign powers as they are
3925262 cmon nouri make our day tell us when to leave
3925263 with iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki talking up the timetable option its worth considering that it has a solid logic from an iraqi point of view
3925264 at the very least i think obamas free ride from the press is over
3925265 the smart iraq strategy for mccain is the one he was using before the current
3925266 believe it or not mccain is a victim of his own success he supported the troop surge that turned iraq from a hopeless disaster into a critical triumph the same troop surge thats allowed americans to let iraq slip from their radar with the war no longer perceived as a pressing calamity what care american voters which candidate has the best iraq plan
3925267 the vets of course have never wavered on iraq that distinguishes them from barack obama who holds up a finger in the wind before he says anything about the issue
3925268 relieved that obama has shifted exactly as i hoped he would to a pragmatic commitment to a withdrawal strategy that does not jeopardize the fragile and reversible gains of the last year or so
3925269 if obamas thursday comments are consistent with his prior pronouncements are we then to assume he really isnt taking into account an entirely different set of facts on the ground and changing policy accordingly
3925270 i think that if obama becomes unpopular and loses the election itll be because a larger number of voters decide that having a tough foreign policy is the most important thing
3925271 having spent much of the year attacking obama as a commie atheist alien the neocons are now going to have to attack him as a more electable version of the clinton they came to love and praise in the primaries
3925272 the only question is why the washington post thinks its a good idea to publish columns that are designed to mislead its audience rather than to inform its audience
3925273 of course this all makes obamas 16 month withdrawal timetable more and more feasible
3925274 we are in far better shape than anyone could have imagined during those difficult days in early 2007 when most of the nation and the political class had given up on iraq
3925275 no one is saying that george w bush is the moral equivalent of khaled sheikh mohammed what we are saying is that torture is torture is torture that torture is always evil
3925276 how is it possible to know that everything john mccain once said on videotape for the enemy was false because it was coerced and yet assert that everything we torture out of terror suspects using exactly the same techniques is true
3925277 now we have confirmation that the us has adopted torture techniques used by the chinese communists
3925278 you will find no right of center blogs commenting its an astonishing story but they wont mention it i guess when a republican administration copies communists conservative writers need to copy stalinists
3925279 the people who committed this form of enhanced interrogation knew full well it was torture and they used that word its a good one and it means what it says
3925280 that the main purpose of these chinese torture techniques was to elicit false confessions
3925281 i dont think any particular conclusion can be drawn except that iran is a much
3925282 at a minimum there seem to be obvious implications for the ongoing iran debate
3925283 obama may be listening to the loony left which is encouraging him to resist apologizing for clarks mega gaffe
3925284 the implied contrast clark drew was with clark himself rather than with barack obama
3925285 letting clark go out on the morning shows with non apologies gave the unmistakable sign that obama isnt serious about halting this line of attack
3925286 this time it is rand beers no novice to government service or campaigns slamming mccain for missing out on key foreign policy training and knowledge because of his time as a pow first the comment is plain ignorant second once again a surrogate shows that the obama camp attracts the very worst of the left sneering disrespectful and ignorant of the value of military service
3925287 i think its time for wesley clark to be ushered quietly off the stage
3925288 on sunday mccains campaign issued a pair of outraged statements after retired general and barack obama supporter wesley clark said he didnt think that mccains service as a fighter pilot and prisoner of war was relevant to running the country
3925289 politico does acknowledge that most of the attacks on mccains war record are now coming from the left
3925290 the obama campaign through clark trying to raise questions about mccains military service
3925291 wesley clark is now and always has been a clinton type but this is pretty revolting this kind of personal attack was repulsive coming against kerry from the far right and its repulsive the other way round both kerry and mccain served their country honorably and their records should be revered period
3925292 strictly speaking it is irrelevant for the presidency if someone was shot down and tortured it doesnt make anyone a better potential president
3925293 the swift boat attacks in 2004 were way over the line but the pushback on
3925294 theres nothing to reject in clarks remarks he not only failed to say anything untrue he didnt even say anything controversial
3925295 one is left to conclude that the obama campaigns messaging and choice of representatives is atrocious
3925296 the question is whether the likely practical results of a mccain presidency a presidency that will be constrained by all kinds of factors foreign and domestic will so empower the boot vision of americas role in the world which i do not share as to make a vote for mccain a vote for boot
3925297 one thing i have learned these past few years is that there is no longer any moderating instinct within neoconservatism it has become an absolutist ideology which is why its cooptation of the word conservatism is so repellent give them an inch and theyll take a country
3925298 its true of course that electing john mccain doesnt in reality actually commit the united states to a 100 year effort at semi colonial control over iraq
3925299 liberal bloggers andrew sullivan and josh marshall are furiously attacking my comparison between iraq and germany
3925300 the broader point is that the success of american military interventions has usually been closely related to their length the longer we stay the more successful we are
3925301 but i get the sense that marshall and sullivan like many of their antiwar compatriots dont really care about whether we win or lose in iraq they simply want to get out and damn the consequences
3925302 some fearless journalist and i mean you andrew has got to get to the bottom of this international conspiracy to hijack u s foreign policy
3925303 we are left with oil a misguided belief that the wests occupation of the middle east will protect israel and well just because we can none of these arguments is persuasive to me when you factor in the enormous costs drain on the military and absurdism of iraqi political culture
3925304 the more honest among the surge opponents will concede that bush that supposed dolt actually got one right
3925305 we do not know what the long term implications of the last year will be
3925306 its also true that the security gains of the past year make a strategy of leaving iraq look a lot more viable than it looked a year ago
3925307 president bush was right in his decision to move ahead with the so called surge and we are seeing the fruits of that decision in the security economic and political arenas
3925308 jewish neoconservatives people like joe lieberman and the crowd over at
3925309 heads i win tails you lose nothing on the ground in iraq neither success or failure can change these pundits pre determined recommendations talk about a faith based policy
3925310 but boot a mccain advisor goes so far as to reinforce his candidates call for 100 years of neocolonial military presence in iraq
3925311 what can one say about jennifer rubin who accuses me of antisemitism
3925312 he helps us realize that this election is indeed at root a decision on whether to keep troops in iraq for the next century or more
3925313 its about an ever greater american entanglement in the middle east in part to secure oil supplies we need to wean ourselves off and in part a foolish attempt to protect israel and joe klein is in no way engaging in anti semitism please by pointing out the increasingly obvious fact that the iraq war was in part launched to assist israel
3925314 when the iraq war goes badly the critics talk about the lack of planning the lack of exit strategy and the general sense of hubris visited upon the endeavor but once things look brighter its straight back to the jews
3925315 please note that i am not endorsing the half baked conspiracy theories which hold that the u s went to iraq to grab its oil
3925316 you can dress it up any way you please or try to excuse it however you like but it is the
3925317 this is an aspect of the withdrawalist critique that i find particularly frustrating aha but you didnt turn baghdad into a harmonious multifaith enclave of cosmopolitan prosperity yet right
3925318 provided we dont abandon the iraqi state at its most vulnerable point
3925319 i think its extremely premature to start talking about iraq as if its fundamental problems have been solved just because we have had a breathing space in the conflict long enough to make both withdrawal and a permanent occupation more palatable
3925320 i could just imagine an andrew sullivan of the 1940s writing something similar about harry trumans crazy idea to station troops in germany and japan without an exit strategy
3925321 that islams deep revulsion against foreign rule as a religious outrage in a time of resurgent islamic fundamentalism can be equated with what was left of post yglesias agreed with his fellow
3925322 the problems with this strategy have nothing to do with analogies as long as were there our presence will always be a divisive destabilizing force
3925323 its sad to see articulate and intelligent if terribly misguided writers still trying to justify their iraq catastrophe by claiming its no different from world war ii and our decades long stationing of troops in germany and japan
3925324 for the record and once again iraq is not germany nor is it south korea iran is not nazi germany nor the soviet union the islamist radicals are a terrible danger as we learned on 9 11 but not an existential threat to the u s any attempt to compare the current situation with nazi germany as george w bush did recently in jerusalem or with post war germany as max boot is doing in commentary is comparing apples and helium balloons
3925325 not only did klein not back down but he expanded his outrageous accusations
3925326 the notion that only jews whose first concern is for the security of israel could possibly favor the invasion of iraq is laughable
3925327 i really think its mccain whos confused here if osama bin laden or anyone else were in the jurisdiction of a properly constituted international tribunal the u s judicial system obviously wouldnt have the authority to rule on his status one way or the other
3925328 as ive said before our american hawks think and act exactly like the irrational madmen they imagine to be running the show in teheran
3925329 if conservatives themselves are going to start pushing this storyline then they really need to stop complaining about liberal scaremongering
3925330 it reminds us that while mccains energy policies are much better than barack obamas obama wants the price of gasoline to remain high so that americans cant afford to drive their cars mccains policies are still an ill assorted jumble
3925331 what im curious about is why conservatives are so ga ga over the whole prize concept in the first place prizes for spaceflight prizes for batteries prizes for cancer cures prizes and more prizes
3925332 at the very least obama will need to figure out what short term solution is not too short and what long term solution is not too long for now his plan seems to consist mainly of excoriating his opponent
3925333 are human beings and capable of responding to traditional interrogation techniques
3925334 al qaeda terrorists still on the loose will be helped by reading articles such as this one full of operational details which provide a virtual playbook for avoiding arrest and resisting interrogation
3925335 it suggests the punditocracy is all too anxious to airbrush iraq and the surge out of the political dialogue
3925336 would send a powerful message at the outset of his administration
3925337 i wish i could dismiss this as grandstanding i fear it isnt
3925338 when bush says that abu ghraib was the work of a few he forgot to mention that he was one of them
3925339 key implementers and enablers of torture under the current president
3925340 my rage at bush has not caused me to accuse the man of war crimes bushs war crimes are what caused my rage
3925341 level with the american people and tell them exactly what system he favors and how that meshes with his celebration of the supreme courts expansion of rights for terror suspects
3925342 to make sure voters dont forget obama favors habeas corpus rights for osama bin laden
3925343 he seems like a noteworthy omission from any effort to gather the great and the good of democratic foreign policy not that ill miss him
3925344 its going to take more than a photo op with the likes of madeline albright a handful of retired military officers and seventeen flags to make obama into a credible leader on foreign policy
3925345 obama either didnt listen to or didnt understand what zebari said or misrepresented what he heard from the foreign minister that is deeply troubling
3925346 come around to the mccain surge position and is willing to tell zebari but not the voters
3925347 simultaneously get credit for standing up to bush on climate while also agreeing with bush about the particulars
3925348 mccain 1 has made it all but impossible for mccain 2 to run with this issue and go on the offensive with obama on a matter of central concern to the american people
3925349 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses

3925351 this is another key patent in our broad patent portfolio that furthers our commitment at spectrascience to develop better more reliable cancer screening technologies the patent is important to the companys optical biopsy technology because in screening for some forms of cancer the optical response of the tissue is captured in a sequence of images that are characterized by analyzing the time dependent response of the tissue as recorded in the sequence during this type of screening the tissue may move while images are being taken resulting in a spatial shift within the image frame field being able to correct for this shift increases the effectiveness of the optical biopsy procedure tissue movement can be caused by the natural movement of the patient during the procedure which can occur despite a patients attempts to remain completely still this patent provides for an accurate analysis of the sequence of images which would otherwise be misaligned due to movement of the tissue hitchin added accurate imaging is critical to earlier and more effective identification of abnormal pre cancerous and or cancerous tissue and this invention provides methods of determining a correction for a misalignment in the imaging process that will make our screening devices more powerful to the physician and more important to the patient

3925356 anwar bukan anak guaman biasa anwar tidak bertarung kerana kehilangan atau kerugian dalam perniagaan seperti kes kes lain tetapi beliau berjuang kerana hak asasi manusia hak rakyat malaysia
3925357 oleh itu bagi saya anwar merupakan anak guaman yang sama sekali berbeza daripada yang lain
3925358 saya sentiasa mengambil kes ini dengan serius beban mengurus dan mengendalikan kes ini sentiasa berat walaupun pernah mengendalikannya 10 tahun lalu
3925359 saya melakukan membela anwar sebab saya merasakan ia adalah sesuatu yang sepatutnya saya lakukan ini merupakan satu bentuk perjuangan yang perlu dihadapi sehingga ke akhir penyelesaian pasukan ini perlu akan melakukannya

3925366 here theres an exciting consumer product at the centrepiece of a marketing campaign but weve got legislation running counter to it
3925367 there needs to be some disclosure about the legality the emphasis has been on the fact that you can store and archive for a lengthy period of time the law is very clear it simply wont let you do that

3925371 the consumer marketplace is increasingly going beyond that apathy to a type of lawlessness theyll just ignore the government because its so irrelevant

3925476 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3925477 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3925478 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3925479 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3925480 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3925481 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3925482 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3925483 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3925484 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3925485 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3925486 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3925487 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3925488 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3925489 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum

3925575 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study
3925576 at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice i know how important it is doesnt mean i have to like it
3925577 theres no substitute for sundays and ive said that way back when
3925578 theres no way playing in an nfl football game and getting to do the things that ive been able to do you can replace that its impossible up until this point im willing to do whatever it takes to continue doing that
3925579 its harder i felt 38 today im not going to lie to you
3925580 ill never guarantee anything but ill play my butt off
3925581 it can be ugly or it can be good but ill play as hard as i can and thats the only thing i know how to do im excited about it not only for this week but in the future
3925582 you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that
3925583 now they havent thrown everything at me but i can go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3925584 look i heard youre not talking to the media i understand you dont want to say anything good about me thats ok
3925585 look im not here to take chads spot or replace him
3925586 i think hell realize if he doesnt already that im an easygoing guy and easy to work with
3925587 you drop a ball so what i throw bad passes were in this thing together and id like for us to come out of it together
3925588 quick deceptively powerful guys hard to tackle and good in and out of space
3925589 are those the type of guys that you want to drop back and throw deep into coverage probably not but i think these guys are definitely in space types of players
3925590 were blitzing off the left side and weve got to do this and weve got to do that
3925591 its one thing to line up in a stance and theres no one chasing you and just run around when you put the pads on and youre going against people thats when you really find out what guys can do
3925592 but theres very few times that you ever see him get run by so thats another element that you saw on tape 40 time versus playing speed was very different
3925593 he knows when the receiver enters into the end zone now you dont want to be even with the receiver you want to slide underneath him because you have the sideline and you have the back of the end zone as your help
3925594 he did a nice job transitioning sliding and then playing the ball that was a lot of the stuff that we saw in college the instincts
3925595 when you make plays especially as a young guy you just get more confidence from it
3925596 hes been a guy who has been around for a long time and he knows little tricks its almost a surreal feeling as a young guy going against him in practice its going to prepare you for the games

3925681 despite me being in the nfl i was also a fan of the cfl so i understand that theyre loyal to their teams its ok if theyre going to be out there in protest but its all for a love of the game if you guys love football then support it

3925717 psychological acupuncture can help over ride our emotional and physiological responses to different stimuli including food
3925718 it requires some focus and training but is an easy practical and painless way of managing body and mind issues
3925719 will power is the most common hurdle people face because the moment they think they not allowed to eat something they are deprived its like a little child they want to have it
3925720 we believe that people who are overweight or obese food cravings probably play a big role in why they have extra weight
3925721 if they dont want to eat that food through this technique and they are not interested in it anymore and that made a big part of their diet especially breads and pastries therefore over time they will lose weight
3925722 lap banding does not change any of the emotional feelings to do with eating

3925742 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury

3925756 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3925757 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3925758 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3925759 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3925760 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3925761 our challenge from day one has been to shape our roster in a way that our fans will see a team that is competitive that plays hard every night and has a chance to win
3925762 we feel this trade continues to move us toward that goal for this season and beyond
3925763 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
3925764 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
3925765 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3925766 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3925767 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3925768 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3925769 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3925770 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3925771 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3925772 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3925773 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3925774 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3925775 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
3925776 children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them

3925830 there is also no doubt that as a party we need to improve our organisational structure we have been in the position before where we had a well oiled machine that could win elections and by elections and we need to get that back we have lost a lot of activists we need to get more members
3925831 i believe that the scottish labour party does need a change of direction
3925832 we dont just need to listen to people but we need to adopt progressive and practical policies that make sense to them as well
3925833 people are saying to me that they want to see priorities made of good quality education and healthcare
3925834 i think we need to have more affordable childcare linked to more flexibility in the benefits system and i want to look at the not for profit model in public transport particularly in the scotrail franchise
3925835 we have to set out what we can deliver for ordinary scots and we have to set out what it is that can make a difference to their lives
3925836 i also think politicians need to be more accountable to people generally politics has become far too detached from ordinary people i think that is probably true of most politicians
3925837 the labour party has to come from the community upwards this is about re establishing that link and deciding what will make the most difference to the quality of life of scots
3925838 whoever is elected leader of the scottish labour party needs to recognise the important role of small businesses in safeguarding and regenerating our communities
3925839 small businesses provide the services jobs revenue and focal points which keep many of our communities urban and rural viable
3925840 but the practical effects of doubtless well intentioned legislation delays in the planning system and more are making it more and more difficult for us to continue doing so
3925841 we need to stay strong and true to our beliefs and values and not to try to copy the snp in their populist and ultimately disastrous policies
3925842 the snp can keep on doing what they are doing which is making all the easy choices short term easy hits which in the long term will have an adverse impact on the people of scotland what we should not do is follow them down that road we have to stick to what we genuinely believe that means long term investment in the health service in the things that are going to make a difference
3925843 i think what we need to do is have a change both in policy direction and in the organisational structure within the scottish labour party
3925844 i believe we must present to the people mainstream traditional policies which seek to eradicate poverty and promote social and economic justice
3925845 i think we need a revamped policy forum process which is as inclusive as possible of all sections of the labour party and the labour movement
3925846 the labour party has to do two different things both of which will be hard to achieve it has to appeal to its core electorate and it has to try to appeal to the electorate which it courted successfully in the early to mid 1990s the aspirational voters
3925847 its good that all three candidates for the leadership have said they will do something about the council tax they are starting to wake up to some of the policy changes they have to make this is difficult though because labour is still in power at westminster and taking a different policy approach will not be easy
3925848 the scottish labour party needs to be more new labour it shouldnt obsess itself with structures it needs to be more new labour in its policies
3925849 there should be more choice about public services the scottish labour party certainly needs to be aware of what has been achieved in england as far as waiting lists are concerned and a degree of choice
3925850 politically the bottom line is they mustnt obsess themselves with the constitution thats not what made new labour successful over the last ten years
3925851 there are two things that the party has to do if it is to win in 2011 even though it is not entirely in its own hands to win back power
3925852 first it has to reacquire a reputation for competence second it has to adopt a stance that instils within the party an ability to claim effectively that it is willing to stand up for scotlands interests as much as the snp
3925853 this is proving to be a crucial issue in the leadership election with iain gray seen as representing the westminster interests and andy kerr taking a more scottish approach
3925854 the scottish labour party must elect a leader who will be bold and ambitious to win again
3925855 clearly standing up for scotlands interests will be key to success coupled with the ideas and vision that chime with the aspirations of people across scotland
3925856 we need to listen learn and act to ensure that we are in tune with peoples ambitions
3925857 we need to speak to our natural supporters the people who have struggled to continue to support us in recent times and we need to listen to them to make sure they know they are being heard people doubt whether we still have a value set
3925858 people are talking about fuel price rises and the credit crunch they have got to get the message that these things matter to us
3925859 we have to speak about our value set because that is what people dont think we have got any more
3925860 we all put in a lot of effort in the by election at glasgow east and obviously we want to win again
3925861 to do that we need to change there is no doubt about that
3925862 we need to make sure there is room for discussion that does not just involve elected members talking to themselves but takes in all of scottish society young members right up to pensioners and people who have been there for generations that is crucial
3925863 also the leader role needs to be beefed up to give us more credibility against the nationalists
3925864 we need a strong leader of the party in scotland who will stand up for scotlands interests inside and outside the parliament who understands that elections are won on ideas and vision for the future
3925865 we need someone who understands the ambitions of scots and can articulate the distinctive policies that will see scots identify with labour again as their party the peoples party
3925866 the snp looks like a party that is fresh dynamic full of ideas and most importantly has a leader who appears to have a populist vision by contrast scottish labour has looked for the last year like a party bereft or even scared of radical ideas
3925867 it must use this period of opposition to come up with a raft of fresh policies that chime with the scottish public and demonstrate it is capable of making bold decisions independent of westminster vitally it must avoid playing the sort of negative yah boo politics we are all fed up with
3925868 labour needs to have an internal debate on what it stands for it needs to set aside the discipline that new labour brought
3925869 that discipline was good for what it did but it now needs to move on and be very clear what it believes in both on the constitution and on social and economic policy
3925870 we know what it doesnt stand for but we dont know what it does stand for it also has to come to terms with the new politics we have with the tories fairly certain to win the next westminster election and the snp a force in scotland
3925871 labour needs to reconnect with working people and their families
3925872 this means policies that address issues like low pay equality and protection at work people who are feeling the impact of the current market failures need to know labour can intervene to help them
3925873 the issue of local income tax is one of huge concern to working students at a time of greatly increased living costs students need far greater financial support and we would call on the labour party to back our campaign for a minimum income guarantee for students
3925874 the issues affecting students are all too often misunderstood by politicians the party which takes the time to understand these issues and really tackles student hardship will secure themselves votes not just today but in the years to come
3925875 i think we have to mobilise our membership to feel proud to make labours case again
3925876 to do that that case has to be about peoples day to day concerns and expressed in a language that makes sense to them
3925877 we have to be talking about cost of living issues but we also have to be talking about how we would ensure that there are wider opportunities
3925878 this should be done through skills and apprenticeships and education for peoples children so they can look forward to an improving quality of life
3925879 people dont believe labour seeks power for a purpose they think power is our purpose we have to go back and talk about the things we care about the agenda of social justice
3925880 we need to do more to convince people that this isnt just a battle inside the labour party but it is the reason we want power so we can take on the snp on its central deceit which is that it is a party of social justice we have to rebuild confidence that we have a reason to be in power that there are things we care about and that we want to do
3925881 to win the trust of business both the new scottish labour leader and the labour party will need to do what is right for growing the economy and to avoid doing things that will hold it back
3925882 there are many aspects to this but it should include continuing to invest in the transport infrastructure improving our education and skills particularly in the sciences and in basic skills of literacy and numeracy and improving the planning system so there is a greater presumption in favour of development that will grow the economy

3925893 persoalan aborsi remaja di indonesia itu jika dibandingkan dengan salah satu negara bagian saja di as sudah lebih gawat
3925894 di indonesia ada 2 5 juta aborsi di mana 1 5 juta di antaranya adalah aborsi yang dilakukan remaja kalau aborsi dilakukan oleh seorang istri ada alasannya seperti alasan kesehatan atau kegagalan program keluarga berencana
3925895 hampir semua remaja yang datang berkonsultasi menanyakan soal ml ini bisa menjadi salah satu pertanda bahwa semakin banyak remaja yang telah melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah
3925896 lebih repot lagi kalau yang bersangkutan sudah berusaha dengan berbagai cara minum ramuan atau ke dukun segala selain harus mempersiapkan dia menjadi ibu sekaligus bisa tetap sekolah kita juga mesti berhadapan dengan kemungkinan si bayi lahir cacat
3925897 saya sudah berkali kali memperingatkan wina agar tidak pacaran dengan riva karena dia sudah punya istri dan anak pula
3925898 kalau sudah berani begitu artinya dia sudah dewasa saya sudah berusaha memperingatkannya tetapi dia nekat memilih riva maka dia harus berani menghadapi kenyataan dan bertanggung jawab pada kehamilannya
3925899 biarpun sama sama hamil di luar nikah tetapi kondisi mereka berbeda beda makanya penanganannya pun harus individual ada keluarga yang mudah didamaikan artinya tidak perlu saling menyalahkan dan bertengkar lebih baik mencari jalan keluar tetapi ada juga yang sampai memerlukan bantuan konselor entah itu psikolog penasihat spiritual atau anggota keluarga lain yang disegani
3925900 kalau lingkungan begitu memojokkan dia tak jarang yang bersangkutan jadi trauma kepribadiannya berubah dia jadi menutup diri tidak mau bergaul ini kan kontra produktif
3925901 untuk menghadapi kasus hamil di luar nikah atau kehamilan yang tidak diharapkan ini konselor harus berkejaran dengan waktu usia kehamilan terus bertambah sementara kita perlu mempersiapkan yang bersangkutan keluarganya sekaligus mengorek keterangan apa saja yang telah dia lakukan begitu tahu dirinya hamil
3925902 tindakan seperti ini buat anak yang sudah dewasa mungkin dia bisa mengambil hikmahnya tetapi buat anak yang masih berpikiran remaja akan membuatnya tidak pernah belajar menjadi dewasa menjadi orang yang bertanggung jawab pada perbuatannya
3925903 kalau tanggung jawab itu diambil alih dia akan merasa jadi anak abg anak barugede terus menerus bahkan bisa jadi dia hamil lagi
3925904 bisa dikatakan setiap perempuan itu punya naluri sebagai ibu jika orangtua tidak mendorong si anak menumbuhkan nalurinya sebagai ibu maka anak itu tidak akan bisa menjadi ibu dari bayinya
3925905 pemerintah melarang aborsi tetapi tidak memberikan fasilitas bagi perempuan yang mengalami kehamilan tak dikehendaki padahal kondisi yang bersangkutan saat itu biasanya stres berat dia harus menanggung kehamilan sekaligus dibuang keluarga ke mana dia harus pergi situasi ini jadi sangat menyedihkan bagi sang ibu dan janin yang dikandungnya
3925906 apakah manusia mengira bahwa ia akan dibiarkan begitu saja tanpa pertanggungjawaban bukankah ia pada mulanya setetes nuthfah sperma yang ditumpahkan ke dalam rahim kemudian menjadi alaqah lalu allah menciptakannya dan menyempurnakannya lalu allah menciptakan sepasang laki laki dan perempuan
3925907 dan bahwasannya dialah yang menciptakan pasangan laki laki dan perempuan dari setitik nuthfah apabila dipancarkan
3925908 setiap orang di antaramu diciptakan dalam rahim ibunya dari setetes nuthfah selama empat puluh hari lalu dia menjadi alaqah selama kurun waktu yang sama kemudian menjadi mudhghah selama kurun waktu yang sama juga dan kemudian allah mengutus malaikat datang kepadanya dengan membawa empat perintah sang malaikat itu diperintahkan untuk menuliskan rezeki usia amal perbuatan dan akhirnya nasibnya bahagia atau sengsara lantas meniupkan ruh kepadanya
3925909 keberadaan manusia memiliki tahapan tahapan tahapan pertama adalah penempatan air mani dalam rahim dan campurannya dengan telur wanita kemudian siaplah ia menerima kehidupan mengusiknya adalah suatu kejahatan ketika ia berkembang lebih lanjut dan menjadi suatu gumpalan menggugurkannya adalah suatu kejahatan yang lebih besar
3925910 seorang wanita dari ghamid datang kepada rasulullah dan berkata wahai rasulullah aku telah berzina hukumlah aku tetapi rasulullah menolaknya esok harinya perempuan itu berkata wahai rasulullah mengapa engkau menolakku mungkin engkau menampikku seperti engkau menampik ma iz demi allah aku telah hamil nabi berkata baiklah jika kamu berkeras maka pergilah sampai anak itu lahir ketika wanita itu telah melahirkan dia datang bersama anaknya yang terbungkus kain buruk dan berkata inilah anak yang telah kulahirkan nabi berkata pergilah dan susuilah ia sampai engkau menyapihnya ketika wanita itu sudah menyapih anaknya dia kembali kepada nabi dengan membawa anaknya yang sedang memegang sepotong roti wanita itu berkata nabi allah inilah dia aku telah menyapihnya dan dia memakan makanan biasa sekarang nabi mempercayakan anak itu kepada salah seorang kaum muslim dan kemudian menetapkan hukuman bagi wanita itu
3925911 siapakah yang berhak atas nasib janin dalam kandungan sang ibukah yang harus tunduk kepada hak janin untuk lahir ataukah janin yang harus tunduk kepada ibu sebagai pemilik rahim yang mengandungnya

3925917 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3925918 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3925919 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3925920 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3925921 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3925922 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3925923 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3925924 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
3925925 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
3925926 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
3925927 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
3925928 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
3925929 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia

3925999 imagine a desert scene with a deep blue clouded sky camels are walking in the horizon while the wind blows in your hair
3926000 that made me feel so worthless i almost felt like crying
3926001 i went to a restaurant today and guess what i had
3926002 a state in which youre aware of your own emotions and sensations but decide on your course of action logically
3926003 they listened to the facts they listened to the law and they came back with a decision i cant say i disagree with it
3926004 my main reason to be here is for the people thats gonna come here after me its just been take away take away take away and i think its time we all take a stand and try to reverse this
3926005 you need guys to shut people down out there and thats what he does
3926006 and the best thing is hed be there first to say hes got room for improvement
3926007 we all have an ego but he keeps his ego in check he cares about the team hes a hard worker hes the first one in line for all of our drills he tries to do it exactly like you ask him to do it hes humble hes hardworking hes just just everything you would want
3926008 and its time to go make plays on the ball
3926009 he went out in his contract year and had an excellent year
3926010 and were fortunate to sign him to a long term deal here which hopefully means he ends his career here that is sort of the right thing you know hes a local kid played at wazzu to play your whole career in the state of washington is pretty unique
3926011 i feel established but yet at the same time im working hard ive got to get better
3926012 without kxci supporting local music greyhound soul would not be on the radio in tucson
3926013 kxci has supported greyhound soul since our first record freaks back in 96
3926014 first and foremost we love to play so its not like a big sacrifice
3926015 its always been a priority of mine to help out along those lines i wouldnt have gotten nearly the exposure ive gotten if it hadnt been for kxci its a jungle out there
3926016 were able to fund our needs and occasionally our wants
3926017 we think the best community radio is done by the community
3926018 our awards are based on the degree of risk people place themselves in in such situations mr bannister said
3926019 ms aquinos actions that morning were deemed to be of greater risk than the actions of the others who went to help
3926020 she screamed at the gunman to stop and he certainly looked back at her and identified her and she continued to harangue him until he turned and left the scene study hard
3926021 this incident is of great concern to the government of mexico
3926022 under no circumstances would it be justified to shoot lethal or non lethal objects to the mexican side of the border
3926023 this agent thought his life was in danger or that his fellow agents lives were in danger so he responded
3926024 state cant wield the sword and claim the shield too
3926025 the state has no sovereign immunity in this case lead paint public nuisance because it voluntarily initiated this suit as plaintiff
3926026 equally lacking in merit is the states argument that costs should be denied because defendants failed to exhaust the remedies available to them from the outset namely by making a conscious choice not to seek review of this courts denial of the motion to dismiss
3926027 the defendants did seek supreme court review of the motion to dismiss decision on june 7 2001 and that interlocutory review was denied october 26 2001 although there is no exhaustion requirement to entitle a party to costs the defendants meet even the states mythical list
3926028 with respect to the co examiner fees specifically the state over defendants repeated objections suggested and argued for the appointment of a master insisted on proceeding to incur that expense despite risk of supreme court reversal and repeatedly opposed defendants request for a stay suggesting to the court that defendants experienced no irreparable harm because the expenses of the proceeding could be recovered at the conclusion of the proceeding in the event of appellate reversal
3926029 the united states supreme court has recognized that it would be seriously unfair for the state to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts on one hand but at the same time claim immunity for the same court on an intertwined claim see lapides v board of regents 535 u s 613 619 2002 that state voluntarily came to this court and filed a suit against the defendants the court should place the costs of suit and co examiner expenses where they belong with the state
3926030 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3926031 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3926032 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3926033 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3926034 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3926035 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3926036 do you really think that any drunk could navigate these potholes as well as i am
3926037 its no use im going home and getting back in bed

3926243 the hoaxer stitch up of john humble and the corrupt policeman responsible

3926314 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3926315 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3926316 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3926317 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3926318 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3926321 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3926322 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3926323 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3926324 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3926326 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3926327 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3926328 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3926329 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3926330 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3926331 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3926332 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3926333 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3926334 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3926337 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3926338 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3926339 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3926340 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3926341 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3926342 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3926343 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap

3926505 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3926506 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3926507 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3926510 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3926511 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3926512 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3926513 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3926514 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3926515 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3926516 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3926517 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3926518 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3926519 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3926521 let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend
3926522 summer is when you normally start to see things slowing
3926523 the seasonality while it usually results in softening of baltic dry index rates in the summer typically reverses once we get into august
3926524 you have to believe that if youre going to be buying into the sector that the slowdown weve seen in commodity prices is temporary in nature and the second half of the year youll see a rebound in industrial activity especially in china post olympics
3926525 increasing demand for the movement of steam coal increased iron ore import demand the seasonal grain trade and a persistently tight supply of ships through the end of 2008 should put the bdi on an upward trend in the next 40 60 days and we see the trend lasting into december

3926527 then this will have proved to be a very good step
3926528 my father was a revolutionary so what can be better than the tree going for fidel
3926529 we dedicate it to fidel so that he draws from it great strength at his 82 years of age because cuba and the world need him
3926530 we are requesting something for the main leader of the revolution religion is not against praying for the commander because it was he who gave continuity to the war of independence
3926531 we have a practise according to which religious leaders must pray for the health of important people or personalities if they are ill until that person has fully recovered
3926532 now the ceiba will grow fast so that children can enjoy its shade
3926533 for all cubans he remains the commander his ideas are guiding us and we are satisfied that this ceiba will give him great health we hope he recovers soon
3926534 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3926535 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3926536 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3926537 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3926538 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3926539 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3926540 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3926541 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3926542 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3926543 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3926544 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3926545 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3926546 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3926547 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3926548 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3926549 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3926550 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3926552 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3926553 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3926554 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3926555 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3926556 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3926557 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3926558 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3926559 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3926564 besides the employees own personal information there are often product drawings and schematics these are highly confidential
3926565 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3926566 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3926567 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3926568 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3926569 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3926570 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3926571 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3926572 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3926573 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3926574 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3926575 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3926576 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3926577 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3926578 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3926579 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3926580 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3926581 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3926582 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3926583 the public health of new bedford residents is paramount we will continue to closely monitor the water quality at all city beaches and will notify the public of any significant changes

3926587 you have to be able to raise a considerable amount of money
3926588 when you see things like that you wonder whats gods purpose
3926589 ever since the plane crash my whole attitude has changed
3926590 mother nature has made all of our lives difficult and we cannot control the number or intensity of hurricanes that could make landfall this year or next year
3926591 im very pleased with commissioner mccartys work i think hell handle this case appropriately and i think you know what i mean by that rejecting it the increase
3926592 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3926593 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3926594 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3926595 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3926596 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3926597 i think the pull and the need for organs is so strong that it could easily encourage critical care physicians to consider the declaration of death potentially sooner than they normally would
3926598 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive
3926599 had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
3926600 we were ecstatic and we were relieved that we could help somebody else
3926601 i am from canada and my name is garbanzo bean
3926602 everything that you see a lot of the murals youll see inside all from the area
3926603 all the fish youll see in the aquarium the saltwater and the freshwater are fish form this area
3926604 so when we come in here well be immersed in our own outdoor surroundings
3926605 of course of course we want everybody to want to buy something we have the restaurant we have an arcade for the kids
3926606 youre saying when we come here well want to stay a while
3926607 right it will be an all day adventure it will be an adventure its like having an outdoor adventure on the inside
3926608 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
3926609 moscow may be expected to punish israel for its intervention
3926610 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
3926611 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3926612 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3926613 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3926614 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3926615 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
3926616 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
3926617 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3926618 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3926619 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3926620 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3926621 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3926622 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
3926623 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
3926624 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3926625 it does no harm just once in a while to acknowledge that the whole country isn
3926626 it costs about 4 cents per machine you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so youd be foolish not to
3926627 minden komoly kapcsolat mell legal bb egy szeret kell ez az let rendje
3926628 we want our residents and particularly our youngsters and families to have access to swimming time during the last week of vacation before school starts
3926629 she represents something fiercely current yet utterly timeless and her shine is a true rarity a female pop album as sophisticated as it is fresh
3926630 using new comic strips drawn in the style she used 29 years ago when the patterson family first appeared on comic pages johnston will begin retelling their story from the beginning
3926631 everything in september is new the punch lines the drawing all are new the only thing retro is the way im drawing everything i want it to flow into the classic material seamlessly
3926632 this first year the ratio of old to new will be at least 50 50 i want this to be the best thing ive ever done and im having so much fun drawing lizzie as a baby again and revisiting all the characters
3926633 for a generation of new readers unfamiliar with for better or for worse its a chance to begin an exciting journey for current fans its a chance to relive their favorite episodes one such episode is the adoption of farley the pattersons beloved dog that will come in october
3926634 at first i thought that i could segue back and forth from today to yesterday but that became very confusing
3926635 some people really enjoyed it and some just wanted us to get on with the story
3926636 im starting right at the very beginning when elizabeth was a little crawling baby and couldnt say too much and michael was in kindergarten
3926637 im a better storyteller now and i want to improve the storyline or take a piece of art and make it better
3926638 at this time in my life i thought i would be on a cruise ship to panama or the mediterranean
3926639 but im a single lady now and i want to keep working because i dont have to work 365 days of new material into a year i can still take some time off to paint and travel
3926640 when i first started the strip the comics style was fast and loose probably because i was so busy and i had to get it out fast
3926641 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
3926642 in the same way we delete marriages involving fourteen year olds a man with two wives just cannot exist by law
3926643 this traveling around its gonna be the death of me
3926644 ive had an excellent time so far theres only one thing that i fear ive been up so long on this lucky star it could be all downhill from here
3926645 for me all downhill is really about appreciating the moment
3926646 obviously its intended to be funny but it really is about being able to know when things are good and thats certainly the way i feel
3926647 theres nothing i value more than working with smart and talented people who do what they do because they love to do it because they just cant help it
3926648 in terms of a recording experience it was maybe the most pure fun that ive ever had in the studio
3926649 number one i had complete confidence in the material usually im working on my songs and full of anxiety and angst hoping the material is good enough to stand up to the level of musicianship
3926650 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten
3926651 on march 29 the first round of the presidential election which he won you voted for change you have been clear we will not betray you
3926652 a solution must thus put the people first not leadership positions and titles we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
3926653 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3926654 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3926655 morgan tsvangirai has requested time to reflect and consult three times he agreed to this one aspect and three times he changed his mind
3926656 on our side as a party we have no problems on that aspect
3926657 going with the mdc faction of mutambara will not create a scenario which the international community can buy into
3926658 thats a very thin veneer that everybody can see through
3926659 womens humour has played a significant role in scotlands cultural identity over the generations
3926660 scottish women who have faced challenging situations in their everyday lives have often survived poverty and oppression because of their humour
3926661 we have been at the vanguard of delivering new female comedy talent to eager audiences across the uk for six years
3926662 this is our opportunity to reward and promote talented women at the fringe
3926663 were determined to act on the ground many countries said were ready to join in
3926664 the eu will try to intervene theres a lot of political work to carry out but right now were focusing on stopping the war so that women no longer see their childrens throats cut
3926665 they probably need to be given new functions because it is extremely important to monitor the actions georgia takes
3926666 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3926667 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathisers
3926668 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors
3926669 we knew they laid their eggs among bank vegetation in the tidal areas of streams but its much more specific than that
3926670 whats important is what is happening underneath the vegetation the inanga new zealands most common whitebait spawn where grasses clump together and form a dense root mat where there is almost 100 percent humidity
3926671 its not uncommon for different generations of fish to choose the same clump of grass for egg laying
3926672 by and large it is probably smaller streams that are more vital for the health of the population as their spawning habitat tends to be more intact
3926673 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3926674 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3926675 when implementing an soa users are typically so busy worrying about how to move information that they tend to ignore whether or not it will be understood when it gets where its going
3926676 you can connect things through web services but if your end points dont have a common understanding of whats flowing through the system and if you dont create a data interoperability layer then you wont have accurate communication much less a successful soa
3926677 soa teams that integrate services with an interlocking web of point to point data mappings are undermining the fundamental soa principles of loose coupling
3926678 moreover untangling this web of mappings is difficult and makes change hard and change is the one constant that the business needs to be able to manage deployed effectively a common model provides the flexibility to manage change and the ability to leverage your soa development and integration efforts
3926679 tackling the data problem in soa common models in soa based integration
3926680 the book might be offensive to some in the muslim community
3926681 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
3926682 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3926683 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
3926684 i wanted to honor aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians
3926685 dan browns controversial book the da vinci code suggested that jesus married and had children with mary magdalene the book was found offensive by some christians however it was not censored or banned in fact it was made into a box office smash movie starring tom hanks is it a double standard are books questioning the muslim faith off limits but christian books criticizing the church acceptable
3926686 court grants final approval of million gender class action settlement with smith barney
3926687 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3926688 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation
3926689 there has been significant snowfalls with strong winds and widespread avalanche activity is expected on all aspects and elevations
3926690 i know the market trends numbers whats happening on the street i use it all to my clients advantage
3926691 listening closely to my clients is the most important step to meeting their needs
3926692 we have seen a great opportunity for thai financial institutions to benefit from open solutions banking solutions
3926693 with an open architecture platform our clients and prospects will become more diverse and better able to establish themselves as universal and retail banking providers
3926694 we continue to look for advanced and innovative technology that offers our clients the highest level of operational success
3926695 we are confident this partnership with open solutions will allow us to better serve the needs of financial institutions in thailand and we look forward to working with them
3926696 as we continue our strong efforts to increase our international presence we are pleased to partner with mst the asian market is very important to us and we look forward to providing our solutions to thai financial institutions
3926697 we have a dedicated team in place to expand our presence within the international marketplace our partnership with mst further demonstrates our dedication to addressing the demand for our technology within the asian marketplace
3926698 in my travels overseas specifically in asia i have found that asian financial institutions are interested in the types of innovative banking solutions that open solutions has developed a market reputation for and our partnership with mst will provide these institutions with greater
3926699 while weve been favoring a dollar rebound in our view this has come a little bit too far too fast there are still significant headwinds for the us economy and therefore some headwinds for the dollar
3926700 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3926701 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3926702 our fourth quarter results reflect both progress and continuing challenges
3926703 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3926704 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3926705 we are pursuing our collections claim we are adamant that we get paid for the services rendered and we view this claim by the trump organisation as completely frivolous
3926706 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3926707 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3926708 the cost of fuel is clearly hitting new zealanders hard enough to make them change their behaviour
3926709 the fact that this latest poll was taken in winter is also interesting as youd expect people would turn to their cars more when the weather is bad
3926710 perhaps it shows that we often drive our cars short distances that could easily be walked instead
3926711 he will activate republican students the way another republican would talking about the military character and traditional values
3926712 part of the shed on the exterior of maximum pool and spa caught on fire and that point we got the call and it spread to two cars
3926713 in the back of our minds when were responding to a spa location there are lots of chemicals we have to be concerned with luckily today all the chemical were on the other side of the building so we didnt have to worry about that all we had to worry about was the propane tanks and the cars
3926714 with the interstate running right by and highway 6 here we had to close down both of them for a short time so there were a lot of people looking for sure
3926715 most people are on the world not in it have no conscious sympathy or relationship to anything about them undiffused separate and rigidly alone like marbles of polished stone touching but separate our crude civilization engenders a multitude of wants and law givers are ever at their wits end devising the hall and the theater and the church have been invented and compulsory education why not add compulsory recreation our forefathers forged chains of duty and habit which bind us notwithstanding our boasted freedom and we ourselves in desperation add link to link groaning and making medicinal laws for relief yet few think of pure rest or of the healing power of nature
3926716 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3926717 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3926718 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3926719 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3926720 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3926721 even though i play baseball im still a baseball fan and still watch what everybody else is doing and read the papers for cubs fans and sox fans its fun to be here
3926722 i think the fact that the cubs have played to expectations while the cardinals have been ravaged by injuries and the fact that the brewers are a very talented but inconsistent team prone to streaks has really put the cubs where they are right now
3926723 thats better than where everybody thought wed be 25 games below 500
3926724 i thought he could be a 30 home run guy
3926725 not sure a doctor can help me i mean it was accidentally the whole bottle
3926726 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic thats his own personal business
3926727 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter
3926728 unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
3926729 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
3926730 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
3926731 die kreditkrise ist breit tief und weltweit verankert ein ende noch nicht absehbar
3926732 cesa en su puesto de trabajo al que accedi libremente designado por defraudar la confianza de la junta de castilla y le n y las perspectivas de los ciudadanos de la comunidad
3926733 just set up a page mick its really easy and if you dont like it no harm no foul
3926734 what is this fie err focks of which you speak mickey
3926735 but mickey glitter theres no way she can remember if there are savings or not when she finally gets to the cash register
3926736 its no ones business what brand of insert item here the more embarrassing the better you use
3926737 but mom if you use my card to buy those four bottles of booze im gonna be the one who starts getting information about alcoholics anonymous
3926738 the industrial system offers few jobs that any self respecting person wants to do and the intelligent young are sick to death of a way of life that wastes and squanders material for the production of baubles and bombs
3926739 the enlightened one sees the world that others see but does not conceive it in the way others do as a collection of separate things other than himself for when we get the actual sense of depth from a drawing in perspective the concept is overruling the eyes as adelbert ames had constructed a whole series of experiments demonstrating that we see what we believe rather than believe what we see
3926740 the club is experiencing similar effects to the rest of the state in regards to the introduction of the new legislation but we are trying to minimise the effects by looking at ways to counter act them
3926741 weve built a smoking room to accommodate our members who wish to smoke and were continuing to look at other ways to improve other facilities to entice our patrons back to the club
3926742 trucks are part of life in our town from bread deliveries to semi trailers which operate at all hours of the day and park in any street so if someone complains about them to be fair the council should ban their use as well
3926743 how will this affect the other trucks in town are we going to have to have a truck station at polo flat if so it should apply to everybody but what will happen to the woollies truck making deliveries at 4am do we put up a barrier and say you cant bring your truck into town until 7am
3926744 right now were parking our trucks by a retirement village and weve not heard any complaints but wouldnt it be better to leave them in a rural residential property instead of the middle of town where its likely to disturb more people
3926745 on behalf of the other guys who helped build the cooma monument in 2003 dennis minahan stan howard and ian deegan and all the members of the rsl we appreciate and are proud that pat hughes will receive this recognition
3926746 flying was rare back in the 30s but pat was always interested in flying as a school boy
3926747 the last time i saw him was about 1931 or 1932 and i knew him very well he was a bright spark and a practical joker
3926748 i only know him through different stories passed down from mum and her mum pats sister dorothy noel she idolised this man out of the entire 14 kids in the family he was the only sibling she bonded to
3926749 e io faccio una preghiera e la ripeter finch la mia lingua si secchi catherine earnshaw possa tu non trovare mai riposo fin chio vivo tu dici che io ti ho uccisa
3926750 are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van
3926751 yeah i had an adrenaline rush its very common you can google it
3926752 correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
3926753 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
3926754 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
3926755 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
3926756 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
3926757 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
3926758 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
3926759 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
3926760 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
3926761 tu sei beh non esattamente lamore della mia vita perch mi aspetto di amarti molto pi a lungo sei lamore della mia esistenza
3926762 secondo la tradizione tu dovresti sostenere la mia posizione e io la tua
3926763 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
3926764 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
3926765 as in music the point of life is its pattern at every stage of its development and in a world where there is neither self nor other the only identity is just this which is all which is energy which is god by no name
3926766 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
3926767 ragazzi ma io non ho portato la carta di identit un problema
3926768 du skal alltid v re deg selv ikke pr v v re noen andre det kler deg faen meg ikke

3926772 the madc deal would reinforce our long term commitment to the realty business as we continue to look at more opportunities in the realty sector
3926773 such projects are profitable though the margins may be lower than what premium
3926774 no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come
3926775 i think thats wonderful im an adoptee and im doing research here to try and find my family
3926776 juno is to adoption as pretty woman is to prostitution
3926777 my child was beautiful and to my surprise looked liked me
3926778 i think you should be aware that motherhood packs quite a wollop
3926779 put this all behind me and get on with my life
3926780 there are people who dont believe in miracles and then there are people to whom miracles happen
3926781 carrying the picture of esther gave me comfort and company through these 16 long months i will tell her the story as soon as she can understand what happened
3926782 this was run by a mafia and we going after them
3926783 this is the first time that weve been able to show with irrefutable evidence that a stolen child was put up for adoption
3926784 my mothers instinct tells me she has already been sold for adoption
3926785 and they placed their own self interest above the well being of the children served by a c s
3926786 there is a legal complication as the father is alone and indian adoption law says a single male cant adopt a girl
3926787 yamada went to the local passport office he was told to go to the japanese embassy which asked him to get a document from an indian court to get custody of the child
3926788 i spoke to him today he cant plan anything till the babys passport is made
3926789 the surrogacy doesnt matter he is after all the biological father
3926790 the baby is alright but the grandmother is very tense
3926791 with india emerging as a destination for surrogate pregnancies a law to regulate surrogacy will have to be brought into effect
3926792 how are you defining rights how are you defining social order what is the social order that wants preserving who are the people who want to receive this social order
3926793 we have heard the concerns that have been expressed and we hope that online discussion concerning sfmoma can now return to focus on the terrific exhibitions we currently have on view
3926794 er marina posso usar seu pc pq meu pai meiqui engrossou com as bad words no meu blog
3926795 ixi pq eu uso ixi em ingles tbm haha marina acho que a torradeira tah com defeito ela funciona mais de um lado que do outro mostrando a torrada metade queimada huahua

3926800 nao quero nenhum desses turistas na minha foto passa um velho grisalho da sobrancelhona sai do meio dr albieri
3926801 i am a happy man but we must remain prudent
3926802 we know what we have done well and what we have not done well
3926803 we have scored goals and created a lot of chances and i am happy that we did not concede any goals as well because in this type of tie that is vital
3926804 at the start we had a couple of scares but m rquez and puyol have controlled things well
3926805 i tried it doesnt work i dont know to which screen the edit operation belongs
3926806 these guys take the corruption cake down to the last crumb trying to work with this incompetent lying bunch of crooks and fools has been infuriating ridiculous and sad
3926807 the lil missy was pretending to be a cat because of the prints on the underwear muahahahahahhahaahaha
3926808 claudia why dont you tell her how strict we are about being here on time
3926809 well you get here when you get here around the time youre scheduled and you leave when you leave around the time youre scheduled and if you cant make it just call in and let someone know
3926810 hmm i think ill move 5 feet down the beach
3926811 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3926812 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3926813 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3926814 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3926815 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3926816 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3926817 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3926818 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3926819 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3926820 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3926821 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3926822 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3926823 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3926824 noway you can go sleep on the ground ill go to a hotel
3926825 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3926826 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3926827 tradisi pendirian tempat ibadah di protestan atau katolik itu tidak berdasarkan geografis pada umumnya ini berbeda dengan islam yang berdasar pada batas geografis karena itu akan ada kesulitan berarti dalam menerapkan peraturan bersama 2 menteri pb 2m tentang rumah ibadah kalau tidak saling memahami tradisi masing masing agama
3926828 pokoknya kalau sudah ada gereja itu kristen padahal mereka tidak tahu adanya aliran aliran di kristen yang masing masing harus memiliki gereja
3926829 kecuali kalau syarat 90 dan 60 itu tidak berdasarkan geografis misalnya kalau umatnya 90 di manapun dia berada bisa diakui
3926830 kalau mau tekstual seperti apa adanya bisa bisa tidak ada gereja di surabaya karena masing masing aliran tinggalnya tidak di satu wilayah paling di situ ada 10 orang yang lainnya bisa lain kabupaten
3926831 ketiadaan pengaturan pendirian rumah ibadah dapat mengarah pada benturan benturan antar umat beragama dan suasana anarkis
3926832 dalam aturan ini ada beberapa jalan keluar ketika sekelompok umat beragama yang memiliki tempat ibadah tapi tidak memiliki ijin maka pemerintah wajib memfasilitasi proses perijinan itu
3926833 hal ini diasumsikan adanya kedewasaan beragama masyarakat dan juga harus antisipatif pada upaya pihak luar yang bisa mengobrak abrik kesepakatan
3926834 in a recent aarp survey of workers 45 and older one third said they had stopped contributing to their retirement plans and another 23 had tapped their retirement funds prematurely but the long term impact of doing either of these things can be devastating
3926835 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results
3926836 truly unlocked the keys to permanent fat loss they may actually suffer the same fate as jfk
3926837 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
3926838 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3926839 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3926840 it just started with a little trickle of smoke i almost felt silly phoning
3926841 an hour later the smoke was more and i didnt see anyone up there
3926842 i left it at that and an hour later it had burst into a ball of flames and i was starting to get a little more nervous and still nobody up there
3926843 shortly after that our private air show started with the planes dumping fire retardant but if they would have attacked it when i phoned at 8 oclock it wouldve been pretty easy to take care of
3926844 we sent crews up there but because of the terrain it was really hard for our crews to try and pinpoint where the smoke was coming from
3926845 gosling called like three or for times and we told dispatch we did have crews in the area
3926846 the problem also was that it was in crown land and we werent sure if it was part of our area or part of crown land
3926847 once they got up there by helicopter it made it really simple to pinpoint exactly where the fire was unfortunately by that time it was actually burning
3926848 right now its looking to be under pretty good control
3926849 we wouldnt consider it 100 per cent contained but we have a pretty good grasp of the fire
3926850 theyve got a helicopter flying over top dropping water on it
3926851 but if it does get out of control theres some houses down less than an eighth of a mile lower than the hill that could be threatened by the fire
3926852 right in the middle there the flames were probably 30 or 40 feet high
3926853 it was right in the bushes and thats what i was kind of concerned about
3926854 the coast regional fire service will be looking into the cause of the fire and the circumstances behind the area and how it got to that point
3926855 he informed me that the party has told them to decline all invitations
3926856 it sets a terrible precedent for the committee that people can just thumb their noses at us
3926857 somebody co ordinated this it was a boycott of our committee
3926858 i shouldnt have to put up with this neither should anyone else at the table
3926859 my father is 67 years old and spends a lot of time sitting there and crying now just thinking about whats happened its very emotional
3926860 the defendant city of toronto permitted sunrise to locate and operate on the premises and to carry on its dangerous operation in the vicinity of residential homes and business
3926861 the explosion and the consequent damages in the city of toronto was caused by the negligence of the defendants their agents servants or employees
3926862 technical violations of the propane code were discovered such as a hose hanging from a truck
3926863 no one should speculate based on the results of its previous inspections as to what may or may not have caused the explosion
3926864 the more firepower the better so the city and the province and sunrise know what theyre up against
3926865 their lives have been disrupted the case involves not only loss or damage to them personally but i believe the case raises fundamental issues of public responsibility
3926866 the city councils decision to delay a decision on the plant for a couple weeks is a good one because i think there are a lot of questions
3926867 itd be really helpful for that information to come out and be reviewed
3926868 there are so many changes going on in the energy industry right now it would be a good idea for austin to get its priorities based on input from the people
3926869 wynn said partnering with nacogdoches power is a valuable opportunity if austin doesnt jump on this offer someone else will he said i definitely want to act when we can control our destiny
3926870 i didnt hear a lot of complaints about the system we had in the past i would go over and wait in line with everybody else and it never was too big of a deal but now its a huge deal
3926871 but when youre on the front like and the people are waiting in line youre the one theyre going to sound off to and you cant blame the people for that
3926872 we arent achieving any efficiency that i can tell and legislators across the state are wondering just whats up with that
3926873 were really proud of the fair weve got its been here 128 years and we hope it to be another 128
3926874 were all older and we needs some new ideas and we need some younger people helping us with some of the physical work and thats why we came up with the idea of starting a junior fair board
3926875 we have the same passion that the senior fair board members have so to keep it going you kinda have to have the passion have to know what the fair is all about
3926876 it brings everybody together like i see a bunch of people from high school that i never get to see i see them here i can turn around and say hi to whoever is next to me i know them
3926877 i just thought it was pretty un cool that somebody whos supposed to be a law enforcement officer enforcing the law would be breaking the law
3926878 i think we have a pretty good police department its probably just one person i would think
3926879 right when we heard we thought it was a shame because cops are supposed to teach kids not to do drugs and to stay strong in school
3926880 its true when a first degree relative that means a mother a sister or in some cases a grown daughter gets breast cancer
3926881 i think it might the middle one the 35 because of the hereditary type things or people dont pay attention and get mammograms but then i also hear that its the upper age because of the difference in hormone levels and menopause and things like that that it makes for a higher risk
3926882 it turns out that breast cancer really is a disease for older women and that goes against our perception that younger women are at high risk for breast cancer when in fact for most patients their risk is later in life
3926883 false ive heard that lots of the time you dont feel it or know that its there
3926884 that is false because most breast cancers dont have pain at all in fact many of the symptoms of breast pain turn out to be cists mastitis another infection in the breast
3926885 if women are getting mammograms on a regular basis we should pick up breast cancer before theres ever symptoms
3926886 it is busy and overwhelming is a good word it just is amaing when youre away you just take care of the details that need to be done where you are of course when you add your home your work and siblings it all comes back and theres a lot more that plays into it
3926887 thats something that were not really hands on dealing day to day with what theyre doing but we just so appreciate it as parents that theres other people who are willing to step up and do those kind of efforts for us
3926888 right now the board president and i are trying to make as many phone calls and connections we can make throughout the community doing various fundraisers just trying to get some money out there to help some of these parents and families help offset some of the costs that theyve unexpectedly run into
3926889 the crowds there run between twenty and thirty thousand a game so we normally have 50 if that in our stands so yelling above that noise will make it a little more challenging
3926890 that was our number one concern theres 13 kids on this team and we wanted all of the parents to get an opportunity for their parents to go see them play the sport this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for these kids and for the families so thats the idea to make it not such a great financial burden on these families
3926891 i kind of went into it without much knowledge of the act
3926892 i got a thirty on the act and i was really excited because my sister got a 29 and i wanted to do better than her
3926893 they told me that because of your act score and what you did to prepare you get this money
3926894 it had a huge impact it opened up doors that maybe she wouldnt have had if she had scored a lower score she wouldnt have had the scholarship opportunities that she received
3926895 you dont take it lightly because it does affect your future
3926896 it makes me proud to be a parent of a student in south dakota it makes me proud to be an employee of sioux falls school district
3926897 theres nothing quite like a dirty weekend in the scottish countryside this event brings us back to our roots in the outdoors and were delighted to be able to offer such a thorough format as we have been able to muster with the dirty weekend

3926907 she was upset by the misleading comments about being a victim of technology
3926908 i couldnt believe that this could happen to someone as young active and healthy as deidra
3926909 it seems like more women in their 30s are being diagnosed and i think its scary however it may be a reflection of better technology and doctors being trained to find it earlier
3926910 she spent hours on the internet reading legitimate sites and staying away from the blogs with the horror stories
3926911 she has extensively researched information about breast cancer and her particular situation so that she is knowledgeable of all the facts and she is managing her recovery with great fortitude
3926912 she has a fire inside that she channels to help deal with the situation
3926913 the race will have a more special meaning for me this year
3926914 its more than a place to work out were a sisterhood of sorts
3926915 i want her to concentrate on her treatment work and jazzercise the last two are important because it helps her to keep as normal a routine as possible
3926916 they are a fantastic bunch and i couldnt ask for more sincere genuine caring people than my jazzercise ladies
3926917 here at work she doesnt let this get her down her professionalism is still what it has always been and she is on the ball
3926918 dont panic if you are faced with the word cancer and listen to the doctors and experts rather than well meaning family and friends
3926919 i think the best thing they can do is offer support but not advice
3926920 its a very simple act but it means a lot to know people care
3926921 to help ease her son into the certainty of losing her hair she went out and had it cut real short to make the loss a bit less dramatic for james
3926922 i understand the worry she went through and i have a greater appreciation for all she did
3926923 he is so full of energy that even if she is feeling down he gets her laughing in an instant and takes her mind off the situation for a while
3926924 i love her with all my heart and plan on growing old with her
3926925 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3926926 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3926927 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about u s policy

3926930 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3926931 well try to reforest all of the city not just going into areas where we lost trees in the past but going to areas where the environment can be modified
3926932 you can reforest the city and youll barely recognize it 10 years later the heat effect is down real estate is up it benefits all of us in so many ways
3926933 we need to balance qualify of life with their concerns about safety
3926934 their work is judged from a utility point of view
3926935 once we are able to reduce the risks we will be able to dedicate even more resources toward tree care and replenishment
3926936 for example the city planted 200 more trees last year than the year before we hope to increase new plantings in each coming year

3926938 we have people in beijing who are meeting with ioc members during the olympics
3926939 there will be a vote in the fall of 2009 our effort is to be successful with that vote in getting baseball restored to the olympics in 2016
3926940 but that is a significant issue we play every day and commissioner bud selig has indicated an unwillingness to shut down the season but there are alternatives that are being discussed that could provide some comfort to the ioc in terms of quality of players
3926941 i think taking players off major league rosters would be a difficult scenario
3926942 it would be a shame to not have baseball there
3926943 but at the same time i dont really want to go back on the dl
3926944 it seems like against lefties its a better situation to dh since stairs is our normal dh
3926945 ill just dh on those days its kind of like a day off but not really it just kind of gives the legs a break trying to get back instead of overworking them and trying to do too much
3926946 im just conscious of trying to just run smoother just try not to overstride
3926947 you get into trouble running wise when you start trying to run as hard as you can because you start overstriding and your form is bad you put yourself in risk of re injuring something
3926948 both injuries are kind of freakish injuries in what i did and how i did them hopefully this is the last season i have with injuries like that
3926949 they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled

3926965 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3926966 conventionally they are normally adept at trying to hide their true origins for such a siege on the scale of this one they are openly showing more of their routing than they would like to which will assist us now and in the future in this case it helped pin point some obviously forged web sites which are now offline and assist in rerouting good lessons for future cyber wars
3926967 many outlets are claiming that the russian government is behind the attacks but no one seems to have any proof
3926968 unfortunately we have no proof either and we have no proof to the contrary what i can say without a doubt is that only the perpetrators know for sure who is behind it
3926969 we have seen many different ddos attacks from these particular c amp c servers but there doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason to it
3926970 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online after math by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizer

3926974 and now dear brothers and sisters i will write about the special abilities the holy spirit gives to each of us for i dont want you to be ignorant concerning them so i want you to know how to discern what is truly from god no one speaking by the spirit of god can curse jesus and no one is able to say

3927003 the blow caused the glass to smash that was seen by a number of staff in the pub and an ambulance and police were called

3927007 the mayor and city department heads have suggested that this is the model that needs to be followed to effectuate change
3927008 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3927009 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3927010 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3927011 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3927012 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3927013 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3927014 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3927015 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3927016 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3927017 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3927018 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3927019 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3927020 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3927021 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3927022 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3927023 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3927024 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3927025 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3927026 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3927027 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3927028 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3927029 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3927030 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3927031 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3927032 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3927033 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3927034 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project

3927038 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthyness the flagship withdrew from the firing area

3927041 we have coordinated the text of the entire document with president saakashvili and introduced certain corrections
3927042 the ministers will approve the document it will become a resolution and will have legal force
3927043 we are signing this document about the basic principles under the conditions of the humanitarian catastrophe the most important aspect of the document is to cease fire the regulation process should be initialized
3927044 the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly they are doing great damage to their ability to do that
3927045 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3927046 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3927047 despite the agreements on peaceful regulation of the situation in the zone of the georgian ossetian conflict and contrary to the un charter georgias armed forces illegally invaded the territory of south ossetia on august 8 2008 using aviation and heavy artillery the armed forces of georgia attempted to seize south ossetia exterminating its civilians georgia has thus committed genocide of the south ossetian nation destroyed the city of tskhinvali and other settlements which resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe in south ossetia
3927048 in addition georgia attacked the military contingent of the armed forces of the russian federation which was deployed in the region in accordance with international agreements to normalize the situation in the area of the georgian ossetian conflict this is classified as an act of aggression as per resolution of the un general assembly of december 14 1974
3927049 the first principle not to use force the second to definitively stop all military actions the third to provide free access to humanitarian aid the fourth georgias armed forces must return to the places of their permanent deployment the fifth russias armed forces will be withdrawn to the positions preceding the beginning of the military actions the sixth the start of the international discussion of issues of the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia by means of guaranteeing their solid security
3927050 the operation which the russian forces were conducting has brought its results that is why we have ended it
3927051 it was supposed to be done today not yesterday or tomorrow we herewith made a temporal decision to cease fire until the problem is entirely solved within the framework of the principles which we have just named
3927052 as for the affirmation of the georgian president who said that georgia ceased fire in the conflict zone two days ago these are lies
3927053 the georgian forces were shelling peacemakers unfortunately there were victims yesterday in other words there was no cease fire with georgia
3927054 this is what differs those hell raisers from normal people it is very hard to stop them when they smell blood
3927055 all the rest will have no point without this condition south ossetian residents will hardly understand that they can return and restore their homes without this condition if georgia does not accept this condition we will be forced to take other measures not to let the current situation which has been formed as a result of georgias aggression repeat itself this is the absolute condition for everything else
3927056 the fact that the president of france has completely agreed with that is important we hope that the president of france will inform the georgian administration of these principles
3927057 we are bidding final farewell to the soviet union the ussr will never come back here we urge ukraine and other members of the cis to leave the organization which russia administers
3927058 russian forces are turning gori over to georgian police on thursday morning
3927059 in an interview wednesday with cbs evening news anchor katie couric georgia president mikhail saakashvili sounded a defiant note
3927060 russians have been telling us that we should give up fight for freedom that we should succumb to this pressure no matter how they bomb us no matter how many of us they kill no matter how they want to terrorize us we will never give up our freedom georgia will never ever surrender he told couric

3927064 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
3927065 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
3927066 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board
3927067 even if by some luck president musharraf survives and carries on the military wants to make clear that it would have no responsibility for that outcome

3927082 he had a temperature of 105 and he was hallucinating and you
3927083 i cant give him anything to reduce the fever because that will worsen his chills
3927084 the tylenol should keep the fever in check id suggest you give his primary care physician a call in the morning to discuss additional treatment options
3927085 you wasted time so a doctor could tell me to take two tylenol really you gotta stop watching so many soap operas
3927086 and hell say the same thing that this guy did
3927087 i called the doctor and now youre going to do what i want you to do

3927229 when steve bruce came everybody started looking at different things and he shook the team up and put the discipline a bit right

3927270 we went to the state fair when she was 6 months old and they were having a miniature horse auction
3927271 being the size she is and the age she is and the temperament of the horses they werent so overpowering it was something she could handle instead of a 15 or 16 hand horse
3927272 the whole idea when you show them is to set them up and get their feet square and get their neck to stretch kind of wiggle your fingers or have some bait like hay to make them pay attention
3927273 must not measure more than 34 inches at the withers the last hairs of the mane
3927274 miniature versions of well balanced horses possessing confirmation characteristics found in most equine breeds
3927275 shes trained all the horses herself she teaches other kids how to show the horses and lets kids who dont have their own horses show her horses
3927276 the people who owned the pony were concerned after it went to the youth committee
3927277 they picked kimberly over two older kids to win the horse after they found out her age they questioned if she could handle a modern shetland but others who knew her said she wouldnt have any problem with it
3927278 be gentle with the horses theyre pretty easy to train feed them twice a day and be sure to exercise them every day
3927279 im going to ask foster if he needs his diaper changed if he doesnt he can say no thank you ill leave this here for him in case he wants it later
3927280 mommy im looking left and im looking right but i dont see any baseball
3927281 time is a companion that goes with us on a journey it reminds us to cherish each moment because it will never come again what we leave behind is not as important as how we have lived
3927282 tonight i am publicly stating that i am an alcoholic
3927283 i was in denial about it and the problem was getting worse
3927284 my father was bipolar manic depressive alcoholic and a genius
3927285 my father was an enormous influence on myself in spite of the fact that he left my mother and i when i was 3 1 2 i am genetically linked to my father
3927286 three weeks ago i came out of the betty ford center
3927287 my closest friends in the world except for those in my family had no knowledge of this
3927288 this is my favorite place in the world i played here in 72 73 74
3927289 and what was ironic when i drove up was that i realized this journey has been going on for so many years and the journey is now every day 24 hours to stay sober
3927290 before this event happened i went to my dad and said this could be a big thing for you
3927291 to see him up here and telling you all this is one of the greatest things that i could ever hope to be able to be a part of
3927292 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appear to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
3927293 love is measure on how much you are willing to do for that person and how
3927294 noto con piacere che molti presidi stanno informando il ministero del fatto che stanno reintroducendo il grembiule
3927295 anche se mi piacerebbe pensare pi allintroduzione della divisa nelle scuole sul modello di alcune nazioni europee
3927296 vestirsi nello stesso modo magari con lo stemma dellistituto appuntato sulla giacca suscita un senso di appartenenza e aiuterebbe tante famiglie oggi in difficolt a causa della corsa alle griffe corsa che comincia proprio fra i banchi di scuola
3927297 per rivalutare il ruolo degli insegnanti spiega la gelmini necessario che i genitori non siano sempre i sindacalisti dei propri figli credo che le famiglie non debbano sempre dare ragione ai propri figli o in qualche modo fare i sindacalisti dei figli ma debbano creare una collaborazione con gli insegnanti
3927298 anzi crea un cortocircuito continua con gli insegnanti e anche un disorientamento quindi pi rigore sia da parte degli insegnanti che delle famiglie
3927299 un provvedimento normativo che possa dare agli insegnanti uno strumento importante di valutazione
3927300 il giudizio complessivo sulla maturit degli studenti ha spiegato dipende certo dalle verifiche sulle singole materie ma anche dai comportamenti
3927301 personalmente ha detto gelmini non mi sono detta contraria agli esami di riparazione mantenendo comunque il recupero a scuola in questo modo ha spiegato non si grava sulle famiglie perche corretto che sia la scuola a fornire le ore di insegnamento necessarie per superare le insufficienze senza rivolgersi a insegnanti privati e quindi con un costo per le famiglie
3927302 con le modifiche normative che scatteranno da settembre 2009 rivedremo gli orari delle singole materie e dei cicli scolastici sar quella la sede per valutare se lasciare agli studenti il sabato libero ma mantenendo il tempo pieno perch credo sia importante per le famiglie
3927303 mi auguro che non sar necessario tornare al maestro unico
3927304 non abbiamo assunto nessuna decisione di tornare al maestro unico e chiaro che razionalizzare la rete scolastica impone alcune scelte ma credo che le elementari siano un ciclo scolastico che funziona lo dicono anche i dati ocse pisa e quindi mi auguro che non sar necessario tornare al maestro unico
3927305 lobbligo rimane a 16 anni ha precisato abbiamo solo introdotto un emendamento che consente di adempierlo anche attraverso il canale della formazione professionale
3927306 non voglio essere responsabile ha detto il ministro di distribuire illusioni credo sia doveroso mettere uno stop e poi valutare insieme come andare avanti intanto coloro che lanno scorso hanno gi iniziato il primo anno delle ssis completeranno
3927307 in passato si sono fatte promesse che poi non sono state mantenute i ragazzi non hanno certezze di un percorso professionale la sinistra dice il ministro ha continuamente creato precariato bisogna fare unoperazione di trasparenza sono stati immessi solamente 25 mila insegnanti invece dei 150 mila previsti il numero delle immissioni diminuisce di anno in anno a causa delle difficolt economiche occorre rivedere le norme di reclutamento che vanno cambiate con le parti sociali
3927308 per chi non ha ancora iniziato le ssis chiarisce il ministro stiamo pensando invece di reintrodurre il tirocinio credo che sia inutile dopo una laurea si debbano fare ulteriori due anni di approfondimento forse meglio introdurre il praticantato di un anno nelle classi
3927309 il sistema spiega cos non regge e con gli strumenti di oggi non possiamo dare risposte va cambiato il reclutamento
3927310 considerata la vicenda dolorosa delle risorse della scuola che vanno diminuendo dice linquilino di palazzo della minerva ho deciso di mettere i bilanci in rete potranno essere consultati dalla prossima settimana via internet
3927311 i think i wear my hair in a pony tail today

3927315 i think youll find that this is the real deal
3927316 my mother maxine simpson is probably one of the biggest reasons why im running because she used to run and she stopped because she got pregnant with my big brother 24 year old omar she also has a 20 year old brother andrew
3927317 my mother encourages me a lot and i really love her because when nobody else was there she always made sure to provide for us by peddling goods
3927318 ive worked really hard for this so its an honour to go under 11 seconds
3927319 im humble that i really put in a lot of hard work to get to where i am now
3927320 laid back and wants to achieve as much as possible
3927321 i was born in kingston and grew up in a tenement yard in waterhouse and went to george headley primary school on baldwin crescent in duhaney park
3927322 i ran at primary champs bare footed and my last year is actually when i won my first medal coming second in the 100m and then i went to wolmers girls school
3927323 wolmers was like the first milestone honestly because thats what created who i am now
3927324 i just want to go out there and do my best and im anticipating great results so for me its just great honestly to be here in beijing

3927327 jadi bagi pihak presiden umno dan juga pengerusi bn saya umumkan calon bn adalah datuk arif shah
3927328 saya nak kata di sini kalau yang tidak terpilih sebagai calon bukan bererti sudah kelam masa depan kalau kita pilih bukan bererti beliau juga disahkan sebagai ketua bahagian

3927335 i was infected my senior year in high school i didnt know anything about hiv we never talked about hiv
3927336 america this is your caricature based on your prejudice and ignorance
3927337 whilst not all non native species are harmful many pose real problems to our native wildlife to boaters and to our historic channels locks and bridges
3927338 with no natural predators to control them they can overwhelm wildlife channels banks and towpaths
3927339 british waterways invests a large amount of time and money to protect our canals and rivers through identifying monitoring and controlling damaging species
3927340 this is very costly and diverts resources that could be used elsewhere on the waterway network
3927341 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3927342 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3927343 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
3927344 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
3927345 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3927346 there is a lot of sensitive data on our laptops
3927347 besides the employees own personal information there are often product drawings and schematics these are highly confidential
3927348 hes put forward a good idea we are seriously considering it
3927349 when it comes to victims rights judges are not onside
3927350 what steps do you take to get motivated to get healthy
3927351 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
3927352 but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now

3927378 last year we earned 1 300 a second and our quarterly profit just released was 11 7 billion and that beat the previous all time high record profit for any corporation of 11 6 billion posted for the last quarter of 2007
3927379 think about it boy we have more money than god and the goddamn government gives us tax breaks and subsidies ill tell you something else that will make you laugh did you notice the price for a barrel of oil has dropped over 20 over the last few weeks and we are still charging pretty much the same price at the pump now tell me how do you think we can get by doing that without the support of the president
3927380 our president is not only taking care of this country he hasnt forgotten his friends hell boy when those goddamn iraqis thought they were going to sell oil and leave us sitting in the back seat the president showed all those dirty sons of a bitch that you cant fuck with him
3927381 and i will tell you another thing son that fucker in iran better start doing bidness with us if he knows what the hell is good for him because bush wont screw with the little bastard putin is another fucker he is bombing our in georgia and he knows that we wont stand for him messing with us that is why we got over there right now
3927382 well i gotta go now i got a meeting with the senator about his re election so who did you say you were again
3927383 well i was just interested in finding out if there really were people that still supported the president they were kind of hard to find
3927384 now tell me boy you wouldnt be one of those liberal do gooders that say that we are making too much money hell that is the american way to make as much as you can when you can and to fuck with everyone else you cant blame a company for turning a profit or for making sure politicians are on their side
3927385 but what about america and the world mr vp do you ever feel guilty
3927386 get out of my office you little fucker who the fuck let your sorry ass in here anyway ill make sure our security knows who you are and you wont get within miles of here again

3927391 winning coverage of the u s presidential campaign and other political contests
3927392 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
3927393 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3927394 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3927395 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3927396 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3927397 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3927398 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3927399 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3927400 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3927401 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
3927402 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
3927403 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy
3927404 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
3927405 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way

3927411 bellas really the only vampire who went into it knowing what to expect being mentally prepared and on guard for her reactions and shes a naturally stubborn person which helps when you make up your mind to do something
3927412 they had a good chance of holding their own not winning there wouldnt have been a lot of people walking away from that and because im kind of a happy ending girl i didnt want the hamlet ending where everyones dead on the floor and one persons standing there giving their monologue about what theyve learned i wanted it to be something that could be won so i set it up to be a mental game
3927413 if i were to go ahead with the cullen universe the narrators that i would go ahead with would be renesmee and leah leahs the other one whose story doesnt seem resolved to me at this point
3927414 weve always practiced that way for 28 years and i can honestly tell you i have never lost a quarterback in practice we havent lost that many in games either not to that weve had guys tear their knee up or something like that i think if you went back and looked at it youd find dropback quarterbacks get hit a hell of lot harder than these guys
3927415 weve practiced 17 days and we havent had a quarterback miss a day of practice a guy gets a bruise on his shoulder and were going to change the way we practice how does georgia practice theyve lost a bunch of guys havent they
3927416 the kids are playing faster because they understand the scheme better
3927417 we still arent where we need to be but were making progress every day when you play fast youve got a chance when you have to stop and think about everything its hard to play
3927418 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate are deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small doesnt serve the world theres nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presense automatically liberates others

3927423 das aufkommende f nf parteien system zwingt die spd zur linkspartei prinzipieller stellung zu nehmen
3927424 wenn sie es falsch macht wird es dazu f hren dass die linkspartei st rker wird als die spd in der neuesten umfrage ist der abstand bei 20 prozent f r die spd und 14 prozent f r die linkspartei schon auf nur noch 6 prozent geschrumpft insofern ist hessen eine art labor der ausgang wird entscheidenden einfluss auf die nationale politik haben da sollte sich niemand etwas vormachen und nach hessen kann der spd nicht mehr geglaubt werden dass sie etwas anders machen w rde als in hessen wenn es ihr keiner mehr glaubt wird sie es irgendwann auch machen denn warum soll man eigentlich den maximalen schaden von unglaubw rdigkeit erzielen um dann das was ohnehin alle erwarten nicht zu tun
3927425 wenn die gro e volkspartei spd ihre kernidentit t verletzt und zu einer randpartei w rde dann steht sie im wettbewerb mit einer anderen randpartei die k nnen beide durchaus stark sein aber ob dann der eine 17 und der andere 19 prozent der stimmen hat ist politischer zufall und abh ngig vom charisma der leitfiguren eine prinzipielle frage ist das dann nicht mehr man muss auch die gr e haben mit 35 prozent opposition zu sein und sollte nicht davon tr umen mit 22 prozent regierung zu werden die frage ist ob die spd noch die kraft hat sich der politischen geiselnahme von frau ypsilanti zu erwehren in jeder normal funktionierenden partei m sste ein machtwort der bundesf hrung einen solchen spuk beenden beck scheint sich nicht zu trauen und steinmeier scheint lieber auf appeasement kurs zu gehen als mit einem klaren machtwort seine kandidatur vorzubereiten

3927430 well were estimating that a million dollars will actually do about five and a half miles of street repair
3927431 as we all know potholes are not a permanent pothole fixing is not a permanent repair for streets but it can really go a long way towards helping to smooth the ride for folks who would otherwise be bounding their way around town
3927432 at a time when an illegal and immoral war rages on its imperative that we support those men and women who refuse to fight and participate in such a devastating war we cant turn our backs on those active duty members who stand up and say no more portland has a unique opportunity to be a leader in supporting the emerging gi movement in this country

3927440 revamp client service clients today are looking for agencies with which they can build solid partnerships clients want to feel confident that their agencies can offer all of the strategies they need to get the message out about their brands more importantly given the evolution of the commercial free media clients want agencies to use the most creative options available to reach consumers agencies must develop a full spectrum of multi media solutions based on client needs account directors will be required to masterfully develop advertising strategies that bundle print and tv ads with digital media and integrated marketing solutions by broadening their service portfolios agencies can establish themselves as one stop shops for clients once agencies can deliver the services to satisfy clients they must motivate account executives to sell the services agencies will need to retool account management in order to engrain a partnership approach one step would be to structure compensation such that ad execs are motivated to offer clients a breadth of services i e rewarding account executives who successfully develop and implement creative solutions beyond traditional print and tv advertising

3927444 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3927445 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3927446 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3927447 we had retail sales that were in line with expectations so not earth shattering but being in line with expectations is not good enough these days so that was a further threat to equities
3927448 the markets were due for a correction because of falling crude and falling commodities but these are not good enough to lift markets because prices are still above levels seen last year
3927449 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3927450 doesnt perceive me as being terribly famous he thinks of will ferrell as being famous
3927451 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
3927452 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
3927453 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
3927454 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3927455 i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily
3927456 so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy
3927457 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
3927458 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3927459 we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3927460 some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home

3927462 children are not mere chattels nor are they toys for their parents simply because the father loves his children and is not shown to be otherwise undesirable does not lead to the conclusion that the welfare of the children would be better promoted by granting their custody to the father the court should ascertain the wishes the of the child while taking a final decision on his or her custody
3927463 this will incentivise everyone in the country to earn more
3927464 the mcguinty government is committed to supporting our amateur athletes who inspire us to be active and healthy with the help of our partners like the sport alliance of ontario we will continue to provide opportunities for our athletes to compete
3927465 ottawa has done an exceptional job of hosting these games in the past and i am confident that the 2008 ontario summer games will be equally memorable for all those participating
3927466 this is the fourth time ottawa has had the pleasure of hosting the ontario summer games
3927467 we value the opportunity to host ontarios exceptional athletes and showcase the amazing things our city has to offer

3927469 the ontario summer games offers something for every sports fan and provides all of us with the opportunity to cheer on the provinces brightest young athletes

3927479 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation ame capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3927480 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours

3927482 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer

3927484 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions

3927498 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3927507 because our nation was founded on the principle of self determination we are understandably uncomfortable depriving others of that right but american independence was based on a doctrine of individual rights whereas the vast majority of self determination movements today are based on ethnic group rights

3927702 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3927703 conventionally they are normally adept at trying to hide their true origins for such a siege on the scale of this one they are openly showing more of their routing than they would like to which will assist us now and in the future in this case it helped pin point some obviously forged web sites which are now offline and assist in rerouting good lessons for future cyber wars
3927704 many outlets are claiming that the russian government is behind the attacks but no one seems to have any proof

3927824 since their introduction into land based birds in 1988 h9n2 avian influenza a viruses have caused multiple human infections and become endemic in domestic poultry in eurasia
3927825 this particular influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans
3927826 although no aerosol transmission was observed the virus replicated in multiple respiratory tissues and induced clinical signs similar to those observed with the parental human h3n2 virus
3927827 our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of h9n2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans

3927851 adaptive mechanisms for inferring harmful intentions which can account for rapid yet not necessarily accurate judgments from faces
3927852 overall people do a pretty bad job when it comes to judging people based on appearances
3927853 should we continue to rely on making decisions based on appearances or should we actually be taking steps to ignore them
3927854 if people use faces or appearances to draw their impressions of others
3927855 they must be doing that because they think those assumptions are correct if you couldnt get any good information from appearances then a rational person wouldnt use this information to make their decisions
3927856 what about that face is making people say it looks trustworthy or untrustworthy
3927857 when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear trustworthy the face appears as if its smiling and when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear untrustworthy it appears as if is angry
3927858 there is a tendency in our field to do what is described as the reverse inference you see that a particular brain region is active and from this you make an inference about the persons psychology or emotional state for instance if i see that the amygdala is active i might infer that the person is afraid however if the shape of the curve is u shaped this is not a valid inference to make
3927859 when you see someone and you think i can tell hes smart most people are actually pretty confident in their own judgment but it turns out that youre not really accurate most of the time and if our theory is correct it turns out that among other things your system for detecting emotions is inappropriately overgeneralizing

3927876 el a o pasado se concertaron en la provincia de huesca 6 762 resonancias magn ticas con un coste total de 1 022 163 euros
3927877 el precio concertado con este centro es de 120 euros por cada resonancia
3927878 el coste de una unidad fija de resonancia magn tica para las arcas p blicas es de 2 millones de euros y su mantenimiento asciende a medio mill n de euros anuales
3927879 en dos a os el coste de la unidad est cubierto por lo que se demuestra que el salud es el que deber a prestar el servicio y de esta manera apostar por una sanidad p blica y de calidad
3927880 la apuesta del salud por la privatizaci n continua no abarata los costes sino que supone el desv o de dinero p blico a empresas privadas
3927881 los ciudadanos de la provincia y de la zona oriental de huesca sean atendidos en la zona con servicios p blicos y el sistema de salud de arag n tenga entre sus fines asegurar la efectividad eficacia y calidad en la presentaci n de los servicios y lo haga con sus propios medios sin utilizar la v a de la concertaci n privatizaci n
3927882 el gobierno de arag n parece que solo puede garantizar la calidad en la prestaci n si lo hace concertando servicios de eficiencia y efectividad dudosa y no consolidando un sistema p blico m s eficiente
3927883 est formula consolida la privatizaci n del servicio sanitario p blico y de esta manera empobrece las condiciones de trabajo de los profesionales sanitarios incrementa la factura de la sanidad y permite el negocio a dos entidades privadas es decir al propio consorcio y a la empresa subcontratada

3927888 the problem is that the jury summons that used to be served personally so that there was proof of service on the juror now its sent regular mail which is inefficient and an impossible way to know they received notice
3927889 bring this summons with you herein fail not under penalty of law by order of the court
3927890 the existing system is simply unfair to the responsible few that appear for jury service
3927891 the question came up after the grand jury was selected how does that happen why are so few of us cause thats not fair to us when any number of other people didnt show up and thats a very legitimate concern
3927892 well i think we should find some way as a group to include in our jury summons a more demanding of the presence of the person whos being summoned
3927893 we need to look at that issue and we need to make a decision as a court how expensive it is to subpoena jurors to have them come here whats the cost of doing that

3927988 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable

3928045 when we look at more localised studies reporting etc we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey

3928051 are presuming that they dont have an ideological kook in front of them they presume that they have a committed educator who is presenting facts rather than some liberal unionized hack thats presenting a pile of garbage thats being tossed out there by a failed politician
3928052 so these kids are going to end up when they realize that global warming was all a scam and they learned it you know they learned it in school they so deeply believed theyre gonna end up with an incredible distrust of everything thats not all bad any time we can break someones trust in a greedy overpaid unionized schoolteacher thats a good thing rather than a bad thing
3928053 you know what a fruitcake your teacher is your teachers been voting for one left wing hack after another after another after another the only thing that your teacher does his entire summer is take a look at his pension statement to watch to figure out how much money hes gonna make when he gets to retire when hes 55 years old
3928054 do you think that they even are aware that up here in the upper midwest weve been freezing our butts off all summer no they dont know that

3928104 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3928108 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3928120 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3928121 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3928122 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3928123 the offenders had a purpose for going to the address
3928124 we will be talking to parents friends and family to get a clearer picture of what this 14 year old boy was really like
3928125 a good 14 year old boy from a good family
3928126 there is a reason for these two people to come to this address there is a motive behind it and over the next few days we will find out firstly the motive and the identity
3928127 we just asked the neighbours people in the general area to search their sections and if they find any weapons handguns or hammers to notify police straight away
3928128 they would have told someone what has happened and we really need those people to come forward
3928129 creemos que ha sido una actitud her ica de leonel y su equipo econ mico por mantener al pa s de pie en estos momentos y gracias quiz s a las magn ficas relaciones que tiene con hugo chavez y el gobierno venezolano
3928130 creo que hemos tenido altibajos porque perfectos no hemos sido porque hemos descuidado algunas reas hemos atendido otras mejor hemos cometidos errores hemos cometidos aciertos
3928131 no thats a nice thing not like you cursed at them
3928132 nope who cares i duno how people argue over stupid stuff
3928133 i dont think its that wrong i suppose it could piss someone off a little
3928134 its disrespectful because you touched someones car property without permission
3928135 def no when it is 4 30 in the morning the car is in the street the owner will never know because the 7am sun will melt the dew away no harm is done to the car and the insides are swimming in liqueur
3928136 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3928137 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3928138 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3928139 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3928140 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3928141 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
3928142 last year has got nothing to do with it now
3928143 we had a good record at tynecastle last year and lost this year
3928144 this weekend it is solely about us and them on the day and we will not be concerning ourselves with last years results
3928145 im not quite sure how they are feeling about their defeat but we dont feel all that bad about ours
3928146 we go into the game in a positive frame of mind that is all we can do
3928147 a few people i spoke to at the celtic game on sunday were talking about clarky and they seemed to think he played better than i thought he played
3928148 we know him intimately and know how well he can play and there is more to come
3928149 ive had no sleep and thinking about the game reminds me just how dreadful we were
3928150 i watched the dvd last night monday when i got home again at six oclock this morning and then i went through the first half again because i wanted to get to the bottom of it
3928151 we didnt defend properly and the things weve worked on time after time this summer went out the window
3928152 we didnt defend throw ins corners or set pieces properly and almost everything they did was causing us a problem
3928153 to be honest our keeper saved us from further embarrassment
3928154 we arent the type of club who can go out and buy big
3928155 we know we have to identify players who will come in and enhance our squad but who are also within our budget
3928156 that is why we tend to look at the lower leagues and players who have got a hunger and desire to make a name for themselves in the top flight or experienced players where for one reason or another things havent worked out for them at other clubs
3928157 these boys have big futures ahead of them and im in no doubt they along with others can really kick on over the next couple of seasons
3928158 donivans extremely quick and looks a real prospect so we decided to get him on loan
3928159 in my defence i felt i was a bit of a target for the referees in england last season
3928160 i was booked 11 times but i felt hard done by because i was only looking after myself in the games
3928161 the aberdeen manager has warned me that the refs up here are very strict
3928162 things have happened in the past when i was a bit younger that i do regret
3928163 steven has joined us for a year and i am delighted to have finalised the deal
3928164 he is a good player already even though he is still just a young boy
3928165 it is always a good sign when a big club like genoa signs you on a five year contract from someone like monaco
3928166 then he signed for genoa and i heard that they would consider sending him out on loan for a year
3928167 he may be a young player but he has already proved that he can score a lot of goals he already has in a relatively short career
3928168 we will take him at first on loan for six months then maybe after if he is happy we can talk about a transfer
3928169 we have been looking for a first choice goalkeeper because steve has been doing a great job but he is the goalkeeping coach not the real goalkeeper
3928170 balogh is a young goalkeeper and he has the experience
3928171 he is a two time hungarian champion and two time hungarian cup winner

3928176 weve been really truly affected by transportation regulations we still pay the cost of the vehicle and driver for our regular deliveries and now we have to pay yet another one for the other days
3928177 changing from the big trucks to little trucks has really increased the cost and hassle of doing business
3928178 difficult to get trucks from the fourth and fifth ring roads only a few hours are permitted each night and there are long queues
3928179 you might have to wait a whole other day before you can get your products in
3928180 some of the vendors need more lead time for deliveries i had to rent an even numbered vehicle
3928181 had to learn to mix lemon juice sugar and water it sorta worked
3928182 with the freshness and price considerations of the products suppliers dont want to take the risk they dont know the exact time of deliveries or how long a product will be kept waiting
3928183 if they send me the product spoilt i will for sure reject it and the supplier will lose money
3928184 local authorities say be careful make sure no terrorist puts poison in your food but its just to make it seem as though theyre doing something to the officials up on top
3928185 dont have f business visas so theyre not permitted to wear one of our t shirts while working here
3928186 beijing is all dressed up but no one is going
3928187 its difficult to factor in the olympics because prices have been rising regardless
3928188 well son let me try to explain it this way i am the head of the family so call me the president your mother is the administrator of the money so we call her the government we are here to take care of your needs so we will call you the people the nanny we will consider her the working class and your baby brother we will call him the future now think about that and see if it makes sense
3928189 dad i think i understand the concept of politics now
3928190 good son tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about

3928225 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3928226 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3928227 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3928228 why cant he get move on what is wrong with him
3928229 these problems have been emerging for the last six to 12 years we have a record of inaction by our predecessors
3928230 what weve done is taken every possible measure available to us in the last six months to try and turn this disaster around and it is a real problem
3928231 i believe the lower lakes are an absolute environmental priority for the nation in which case governments of all persuasions need to do whatever is physically possible to make sure that this asset is preserved as best as is possible
3928232 weve begun that process weve dedicated 3 1 billion to the purchase back of further water entitlements across the system thats what were engaged in
3928233 cabinet will then look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on the system
3928234 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another
3928235 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong and the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here
3928236 but it does present a risk and our priority is to remove that risk
3928237 this is the only living animal ever thats beat the virus

3928249 your ceo of someone like that may have a disciplinary issue with a staff member today and tonight you may have that same staff member here in council it is just unworkable
3928250 what we want them to do if they arent going to take that out completely is to change it to what you had to do previously when you wanted to do that have a worker become an alderman to get the local government ministers permission
3928251 i dont think its a particularly a bad thing but wed like to see what plans they have for picking up the overflow of traffic and we hope its not pushing it out to the peripheral of the city because that will discourage people from coming in

3928260 the million dollar question is what the impact of higher cotton and energy costs are and to what degree we recover these cost increases and prices
3928261 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3928262 we need something with some teeth in it which i believe is what we have in this ordinance that we can go ahead and remove it its been proven that if you can remove graffiti within 24 to 48 hours you may have to do it a couple of times but then they wont come back and repeat writing graffiti on that particular area theyll either move on to other areas or stop
3928263 were trying to get permission to go in and clean that stuff up add were just having a hard time tracking them down to do it or some people just say no and so what this ordinance does it provides us the authority after we give notification to go onto private property and remove that graffiti
3928264 we live in the united states we still want to have the freedom of speech and do what we want to do but it cant be carried to destruction of property

3928273 there are a lot of misconceptions a lot of people believe that you dont have to have a motorcycle endorsement that you can just buy a scooter and let anyone go ride it down the street
3928274 in idaho they are classified as a motorcycle so you have to have an endorsement
3928275 you could be cited for not having that and you would have to make an appearance in court

3928319 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3928320 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3928321 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3928322 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3928323 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3928324 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3928325 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3928326 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3928327 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3928328 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3928329 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3928330 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3928346 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3928347 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3928348 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3928350 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3928351 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3928352 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3928353 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3928354 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3928355 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3928356 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3928357 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3928358 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3928359 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3928360 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3928361 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3928362 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3928363 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3928364 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3928365 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3928366 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3928367 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3928368 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3928369 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3928370 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3928371 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3928372 tolonglah bantu saya kalau dibantu saya akan bantu rakyat kecil
3928373 pejabat pemerintah tidak perhatian sama sekali kepada kami para pejuang
3928374 of course canadians drive on the wrong side of the road
3928375 but i must say that i am saddened by the thought of lovely deserted uoleva island being built up with expat homes
3928376 unfortunately the news i hear coming out of england is not good swamped by immigrants soaring crime rate and high cost of living
3928377 our main oversight in moving to greece was totally underestimating the economy and the effect the euro has had on the quality of life here
3928378 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
3928379 in recognition when i met him i also saw my christmas card on their refrigerator
3928380 tim gill has a mission stop the rick santorums of tomorrow before they get started how a network of gay political donors is stealthily reshaping american politics
3928381 i ts often just a handful of people two or three who introduce the most outrageous legislation and force the rest of their colleagues to vote on it
3928382 if you could reach these few people or neutralize them by flipping the chamber to leaders who would block bad legislation youd have a dramatic effect
3928383 snuff out rising politicians who were building their careers on antigay policies before they achieve national influence
3928384 in 2000 he gave 300 000 in political donations which grew to 800 000 in 2002 5 million in 2004 and a staggering 15 million last year almost all of it to state and local campaigns
3928385 denver dallas los angeles malibu theres new york again san francisco i just cannot believe this
3928386 politicians think they can get away with ignoring what voters think on marriage unless that changes gay marriage activists are going to push blue state legislators to pass gay marriage whether the people in their state want it or not
3928387 its not just marriage that is at stake its absolutely everything
3928388 this has been an ongoing struggle that burns in our hearts
3928389 and now marriage is really on the brink and i dont know how to emphasize that more
3928390 fungsi dari pks bahwa partai politik harus menjadi sumber kepemimpinan nasional dan sumber ide ide besar yang membimbing menjadi besar
3928391 ciri zaman adalah ide ide besar harus ada narasi besarnya agar terus eksis dan pks sekarang punya narasi besar yang dituliskan di buku platform
3928392 dan buku platform ini adalah daftar mimpi dari pks yang caranya akan dijelaskan bila pks berkuasa
3928393 hal ini sangat berpengaruh dalam peningkatan kualitas ekonomi suatu bangsa
3928394 namun tidak ada partai yang mempunyai buku platform setebal dan sekomprehensif yang dimiliki oleh partai keadilan sejahtera
3928395 olehnya pks ke depan harus memperkuat karakter organiknya meraih pemilih dan mendidik mereka
3928396 partai adalah materi materi tanpa rohani hanya akan menjadi kekuasaan bahkan otoriterisme hingga opurtunisme
3928397 syariat islam merupakan ekspresi material mesti dipahami secara ruhaniyah makanya pks harus sudah menentukan pointer pointer materi yang mana yang harus dilaksanakan dan prosentasinya harus jelas
3928398 orang yang paling besar hukumannya di hari kiamat adalah orang yang mencoba membuat sesuatu seperti ciptaan allah
3928399 presiden susilo bambang yudhoyono sejak tahun 2005 justru mengajak mui untuk turut terlibat dalam pembuatan kebijakan kebijakan pemerintahannya ini menjadi sangat berbahaya karena mui dikuasai kalangan garis keras dan pemerintah maaf tidak cukup berani menghadapi mereka dan tidak cukup berani untuk menegakkan nilai nilai demokrasi dan toleransi yang selama ini dianut bangsa indonesia ini sangat mencemaskan masa depan indonesia
3928400 penanganan masalah ahmadiyah menunjukan bahwa kaum garis keras indonesia telah mencapai keberhasilan besar dalam melakukan lobi menebarkan pengaruh besar dan lamgsung terhadap pembuatan kebijakan kebijakan negara
3928401 yang lebih unik menurut icg sebetulnya dukungan politik masyarakat terhadap kelompok kelompok garis keras itu sebetulnya kecil yang membuat mereka tampak besar hanyalah karena bereka bersuara lantang masalahnya keleluasaan yang mereka peroleh dan akses lobi langsung terhadap pemerintah membuka jalan bagi mereka untuk meluaskan pengaruhnya di kalangan masyarakat luas
3928402 di kabinet mereka setuju bbm naik di luar ngomong nya lain sontoloyo
3928403 padahal dalam survei lsn pada januari 2008 pasangan sby jk masih bertengger di peringkat kelima waktu itu sebanyak 43 8 persen publik mengaku akan memilih sby jk jika pasangan ini berduet lagi dalam pilpres 2009
3928404 meskipun banyak tokoh yang ingin bertarung dalam pilpres 2009 tampaknya yang akan menjadi presiden dan wapres 2009 2014 tidak akan keluar dari keenam nama itu
3928405 kini semuanya terpulang kepada publik apakah masih akan memberi kesempatan kepada tokoh tokoh lama atau mencoba figur baru yang biasanya juga menjanjikan harapan baru
3928406 pasangan sby sultan semakin mantap di puncak klasemen sepuluh besar pasangan capres cawapres
3928407 saat ini saya konsentrasi ke muhammadiyah karena saya dipercaya memikul amanat hingga 2010 kalau ada tawaran capres saya akan konsultasi kepada muhammadiyah
3928408 kalau muhammadiyah menerimanya saya akan pertimbangkan dua hal yakni kemampuan saya dan kemungkinan menang kalau kemampuan mungkin saya masih berani bertarung dengan calon yang itu itu tapi kalau kemungkinan menang tentu harus jeli
3928409 tak perlu diragukan lagi secara historis kaum muslimin telah memberi pengaruh dalam evolusi masyarakat amerika beberapa abad sebelum christopher columbus menemukannya
3928410 columbus juga tahun bahwa muslim dari pantai barat afrika telah tinggal lebih dulu di karibia amerika tengah selatan dan utara
3928411 di amerika utara sekurangnya terdapat 565 nama suku perkampungan kota dan pegunungan yang akar katanya berasal dari bahasa arab
3928412 the british takeover of american foreign policy after jfk asia 1963 65
3928413 the world cannot exist half poor and half rich yet the gap between the developed and the less developed nations is year by year becoming greater rather than less there is an alternative to accepting todays world conflicts merely on a political level to explore and to understand the social and economic pressures that are the source of the conflicts and have their roots in a contrasting culture
3928414 numerous published accounts lend credence to that assumption in may 1958 however neither the fact nor the extent of such support was known to us in the embassy
3928415 u s pretensions to non interference in internal affairs of asian nations would have been completely discredited and the moral quality of our leadership so recently established in asia by our voluntary act in granting independence to the philippines would have been lost
3928416 another case of predelictions blinding us to facts of prejudices blocking judgment of the wish being father to the thought and unmovable objects preconceptions in the minds of the readers of my reports to washington
3928417 you arent worried about france and italys communist votes yet theirs is higher
3928418 we were worried about communism in these countries that is what the marshall plan was all about
3928419 if president kennedy means what he says in these speeches than i agree with him completely
3928420 aidit and his associates were confident of riding the democratic road to power
3928421 indonesias democracy is not liberal democracy indonesian democracy is not the democracy of the world of montaigne or voltaire indonesian democracy is not la america indonesias democracy is not the soviet no indonesias democracy is the democracy which is implanted in the breasts of the indonesian peoples democracy is only a means it is not an end the end is a just and prosperous society
3928422 he was ready to fight for peoples freedom anywhere at any time he was highly suspicious of british motivation
3928423 wanted to know whether there was a possibility of a breakup of indonesia owing to the antagonism between sumatra and java
3928424 what in your opinion would happen if sukarno were no longer on stage
3928425 was quite aware as i was that the british were a key factor in determining the tunkus position
3928426 major setback in our efforts to build a good will bridge
3928427 part of the trouble was that the british and malaysia had no intention of supplying sukarno with an easy solution they felt they had this troublemaking asian leader on the run
3928428 g30s the abbreviation for the sept 30 1965 coup attempt which sparked the bloody reaction is nothing but the metamorphosis of protracted british opposition to sukarnos confrontation policy until now generally the suspicion is rather one sided towards the americans the cia while in fact british intelligence played a substantial role in the g30s conspiracy
3928429 in the long term effective support for dissident movements in indonesia may be counteproductive in that it might impair the capacity of the army to resist the pki
3928430 make it clear to the indonesian army that any support for dissidents is no more than a tactical response to confrontation
3928431 43 beginning in august 1964 the british established secret contacts with the man in charge of the military side of indonesias konfrontasi general suharto who deployed his intelligence chief col
3928432 that the g30s kidnapped generals who were faithful to sukarno indicates that the wishes of sir andrew gilchrist then british ambassador to indonesia were carried out
3928433 i have never concealed from you my belief that a little shooting in indonesia would be an essential preliminary to effective change
3928434 the indonesian believes deeply in god his occult trappings are carried along with him as baggage which he thinks helps him communicate with the infinite
3928435 my experiences in indonesia left me somewhat shaken in my disbelief in the occult
3928436 javanese exorcism ritual that involved several of us on the embassy staff preceded by chanting officiants carrying incense sticks parading through the new building
3928437 just as the improving internal situation in indonesia seemed to justify undramatic albeit hopeful expectations that u s indonesian tensions would be eased the boom was lowered
3928438 i have to address a few words to the government of the united states
3928439 on the part of indonesia the desire to be friends with the u s is already very clear
3928440 with a heavy heart i have to state that the johnson tunku joint statement is really too much it really exceeds all bounds
3928441 my closest colleague was the british ambassador sir andrew gilchrist and later his successor horace phillip who lived across the street from our residence
3928442 a human being of great warmth and magnetism a leader of vision who stuck by his precepts of unity in which he had always believed even though this meant pulling the pillars of his temple down upon his head
3928443 lost himself in self glorification forgetting that the truly great are humble and in so doing betrayed his people
3928444 a vainglorious man a dangerous man to be sure but not a very serious man
3928445 fighting for the establishment of a national and democratic economy
3928446 is embodied in the progressive attitude and policy of president sukarno
3928447 i am impatient i can no longer wait perhaps the farmers will also box the ears of those officials who are moving too slowly
3928448 muslim groups and others except communists and their stooges are lined up behind army
3928449 now or never if sukarno and his greasy civilian cohorts get back into the saddle it will be a change for the worse we are dealing with such an odd devious contradictory mess like the indonesian mind
3928450 working hard at destroying pki and i for one have increasing respect for its determination and organization in carrying out this crucial assignment
3928451 two officers of pemuda pantjasila a muslim youth group told consulate officers that their organization intends to kill every pki member they can catch much indiscriminate killing is taking place attitude pemuda pantjasila leaders can only be described as bloodthirsty something like a real reign of terror against pki is taking place the terror is not repeat not discriminating very carefully between pki leaders and ordinary pki members with no ideological bond to the party
3928452 the bloodbath can be attributed to the fact that communism with its atheism and talk of class warfare was abhorrent to the way of life of rural indonesians especially in java and bali
3928453 i have witnessed what occurs when reason is replaced by fear and suspicion when decisions are based on prejudice rumor and propaganda
3928454 today we are faced with the pre eminent fact that if civilization is to survive we must cultivate the science of human relationships the ability of all people of all lands to live together and work together in the same world at peace
3928455 history is likely to regard the period from 1946 to about 1970 as the golden age of the american foreign service
3928456 we have spoken out against inhuman slaughter perpetrated by the nazis and the communists but will we speak out also against the inhuman slaughter in indonesia where over 100 000 alleged communists have not been perpetrators but victims

3928462 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3928463 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3928464 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about u s policy
3928465 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am am i going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is

3928474 those who are responsible for the security of the games feel very frustrated because we are in an asymmetric battle with the enemy and who can understand this situation better than the israelis
3928475 we are taking into account the possibility that the group has agents who were brought secretly into beijing
3928476 of course if the chinese security forces had information about them they would have arrested them immediately assessments and scenarios were prepared that there may be attempts to attack public places in the capital such as buses hotels railway stations and the subway but it is quite clear to me that the olympic village is properly secured and very hard to infiltrate

3928483 the new bridge type is a construction that projects several years into the future but the study shows that it would be technologically possible to build this bridge today if the concept is further elaborated
3928484 however at present the economic conditions are constrained by the major investments that would be needed to start production and by the high prices for fiber composite materials
3928485 theres a used car business out there that knows very well when it is selling a car to an individual that that individual will not likely be able to hold on to their car for the duration of their loan payment and so therefore theyll return the car after a few months into the duration of the loan but thats ok with them because theyve charged a high enough interest to cover the costs associated with that car being returned before the end of the loan in other words byrider has sold a car made a profit on the loan and gotten the car back whats more buisinessweek would report that nearly half of byriders albuquerque car sales dont result in a final payoff

3928572 its not only the south ossetians who are back in the ussr this morning
3928573 other georgians countries in russias near abroad from the caucasus to the baltic national minorities such as the chechens the west and even russians themselves now have to deal with a country and political leadership that bear an eerie similarity to soviet models they are authoritarian militaristic greedy and not overly concerned about where their borders end
3928574 russian tanks crossed into georgia proper might he dismember the country still further and block the one pipeline that brings central asian energy to the west without going through russian territory and if so will the west let him get away with it
3928575 moscow apparently calculates that its brute seizure of another countrys territory can be disguised as a peacekeeping operation to prevent genocide and ethnic cleansing by the georgians
3928576 communism might have worked if it hadnt been tried in russia first

3928582 this is a way to fast track people into the system
3928583 we will be giving them the basics and then they can go from there
3928584 even if they decide the red cross isnt for them they will still know what it is that we do
3928585 hopefully they will go back into the community and tell their neighbors and their churches were about empowering communities to respond to disasters its neighbors helping neighbors
3928586 sunglasses and eyewear are essential accessories to make a statement on and off the runway and i am really excited to give them a galliano twist
3928587 i cant wait to begin a new vision on vision
3928588 its very embarrassing when you meet like a russian prostitute and she says shes a supermodel
3928589 i would never refer to myself as a supermodel it sounds silly it sounds like we change into our capes in a telephone booth
3928590 we believe our estimate of 3 8 million iphones sold in apples september quarter is very conservative
3928591 furthermore we believe that initial demand overseas is very strong and will get much stronger we estimate at least 8 3 million iphones could be sold in the december quarter
3928592 its a difficult position im in because i know edwin is number one
3928593 but every day im ready for training and i approach every game ready to play its important to me to play as many games as i can
3928594 it was a good exam for me over christmas and i think i did quite okay i certainly did my best and i tried to help the team win our games
3928595 every single game i play for united is a step forward
3928596 i feel more comfortable and confident each time i play and thats what a goalkeeper needs the champions league experience has been very good too so i think im on the way up
3928597 ill do everything i can to push edwin for the jersey and i think that helps both of us we have a good relationship and theres healthy competition on the training field
3928598 i have received offers from england portugal and brazil i have become accustomed to winning trophies with brazil and would like to do the same at club level
3928599 trying to extend his contract is a priority for us
3928600 if i can stay in the united team and continue to play well then hopefully i can get an england call up
3928601 danny is still only young and has another year at this level hes a very talented player and all the other players respond to that
3928602 federico is a very good technical player hes a good finisher makes good decisions and some very clever runs in some ways he has a style like dimitar berbatov his touch is very good
3928603 he understands what were after and he has fitted in well with the culture of the club
3928604 federico and danny are on a really good wavelength that is what you want good partnerships when you see them in training and you look at the likes of rooney and tevez and the way they link up those two lads are capable of doing similar sorts of combinations
3928605 i am still happy playing for manchester united and i am not thinking of going elsewhere
3928606 i never heard anything about birmingham being interested i just know i want to be here for a long time
3928607 my only focus is on being ready when the manager needs me and being able to perform for the club when asked
3928608 but it has been down to the form of the midfield fair play to anderson when paul scholes got injured he came in and has great the manager has stuck by him which is what he does when you perform well
3928609 we will see how things pan out at the end of the season in terms of games played and what you have contributed to the squad but i am not thinking about that just now im looking short term and id like to win a few trophies and hopefully go a few steps further than last year
3928610 we wondered at the start of last season whether he could match last seasons tally of 23 you had to say why not
3928611 i expected him to score more this season because he works so hard thats why there were no bets this season all bets are off with ronaldo
3928612 his first hat trick was always coming hes been close on a number of occasions but today he capped a really fine display with the hat trick were all delighted for him
3928613 our performance last week at aston villa in the cup was carved out of a magnificent defensive display
3928614 it gave us the energy to go and win the game in the last 20 minutes it was the same against newcastle
3928615 weve lost three games away from home but the reason were top of the league is because our home form has been so good
3928616 its a hard league you saw the results with arsenal and liverpool drawing teams are taking points off one another
3928617 we expected it to be tough teams well below the top four are spending a lot of money on their squads there is a drive for teams to improve themselves and stay in the premier league the points total could be lower this year
3928618 hey im being highly exploited and i dont like this
3928619 just look at my rate of profit its very very low
3928620 oh yeah i see youre not making much out of this are you so poor you ill work even harder you know
3928621 hey why the fuck wasnt i paid for last thursday
3928622 why the fuck arent you letting me get overtime and not allowing me to double shift for the day

3928633 shows good touch around the basket finishes with a lot of creativity doesnt deal well with contact but can usually avoid it goes to the line at an average pace something he should definitely work on very good ball handler and passer even if hes more of a scorer than a facilitator will break his man down off the dribble and drop the ball off to the open man when the defense collapses

3928636 ill just ask mahela jayawardene if he will lend mendis for a couple of practice sessions if not then
3928637 but seriously we will have to deal with it in a personal way we can watch 1000 videos of what he does but it is up to the individual to play him on the turf it depends on your frame of mind
3928638 its not just his contribution with bat and the ball but he comes up with brilliant suggestions and advice on the field the impact he has in the dressing room is great
3928639 it is always a different game and we have different game plans for handling india
3928640 its a young side and we are grooming a young group of guys to take over we are looking to the little things well as individuals thats been our emphasis and i think thats what has contributed to our improvement over that period
3928641 murali has got the support he requires and also there is support for chaminda vaas we have the likes of lasith malinga and dilhara fernando for us its always a team and it does not matter what ajantha mendis does
3928642 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3928643 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3928644 francois thank you very much for what you have done for our country

3928667 there are tutoring programs at every school in orange county
3928668 everyone can be a part of a kids life through mentor programs and through tutoring
3928669 the teachers would not have to worry as much about teaching to the test day after day
3928670 it would really embarrass some of these kids if their classmates knew what was going on
3928671 its not the students fault but many of them are so self conscious and afraid of how their friends would respond
3928672 i can not imagine starting off my career as an elementary school teacher without having had this kind of experience
3928673 it has really been a challenge to prepare a curriculum and include all of the required material
3928674 it would have been really hard to do it on my own without the help of the teacher i work with
3928675 it just puts tremendous pressure on us as teachers to teach to the test
3928676 its a real struggle to make classes fun for the students when so much rides on their test grades at the end of the year
3928677 its just unfortunate that our freedom to teach is limited
3928678 we have to spend our time trying to squeeze in material instead of thinking of more creative ways to present it
3928679 one of the most important things about the backpacks is that we give them to the children without everyone else noticing
3928680 the kids dont want all the other kids to know whats in those bags
3928681 its a great chance to get some personal things done and be able to really focus on the students when theyre in class
3928682 i think its important for the kids to see us as more than just lecturers
3928683 eating lunch with them lets us get to know them outside of the classroom

3928687 robertson said it could be another six months before the city owns the property because of significant delays in trying to work out an appropriate payment method
3928688 member don weathers said he was concerned that if the school were annexed it could later have a property tax imposed if mt juliet voted to put one in place
3928689 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3928690 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3928691 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3928692 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3928693 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3928694 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3928695 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3928696 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3928697 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3928698 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3928699 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3928700 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3928701 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3928702 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3928703 theres a big difference between market research and market expertise
3928704 lots of communities look good on paper but it takes an understanding of local tastes needs and lifestyles to know which ones will truly succeed
3928705 since all of our communities are within a few minutes drive of our corporate offices the leadership team has a much better understanding of how our products are selling and what our customers think about their homes
3928706 if theres any problem with a design or feature we can correct it immediately to ensure that our customers remain satisfied and if one design is particularly successful we can find out why and develop new designs that will appeal to our clients for the same reasons
3928707 the key is to make sure we do it right the first time
3928708 a little extra work during the construction stage means less work for us in the long run and less daily maintenance for our customers after they move in most of our leadership team has worked with the national firms so we understand where their processes fall short we spent a lot of time on product development making sure our designs and our features picked up where the others guys left off
3928709 obviously when you work for a company youre invested in its success
3928710 but since we live here were also invested in the success of the community and the city that makes a big difference in the way a company operates
3928711 im a ugly man that humps animals and is a gigolo in europe get your tickets now seriously though how many crap movies is this guy going to make anyway whats even worse is now tim allen is a guy who acts like a dog in his upcoming movies hollywood is running out of ideas arent they
3928712 for sheer love of humanity one occasionally embraces some random person because one cannot embrace everyone but this is the one thing one must not let the random person know
3928713 i had a dream the other night that you asked me to call you and when i did youre wife answered the phone she was pretty pissed off what gives
3928714 there is a lack of funding for community groups all over and like many other groups this has affected us
3928715 obviously we dont want to cut down the number of days as we provide a service but there was nothing we could do when the funding was reduced
3928716 the staff and me included have all lost their own working hours because of this
3928717 we want to keep on providing the quality childcare we have always done but unfortunately the provision has had to be reduced
3928718 i dont get paid nearly enough to put up with all of your shit
3928719 should not allow leaflets posters etc to be displayed in board premises or be distributed to the public from board premises
3928720 library staff should not engage in any campaign against board policy
3928721 this is a clear conflict of interest obviously union members may in their own time participate in union activity if they desire
3928722 they arent telling anybody anything and this document was presented to staff as a done deal we are one hundred per cent behind staff and against anyone losing their jobs
3928723 we will do everything in our power to prevent the closures of libraries in this city
3928724 most of these libraries are in areas of great deprivation and need they talk about building super libraries but what about the social and community aspect of local facilities they represent a life line to many young and old alike
3928725 fully support the right of all of its staff to take part in union activity and has a positive working relationship with nipsa and other unions
3928726 each of the clubs have two representatives on the committee and there is a wide range of dialogue and interaction on all issues
3928727 this is a responsible and commendable community response to the problems that are being faced in the local area
3928728 the pubs and clubs should be congratulated for their efforts they are providing employment and at the same time trying to protect decent and law abiding people from anti social behaviour elements that are terrorising this community
3928729 there has been a case when someones name was being considered wrongly they were able to put their case forward and that was addressed we havent got everything right yet but were working on it
3928730 at the end of it you get a badge and youll soon find everyone will need a badge its going to be like a psv you wont be able to work without one
3928731 i met with phil mctaggart and i explained the necessity of having properly trained people on the doors throughout north belfast and they thought it only proper that this sort of course was delivered to staff working here
3928732 in the name of all competitors i promise that we shall take part in these olympic games respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams
3928733 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well

3928742 there has been a proliferation of flags in lisburn this year
3928743 these flags are provocative and they raise sectarian tensions at a time of the year when we should be trying to bring about a peaceful summer free from sectarian harassment
3928744 it is also up to unionist politicians in lisburn to use their influence to help remove flags which are displayed provocatively
3928745 in particular the mp jeffrey donaldson should be calling for the removal of flags which his catholic constituents see as threatening
3928746 all of us should all be working for an environment where people can live free from any threats
3928747 the twelfth of july was almost three weeks ago but theyll leave the flags up for months

3928758 addictive systems have been properly described as societies that are either preparing for war or recovering from war such societies elevate the values of destruction and violence over values of nurturing and peace we have only to look at what our society spends on defense to see where its values lie since the amount of money this society spends on something is a measure of its worth to that society the amount spent on weapons every minute could feed 2 thousand mal nourished children for a year while the price o one military tank could provide classrooms for thirty thousand students

3928795 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights
3928796 besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of cuba the united states finds itself inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways both vexatious and costly many cubans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press by public meetings by the purchase and shipment of arms by the raising of funds and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prosecutions some of them though cubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the united states a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this government and not unnaturally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin
3928797 isnt it convenient that russia has given south ossetians passports and then claim that they are protecting
3928798 russia has expanded the conflict with air strikes against targets in georgia
3928799 if government tell you any number about something 1 3 of that number a lie
3928800 should interfere as the present peacemaker and it is able to do it
3928801 the purpose of the georgian political elite today is ethnic cleaning they wish to clear territory of south ossetia from the osset than and armed forces of georgia
3928802 command of the russian peacemakers confirms that purposeful fire on destruction in a place of a disposition of peacemakers in tskhinvali
3928803 the georgian management has untied dirty adventure the blood spilled in south ossetia will be on conscience of these people and their environments we in insult shall not give the peacemakers and citizens of the russian federation
3928804 to live in structure of the fascist state georgia it is not obviously possible we ask legal legal aid in a recognition of independence of republic south ossetia
3928805 i saw how the georgian tank has moved the grandmother with 2 grandsons

3928807 1984 where two and two makes five war is peace and ignorance is strength read that book i advise you my personal opinion is that ignorance is bliss for all parties concerned
3928808 there is no solution to this crisis which does not involve stopping russia and punishing it for its invasion of georgia
3928809 georgia has had nothing to do with these territories for 15 years
3928810 forcing people with military aggression into a state that they dont want to be part of
3928811 every move in a war costs money much money killing civilians is worth nothing
3928812 abkhaz and osetians are already part of georgia says every country and federation of countries on earth
3928813 dont shame the chinese its very important for them not to lose face
3928814 tibet has been part of china for hundreds of years
3928815 it is barbaric to come to someones house and start a fight
3928816 chinese government is now promoting harmony among people all over the world
3928817 many happy europeans and americans enjoying their stay in china
3928818 hatred and revenge became the order of the day when the olympic torch had its run in the democratic countries
3928819 you are right that tibetans in exile are not singular in their views but the overall majority have faith in the dalai lama as a religious and political leader
3928820 the feelings of the chinese have been hurt by western criticism
3928821 why do you insist that the american or british system is superior to the chinese system and that if china does not go the way of the west then it must be condemned
3928822 china will never insist that other countries adopt its system
3928823 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
3928824 do you think a new haiti is possible and are you prepared to do what it takes to get it to a point where it produces 300 000 potential olympians a year rather than 300 000 child slaves

3928835 global voices has a translation of an excellent open letter to google by osamu higuchi explaining that street view is too invasive for japanese traditional values when used in

3928837 wow i bet a lot of people dont like it
3928838 if all the information and knowledge scattered all over the world on the web could be organized in an orderly way so that anybody could access it whenever they needed to then the world would undergo a major change
3928839 there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening
3928840 while there are many constants across the globe and being uncomfortable about streetview may well be one of them i would also add that people can arrive to the same conclusion through different paths in this case object to streetview for different reasons
3928841 i just wanted to say that japanese life space is in a different scale especially when compared with american
3928842 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
3928843 do you think a new haiti is possible and are you prepared to do what it takes to get it to a point where it produces 300 000 potential olympians a year rather than 300 000 child slaves

3928847 are not to be treated as substitutes for discovery processes to uncover evidence and that they may not be applied to controverted legal issues lying at the heart of the case
3928848 presupposes that the party proceeding under it knows the facts
3928849 compound complex and vague requests for admission are prone to objection
3928850 requests for admissions of law which are related to the facts of the case are considered to be inappropriate

3928987 ik weet niet waar ik moet beginnen mijn eerste reactie is dat ik het zo erg vind dat ik er niet voor je was gedurende die ondraaglijke tijd zelfs nu dat je me in detail vertelt hoe het was kan ik me niet voorstellen waar je doorheen bent gegaan maar ik ben blij dat ik je weer gevonden heb
3928988 aha dan mag jij dit doen want als je het zegt van een ander ben je zelf de pineut
3928989 ik mag niet mee ze zeggen dat ik een man ben
3928990 wir taggen uns einfach mal mit allen genres die wir so kennen dann werden wir auch gefunden
3928991 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3928992 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3928993 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3928994 die eerste prijs ook dat is mooi als je dat mee kan maken terwijl je koning bent jij mag die prijs dan aanpakken en het artikel in de krant met foto was daarna ook erg leuk
3928995 dat is ook leuk om mee te maken met de babys op de foto het hoort er allemaal bij
3928996 die mensen zitten er toch op te kijken of je langs komt en vinden het ook altijd erg attent en leuk ook als mensen in het ziekenhuis liggen het is toch altijd mooi als je dan een bezoek brengt dat het gewaardeerd wordt dat geeft voldoening
3928997 de optrekdag is toch d jaarlijkse traditionele dag van de rooi skut op deze dag wordt ook de nieuwe deken gekozen het is een drukke doch leuke dag die s morgens vroeg al begint met een gildemis in de kerk daarna wordt er gevendeld voor de pastoor is er koffie wordt de nieuwe deken thuis opgehaald en uiteindelijk is er een receptie met aansluitende feestavond het is en blijft toch een speciale dag voor het gilde en het is leuk om mee te maken als koning
3928998 het is nooit leuk als een gildebroeder overlijdt en je als koningspaar de begrafenis bij dient te wonen maar ook dat is je plicht ook dat hoort erbij
3928999 het is toch je neef die overlijdt en dan dien je op te draven in de rol van koning en gemaal voor ons vader ook was het een zoon van zijn broer als koning en gemaal sta je op dat moment toch overal voorop terwijl deze persoon dichter bij je staat dan bij al die andere begrafenissen dat is erg raar om mee te maken toon heeft mij ook diverse malen bijgestaan als gemaal toen ons pap niet kon dus dat maakt het ook extra emotioneel
3929000 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3929001 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3929002 want jezus komt terug hoor en hij komt op een wolk en komt ons dan op halen en dan zie jij je vader

3929005 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3929006 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3929007 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3929008 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3929009 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3929010 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3929011 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3929012 our challenge from day one has been to shape our roster in a way that our fans will see a team that is competitive that plays hard every night and has a chance to win
3929013 we feel this trade continues to move us toward that goal for this season and beyond
3929014 please l l lady calm down have you got a gun
3929015 i started reading your blog i was appalled at you language and hearing how you made a fool of yourself so sad you should step back and look at your self and your behaver
3929016 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3929017 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3929018 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3929019 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3929020 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3929021 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3929022 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3929023 weve been watching the greater antilles bahamas system and another system in the eastern atlantic for about three days now
3929024 the greater bahamas antilles system was more interestingsince it had more potential to plow into the oil rich gulf of mexico sometime next week which would of course be catastrophic
3929025 our models show the cape canary system will cross the 30th parallel north of the equator at about 1 000 miles an hour no wait a minute about 1 000 miles east of the bermuda triangle it wont be going that fast that would be like a category 99 hurricane heh heh heh but anyway it may very well then swing about with roar and whoosh of spray over the next five days once that happens it could threaten the gulf of mexico and cause catastrophic disruption in oil production
3929026 e ent o morrer por morrer que seja a rir
3929027 our study found that combat deployment in support of the wars in iraq and afghanistan was significantly associated with new onset heavy weekly drinking binge drinking and other alcohol related problems among reserve guard and younger personnel after return from deployment
3929028 because alcohol use may serve as a coping mechanism after traumatic events it is plausible that deployment is associated with increased rates of alcohol consumption or problem drinking
3929029 i think this study is probably very accurate as part of the re entry process people will turn to coping mechanisms that are easily accessible and alcohol is easily available socially acceptable and quite effective for short term stress relief
3929030 surround yourself with people you can talk to and establish a support system that isnt tied to a bar
3929031 have a huge effect and it could lead people to treatment on their own
3929032 would be a real and clear indication that they valued and respected the contribution of these people
3929033 i was a little surprised at first when hasbro filed the lawsuit
3929034 i soon realized that it was inevitable since scrabulous was effectively a 100 percent knock off of scrabble but that didnt make it any less irritating i was really hoping that hasbro would settle for just assuming ownership of the scrabulous application
3929035 i played it all the time at work while simulataneously enhancing my vocabulary

3929037 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3929038 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3929039 tenemos que prepararnos muy bien y tenemos que mejorar cosas
3929040 en el papel s es favorito pero eso no dice nada todos los partidos que nos van a jugar van a ser complicados y dif ciles aunque parezca que ju rez indios es el d bil para nosotros no tenemos que prepararnos muy bien y tenemos que mejorar cosas que no estamos haciendo
3929041 eso siempre ha sido importante desde el primer partido hasta ste que vamos a jugar contra ju rez indios creo que esa es la filosof a que estamos buscando nuestra primera victoria que nos va a dar un reforzamiento de las cosas que estamos haciendo bien en estos partidos en los que desafortunadamente no hemos conseguido ese triunfo
3929042 va muy bien daniel ludue a christian ben tez si sigue as probablemente inicie el domingo y si no me lo llevo a la banca en el caso ludue a voy a platicar con los doctores l de adelant a los procesos de la rehabilitaci n va muy bien pero no me quiero confiar no quiero que se vuelva a resentir si no est para el siguiente partido probablemente est para el partido ante chivas
3929043 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3929044 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3929045 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3929046 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team

3929048 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3929049 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3929050 by the time any user was notified that facebook was at a minimum an observing party to the transaction and that facebook was asking for an approval to publicly broadcast identifying information regarding the event personally identifying information had already been communicated to facebook
3929051 thus non facebook persons who utilized the facebook beacon activated affiliate websites were not told that their transaction and indeed every transaction they engaged in upon the website was being communicated to a third party facebook with whom they had no relationship whatsoever
3929052 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
3929053 this is the right thing for me this feels right
3929054 what would my friends think what would my readers think i am a horrible person
3929055 me siento muy contento y agradecido como siempre orgulloso de poder estar en un partido como ste que es rumbo al mundial y de estar en una lista que es tan complicada porque viene gente que est en un buen momento que est haciendo las cosas muy bien y que la mayor a son defensores y ocupar un lugar ah fue muy dif cil ahora hay que disfrutar tratar de trabajar bien con chivas y despu s pensaremos en lo que ser honduras
3929056 poco a poco se va complicando porque son gente que por algo est n en el extranjero ahora que tiene m s participaci n pues juega en una liga m s grande y tiene m s continuidad y dentro de todo tambi n est h ctor moreno que no fue convocado pero tambi n es buen defensa pero me han dicho que los hechos hablan por s mismo y eso me ha dado la oportunidad de seguir en la selecci n
3929057 habr rotaciones sobre todo en el medio campo no tenemos ni titulares ni sustitutos salvo jens lehmann todav a no hay ning n jugador seguro
3929058 en la defensa jugar n ricardo osorio matthieu delpierre serdar tasci y ludovic magnin jan simak y sami khedira ocupar n las posiciones del capit n thomas hitzlsperger y p vel pardo en la alineaci n inicial
3929059 yildiray bast rk martin lanig mario g mez y ciprian marica tambi n estar n desde el principio
3929060 somos favoritos tenemos partido en casa y si podemos utilizar todos nuestros recursos entonces nos clasificaremos para la copa uefa
3929061 kemenangan ini santgat penting tapi kami harus tetap fokus tim ini menghancurkan celtic 5 0 kami harus mengingat itu
3929062 hasil yang sangat krusial di saat kami kembali merasakan panasnya persaingan liga champions para pemain bermain bagus
3929063 kami baru setengah jalan kepastian baru diperoleh di slovakia sana
3929064 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3929065 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3929066 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3929067 i left the hotel and the guard was like wont you please just stay here but i had to go and see im insatiably curious i saw the smoke and fire and walked towards it
3929068 i fare better on the road than at home i train better i eat better i think better i suffer less depression after five or six days home i itch to get back into the world
3929069 this is my office and home ive been living like this since 1981
3929070 fiction is my first love but since bush i feel guilty reading it
3929071 they ask why are you so friendly what do they want me to do hit them i have to explain that im not the same way on stage as at the dentists
3929072 for the purpose of building public lavatories in the streets of some of the largest cities in the world
3929073 i dont care if gold hits 10 000 an ounce
3929074 in a house i bought for a dollar and fixed up
3929075 imagine the area bordered by main best jefferson and ferry thats a roughly 50 block area that has gone through so much change and stress this past half century and the stadium was right in the middle of it
3929076 back in the day there was a seven block stretch of masten avenue connecting the old rockpile war memorial stadium to offermann stadium there were stores back then there were taverns and churches and shops when both stadiums had events like september when football and baseball overlapped or there were playoff games these streets were bustling it was electric the neighborhood was jammed with activity now there is no economy there not a single business or establishment the stadium would have anchored that economy although having the school there does somewhat fill that void
3929077 i remember when the stadium first opened up there was always a ball field on that land but now they built a grand grandstand it was so big and so beautiful and people came they came from all over just to see the green grass and that big scoreboard it was the prettiest sight youd ever want to see
3929078 we would grab a great corner and catch the fans as they came off the trolley five cents for a scorecard and for ten cents an apple and a pear i was just a little kid but the fans thought i was adorable
3929079 and i remember all the great players ollie tucker frank pytlak whose family lived right here in buffalo you know and of course the best of them all ollie carnegie i wish you could see the many ways how people would manage to see the game ticket money was hard to come by during the depression but everyone wanted to see their heroes
3929080 when i first moved here an older neighbor invited me to sit with her and pulled out a frayed scrapbook with old pictures from the neighborhood
3929081 i remember it like it was yesterday i was in high school and everyone wanted to be there and by the time school let out you could not move in the streets thats how packed it was the whole city turned out to see the bisons
3929082 grown men were weeping in the streets and hugging each other i can tell you that there was such a celebration which went all night long mayor charles roesch declared a civic holiday and there was a parade through the neighborhood
3929083 understand that this was such a bad time for families there were no jobs people were losing their homes and some going to bed hungry at night but this was baseball baseball was magical and the bisons winning like they did brought such joy to people that year at a time when people needed some joy
3929084 last fall we went to the historical society and said give us everything you got on offermann stadium
3929085 in all they had about 25 30 pictures most that we could use and an aerial shot
3929086 we wrote out a list of every feature every discernable part of the building
3929087 they came up with an initial clay model and the base its not perfect and we went back and forth and added detail we called on people such as paul offermann jr who assisted us greatly he had a few pictures and a map of the ballpark he was big on the coloring
3929088 the posts look like oil derricks and we matched the outside wall colors nicely they were beige and brown with green shutters
3929089 i come from niagara falls and the bisons once played at sal maglie stadium
3929090 a great era for buffalo baseball at war memorial stadium
3929091 kids grow up and then bring their kids to the ballpark the team and the stadiums are what binds western new yorkers and the generations together
3929092 but ive heard the stories of the good old days how kids used to sneak in look over the fence posts the fans sitting on the rooftops then there was luke easter who really made that stadium what it is one could say it was the building that luke built how fun it is to compare now to 50 years ago how would luke easter fare against pitcher aaron laffey today thats what makes all this so neat
3929093 get there early if you want your own offermann replica last years war memorial stadium replica line stretched all the way down to exchange street
3929094 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3929095 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3929096 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3929097 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3929098 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3929099 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3929100 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her

3929102 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3929103 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3929104 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3929105 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3929106 ur the computer says sociology would be in the social science section thats over here
3929107 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
3929108 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
3929109 its my duty to make sure it gets done properly
3929110 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3929111 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3929112 at this stage we do not consider funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors

3929123 open source software developers are very pragmatic and focused on solving problems scientists are focused on problems too but their priority is often publication and that can sometimes come in the way of openness and sharing the ideals of science are of course openness sharing and no restrictions on the free flow of knowledge but in practice that doesnt happen much at all some scientists however are pushing back and many say they need to rethink how they conduct science
3929124 but there are some very innovative licensing schemes and innovative ways by which you can allow others to peek into your process and not give up the entire keys to the kingdom
3929125 nobody believes that a scientists only contribution is from the papers he or she publishes
3929126 people understand that a good scientist also gives talks at conferences shares ideas takes a leadership role in the community its just that publications were always the one thing you could measure now however as more of this informal communication goes online that will get easier to measure too
3929127 the typical legal advice is do not disclose your ideas before you file
3929128 when we publish things by and large weve gone through a very long process of drafting a paper and getting it peer reviewed every word is carefully chosen because its going to stay there for all time no one wants to read
3929129 i come across a lot of parents trying to live out their own ambitions through their children
3929130 it particularly happens in the professions dentistry medicine or law we have fathers coming along heavy handed threatening legal action if we dont let their child in but if a person has not met the terms of an offer the university is not obliged to give them a place
3929131 you cannot plan children you dont necessarily get what you want you didnt expect this its a blow at some level you feel you havent got the results you invested in but its only going to be worse if you criticise them for it
3929132 so buy them a present or take them out because they tried really hard make light of it try and buoy them up then put your energy into helping the kids get a university place
3929133 they can say sell yourself to me then offer ways for them to phrase it better for instance getting them to start by talking about their best result first will help them emphasise the positive during the conversation
3929134 one parent commented to me that essex university is a hotbed of red revolutionaries based on his experiences in the 1960s i dont think anywhere nowadays is a hotbed of red revolutionaries
3929135 everyone has been rejected no matter how good they are
3929136 life is full of these moments its only in childhood we get everything we want
3929137 not functioning not eating not having a routine these are the roads to depression
3929138 being fed watered and exercised is very important for teenagers
3929139 if you start getting obsessed about your childs results it might be time to step back and take a look at your own life
3929140 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
3929141 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently

3929175 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
3929176 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
3929177 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park
3929178 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
3929179 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
3929180 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees
3929181 we are working as quickly and as safely as we can to get the unit working but first we need to investigate just what happened we are doing that at this time and as soon as we figure it out and repair whatever needs to be repaired well get that unit producing gas again
3929182 we have dedicated people working to contact alternative suppliers to get more product from elsewhere were stretching out traditional supply boundaries to get more gas in from other areas both in canada and offshore in short we know this stuff is important to people and were doing our best to minimize the situation

3929190 weve been there before and i anticipate that itll go down to the deadline
3929191 he had a great summer we knew he wanted to play there this summer with the midland team so we kind of respected his wishes weve seen him play all summer multiple scouts see him at different times and hes played well
3929192 hes an impact bat he potentially could play a gold glove defense at first base and potentially could be a middle of the order production bat
3929193 we did a lot of work prior to the draft with the player and his family and also his advisor
3929194 we have a pretty good understanding of what his expectations are and i dont where the market is going to go here in the last week but were preparing to make a strong run at signing eric we feel like hes a great person and a great talent and we expect to get him in a royal uniform but well see
3929195 there have been flashes but we need more than flashes we need to see consistency and we need to see improvement i trust there is a foundation of talent at the big league and minor league levels but we still have a lot of work to do to get over the hump
3929196 major league teams cant do what we did last night im not overreacting after one start but all season long the pitching has not been consistent we knew coming into the year we were going to depend on young pitching and give them every opportunity unfortunately the negative outings outweigh the positive outings we have to get the equation pointed in the other direction
3929197 we had a scout there who said he was very good
3929198 wed like to see him at least one more time and make sure he can repeat it and come back strong but thats what it looked like when we traded for him his fastball and curveball were very good
3929199 i think theres a good chance to get him ready for that
3929200 i want him to pitch again he has a chance to be one of our best five but we need him to pitch and get better
3929201 his intentions were good but it wasnt the right one he just wanted to move the guy but he didnt understand that the best way for him to help the club was to swing the bat
3929202 we wanted to make sure that it doesnt happen again that he knows all the reasons behind it and that he doesnt take it personal we are trying to teach not only him but every one on how to play the game right he took it very well
3929203 hes having a great year this year its one of those things where you never know how good hes going to be until he gets a chance to play every day
3929204 i dont want to get into it but were still a bit apart
3929205 were working and trying to get it done were hopeful well get him out there
3929206 hopefully some other guys might sign and that could help us
3929207 its getting close to the deadline and agents are taking the dance until friday well see who blinks
3929208 i cant say i know for sure well sign him if we dont well have two first round picks next year obviously our priority is to sign
3929209 we are extraordinarily interested in signing pedro alvarez but were not going to give all that money to a player who has yet to take a swing in professional baseball
3929210 instead of throwing all that money at one player that money can be more efficiently used
3929211 given the discussions with his representative the thought is that the best deal is going to come in those final minutes before the deadline

3929235 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
3929236 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3929237 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms with such a shocking and senseless attack

3929242 i will re state what i have previously stated on one point i learned of the affair only a few weeks ago and had previously presumed that the tabloid stuff was all bogus

3929257 tsvangirai is niet bijzonder wij gaan gewoon regeren met mutambara als premier
3929258 we gaan de geschiedenis van verdeel en heers door regeringspartij zanu pf niet herhalen
3929259 het zou politieke zelfmoord zijn als mutambara zijn actie zou doorzetten
3929260 pas in de laatste seconden van die partij had ik door dat het echt heel moeilijk zou worden toen ik wist dat het voorbij was heb ik even gehuild ik was er klaar voor om nog vier partijen te knallen om nog vol voor het brons te gaan ik voel me beter dan ooit ben misschien nog wel fitter dan vier jaar geleden in athene maar het is voorbij de vorm die ik nu heb zal ik nooit meer hebben nu baal ik dat deze dag voorbij is maar het is mooi geweest ik ben klaar met het judo
3929261 hij was echt in topvorm en ik had het idee dat hij het opnieuw zou gaan flikken dit is geen goed einde van een gigantisch mooie loopbaan het is oneervol en niet prettig ik heb voor mezelf nog geen afdoende antwoord op de vraag wat zijn afscheid precies met me doet maar ik weet wel dat hij het judoleven zal gaan missen misschien wel meer dan hij zelf denkt
3929262 in het judo heb ik veel gewonnen bij defensie heb ik het goed voor elkaar mijn eigen website ziet er fraai uit ik leef alsof alles maakbaar is dat wil ik niet meer
3929263 het was heel gestructureerd als ik opstond wist ik al precies wat ik ging doen en ook wat ik vijf maanden later zou gaan doen maar ik heb ook maar n vriend daar ga ik soms mee vissen dat is het dan

3929265 je kunt denken aan de sluiting van enkele v amp ds voor een paar uur of het stilleggen van het werk bij distributiecentra in amsterdam of groningen
3929266 de medewerkers van v amp d hebben veel over zich heen gekregen de afgelopen jaren winkels gingen dicht de werkweek werd zonder extra loon opgeschroefd van 35 naar 38 uur het personeelsbestand werd steeds jonger en minder ervaren voor de vaste krachten betekent dat voortdurend extra inspanning

3929279 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3929280 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3929281 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3929282 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3929283 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3929284 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3929285 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3929286 i never thought there was such underlying hatred or bigotry
3929287 when i heard about it i was really surprised i couldnt believe it was them
3929288 its pretty sad when you see the true sides of half of these people around here
3929289 its not good when you go out and you have your small children and theyre saying take your dirty mexicans home and give them a bath
3929290 you do go out but not without watching your back
3929291 if that happened to a white person every church in this god n f ing town wouldnt do a god n thing about it
3929292 just because theyre f ing border jumpers and came over here
3929293 i cant say you know the mexicans came here and now theres problems
3929294 yeah obviously ive been here my whole life and ive never had a problem now theres problems
3929295 because itll set a precedent that they can do that to the mexican people
3929296 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3929297 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3929298 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3929299 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3929300 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3929301 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3929302 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3929303 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3929304 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3929305 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3929306 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3929307 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3929308 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3929309 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3929310 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3929311 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3929312 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3929313 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3929314 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3929315 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3929316 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about
3929317 the president should come from a technology background and understand technology at a high level
3929318 it would be good if the person at the helm of the country had an appreciation of the changes taking place as we speak
3929319 is it more complex than a nuclear power plant hardly
3929320 anything to do with technology becomes a distraction at some level
3929321 i dont think were going to find him on facebook or chatrooms
3929322 a mechanical problem is not always solved by a mechanical widget
3929323 his desire to deal with the problem will be motivated by his experience with the box
3929324 the fact that they maintain and secure the it infrastructure is ten times more important than anything you do
3929325 its not so much the use of it but theres a level of familiarity theres a sense of what it means for this amount of information about peoples interconnections to be out there
3929326 if the president himself is not tech savvy there will be someone who will be in effect the person calling the shots on these issues of where technology meets public policy and that i think would be pretty scary
3929327 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3929328 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3929329 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3929330 having a local transplant team make the decision more or less on its own under the pressure of getting hearts to help children dying on their waiting lists is not an objective way to establish that criteria
3929331 the public is nervous enough about organ donation without making them wonder if they or their children would be killed or have their death hastened in order to get transplantable organs
3929332 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3929333 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3929334 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks

3929345 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3929346 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3929347 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3929348 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3929349 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3929350 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3929351 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3929352 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3929353 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3929354 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3929355 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3929356 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3929357 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3929396 an obama presidency will mean zero income taxes for you
3929397 among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3929398 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3929399 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3929400 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3929404 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante

3929407 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3929408 he did real well he was able to put a different hat on
3929409 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
3929410 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
3929411 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3929412 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms with such a shocking and senseless attack
3929413 there was a time when i was injured and resting at home one day i was walking in my house and when i turned the corner to my living room i saw a ray of light a person had come into the room it was an angel a real angel that came out of the painting on the wall
3929414 do you understand its a real angel god showed a real angel before me
3929415 do you believe in god if you do ive got holy water here and i can baptise you just a little dot on the forehead
3929416 im going to drink myself dangerously stupid and stand by a stream with a stick in my hand while the fish swim by in complete safety
3929417 there is no rational thought pattern connected with it and you have no chance at all of making it logical
3929418 i was listening to you its just that i have things on my mind
3929419 i was wondering if that redhead over there is wearing a bra
3929420 i remember the theme song to f troop the address of the first girl i ever kissed and the vehicle identification numbers of every car ive ever owned but i forgot your birthday
3929421 i was just thinking about you and got you these roses
3929422 the girl selling them on the corner was a real babe
3929423 oh dont fuss i just cut myself its no big deal
3929424 i have actually severed a limb but will bleed to death before i admit that i am hurt
3929425 and i sure hope i think of some pretty good reasons soon
3929426 it didnt fall into my outstretched hands so im completely clueless
3929427 i havent the foggiest clue what you just said and am hoping desperately that i can fake it well enough so that you dont spend the next 3 days yelling at me
3929428 i am used to the way you yell at me and realize it could be worse
3929429 my comment is that the investigation was inadequate in my view there was a failure to gather meaningful evidence with respect to this matter that includes the failure of the attending police to apparently do any initial assessment as to the condition of mr harvey zenk in any meaningful way
3929430 to secure the scene for safety and investigational purposes safeties of the other members of the travelling public and investigational purposes particularly in terms of accident reconstruction
3929431 to carry out an immediate investigation as to how and why this occurred who caused the accident and what was that persons condition
3929432 i am 48 years old i was stunned and dazed i was having extreme diffucilty breathing i can only describe getting hit by the air bag as being hit by a base ball bat full force in the chest i was taken to the hospital and 3 days later developed simple whiplash to the neck i still have neck pain to this day
3929433 i fell asleep also at the wheel about 2 years ago and destroyed my car hit a divider from an exit right of the lincoln cops said being tired like that is same as being heavily drunk waking up to an airbag in your face is not cool luckily i only came out wit a scratch on my chin this was the second time i got hit with an airbag shit feels like a 300 football player just tackled you
3929434 he was going twice the rate of speed i was
3929435 i was going about 40 to 50 kilometers per hour
3929436 young cyclists ride at speeds averaging 11 to 16 kilometres an hour if a crash happens a correctly worn helmet cuts the risk of injury by as much as 88 per cent even mild head injuries can cause long term problems children with mild head injuries usually have trouble with their memory concentration and paying attention this makes learning difficult they may also have headaches dizzy spells and fatigue for one in ten children these difficulties may last a lifetime
3929437 cops said being tired like that is same as being heavily drunk

3929451 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3929452 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3929453 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
3929454 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena
3929455 is it an explosive situation that can create a backlash sure but thats not what i see
3929456 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too
3929457 now these men can get back to doing the work they love
3929458 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
3929459 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check

3929465 an hiv positive person will not be allowed to continue as it is not safe the high levels of molecular disintegration that takes place during baboonization can lead to unforeseen complications
3929466 if we dont then well look like the act that opened in atlantic city two stumblebums getting paid a load of cash were getting a bundle and we have to look like we deserve it an audience can see anybody on the bowery wearing a gray suit and lying in the gutter yet but when a comic takes a fall in a thousand dollar tux thats funny dont ask me why but i know what im talking about

3929504 this law is a great first step toward bringing ecb into the 21st century and hopefully starting a new era where tax paying homeowners and small businesses no longer feel harassed by their own government
3929505 mayor bloomberg and the council recognized that this was an area ripe for reform and we worked together to pass a sensible law that will start that process
3929506 ortho means right the right molecules in the right amounts orthomolecular medicine leads to the best health and the greatest decrease in disease it is the most effective prevention in the treatment of disease
3929507 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3929508 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3929509 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
3929510 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
3929511 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3929512 wear mosquito repellent whenever you are outdoors and long sleeves and pants in the morning and evening new yorkers over 50 years old need to be especially careful because they are most likely to suffer serious illness or death if they contract the virus
3929513 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
3929514 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
3929515 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
3929516 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
3929517 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
3929518 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
3929519 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
3929520 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
3929521 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
3929522 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
3929523 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
3929524 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with spain

3929526 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
3929527 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3929528 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3929529 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3929530 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3929531 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3929532 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3929533 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3929534 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3929535 army values are not just what we do they are who we are
3929536 i served by doing it the right way the best way i knew how
3929537 you are not ready to do anything but drink beer and party when you are 19 but you are thrust into the frying pan and you do what you have to do
3929538 running the company has been all ive known for 20 plus years

3929540 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong
3929541 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3929542 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3929543 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3929544 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3929545 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3929546 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3929547 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3929548 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3929549 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3929550 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3929551 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3929552 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3929553 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
3929554 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range
3929555 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3929556 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3929557 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy
3929558 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3929559 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour
3929560 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand
3929561 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again
3929562 as such it would be premature at this stage to embark on proposals such as the setting up of new government bodies to support certain forms of financial activity
3929563 the chairman of the democratic party of arkansas was killed wednesday by a gunman who barged into the partys state headquarters and opened fire police and democratic leaders said
3929564 lieutenant hastings said the motive for the shooting was unclear
3929565 thats something that well be looking into right now we dont have an answer for you on that
3929566 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3929567 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3929568 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3929569 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said iga didnt miss chance metcash

3929571 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3929572 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3929573 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3929574 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3929575 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3929576 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3929577 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defence department
3929578 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3929579 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3929580 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september the 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
3929581 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3929582 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3929583 i came back last year and played 28 games and scored 10 goals i made an impact and ill do the same again this year whether it means ill play less games or more well see
3929584 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills
3929585 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3929586 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3929587 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted
3929588 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3929589 our residential business also performed well despite deteriorating buyer sentiment and our ability to once again grow profits through a tough residential cycle demonstrates the quality and diversity of our business
3929590 active asset management and low occupancy costs should enable us to deliver further operational upside despite the recent slowdown in consumer spending
3929591 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints
3929592 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
3929593 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the scale of casualties
3929594 human rights watch researchers also saw armed ossetian militia members in camouflage fatigues taking household items furniture television sets heaters suitcases carpets and blankets out of houses in the village of nizhniy kvemo achabeti and loading them into their trucks
3929595 of course they are entitled to take things from georgians now because they lost their own property in tskhinvali and other places
3929596 told detectives a voice said go and thats when he shot and killed the detective
3929597 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
3929598 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
3929599 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3929600 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation

3929602 you need guys to shut people down out there and thats what he does
3929603 and the best thing is hed be there first to say hes got room for improvement
3929604 we all have an ego but he keeps his ego in check he cares about the team hes a hard worker hes the first one in line for all of our drills he tries to do it exactly like you ask him to do it hes humble hes hardworking hes just just everything you would want
3929605 and its time to go make plays on the ball
3929606 he went out in his contract year and had an excellent year
3929607 and were fortunate to sign him to a long term deal here which hopefully means he ends his career here that is sort of the right thing you know hes a local kid played at wazzu to play your whole career in the state of washington is pretty unique
3929608 i feel established but yet at the same time im working hard ive got to get better

3929618 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3929619 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3929620 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3929621 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3929622 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3929623 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3929624 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3929880 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels

3929891 now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably
3929892 when we look at alliances in different regions we have had discussions with multiple companies in russia
3929893 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it
3929894 small efficient vehicles are not short term strategies for honda they are part of a fundamental commitment that goes back to hondas entry into the auto industry in the 1970s

3929906 last year we struggled numbers are going to help us this year just promoting the sport of football and its a year round endeavor and the kids have bought into that for the most part
3929907 i think we like to hit and we like to smash them in the mouth and well hittings pretty much the big thing about it i hope we accomplish at least a few wins this year and to gain a little respect from other people

3929914 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
3929915 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3929916 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how if barack is the man we hope for him to be a transformative figure of great change and quality judgement we would expect such a person to choose a vp based upon their ability to execute their vision upon his absence rather than the less idealistic political gains of gaining votes in the general election
3929917 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done

3929924 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3929925 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3929926 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3929927 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3929928 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3929929 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

3929939 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3929940 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3929941 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3929942 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3929943 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3929944 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3929945 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3929946 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3929947 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction

3929960 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy

3929962 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3929963 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3929964 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3929965 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3929966 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
3929967 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3929968 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3929969 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
3929970 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
3929971 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
3929972 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years

3929977 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3929978 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3929979 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
