4730000 oh god im so hungry i feel like im going to pass out
4730001 they will feed us right theyre not just going to leave us to starve are they
4730002 this counts as cruel and unusual torture arent there conventions against this
4730003 and why dont you what did they expect us to share
4730004 if they did they clearly didnt know you well enough
4730005 though now that you mention it you are smaller now we might both fit
4730006 i dont think im actually that much smaller just differently
4730007 god i hurt all over my stomach hurts and my back hurts even my breasts hurt why didnt anyone warn me that breasts would be so painful
4730008 youve been a woman for almost three weeks now its perfectly natural
4730009 youre not going to start talking about moon cycles and ocean tides now are you
4730010 just trying to make conversation rodney people do that sometimes when theyre locked in prison cells together all night long
4730011 oh well uh we kind of put it on hold until i get my body back
4730012 it was weird enough having cadman along for our first date it took us almost a year to go out again the last thing we needed right now was this
4730013 im giving you a back rub mckay itll help with the pain
4730014 what do you guys do when you get it on missions
4730015 i mean youve never mentioned anything and ive never noticed
4730016 i dont know i havent had it since we got to atlantis
4730017 i think its just almost dying every week or so its kind of stressful here lean forward
4730018 arent there pills or something to stop it injections you think if we get back tomorrow carson can give me something before it starts
4730019 im pretty tired though i think im going to go to sleep
4730020 what i meant was why havent you figured out how to change back yet
4730021 human biology is complicated and its really not my field are you thinking on
4730022 yes im thinking on this isnt my first time you know
4730023 and thats bullshit youre a genius ive seen your come up with solutions to way more complex problems than this in half the time
4730024 look if i could devote all my time to it im sure i would have my body back by now but i cant
4730025 why not you do want to change back dont you
4730026 works just as well as the last one i mean were fighting wraith here and genii and replicators and do you really think i could live with myself if people die in the next attack because i was too busy trying to get my penis back to bother fixing the shield generators
4730027 that was the last of them you can go now
4730028 i mean no i just remembered i left something on in the lab i forgot i need to go finish right now very urgent
4730029 what part of very urgent did you not understand colonel
4730030 look im sorry im not buxom or blonde or a genius physicist but i hadnt realized thatd be deal breaker for you
4730031 oh wow jane you you realize im not actually a woman right
4730032 uh of course you do so its just because of
4730033 i mean i i know you said i was hot but you really you want
4730034 you can either stop talking and walk away and tomorrow well pretend this never happened
4730035 and so in conclusion that is why we need to shut off all secondary systems until the new naquadah circuits from dr carter get here next week
4730036 if you think its necessary rodney then you have my permission well put all non essential research projects on hold
4730037 i wasnt sure if i should come if i if it was too late
4730038 is that the reason you came here mckay to tell me my poster was creepy
4730039 im not used to this body i dont understand it at all
4730040 you know im not actually trying to kill you right
4730041 we get one system down and another one comes back online zelenka just ordered me to go sleep and promised to do horrible things to my coffee if i came back before one
4730042 zelenkas an idiot i do my best work when im sleep deprived
4730043 the last attempt at rerouting the power was an abysmal failure and now were down 7 of the zpm since last night
4730044 im going to start here i bet your nipples are really sensitive
4730045 im sore and raw all over is this what it feels like for girls and my head is killing me youre not stashing coffee anywhere in here are you
4730046 except the coffee part thats all you and no im not hoarding coffee who do you think i am
4730047 scarily it looks actually looks just like i thought it would in the morning
4730048 i am going for a run rononll be here any minute you are welcome to stay but i should warn you i wasnt lying about there not being any coffee
4730049 do you have any idea how many layers of security i have on my door
4730050 i cant imagine why you dont have anything interesting in here anyways
4730051 seems a little far fetched they dont even take into account the effect of m particle theory on their findings
4730052 what so maybe ive been hanging around the labs too much lately
4730053 hows it going doctor its been a while since ive seen you around
4730054 im fine colonel though i have to admit were all a little bored this week without any power for our research
4730055 right right sorry about that we really didnt have a choice
4730056 hello ive been trying to tell you im dr mckay
4730057 the genii told us dr mckay fixed their shielding and assisted them with their weapons
4730058 look they obviously want something fixed and our chances of survival go way up if i can get to the other side of these bars
4730059 hey ill have you know there is no reason a woman couldnt comprehend anything a man can
4730060 there is no biological factor that makes women in any way inferior mentally
4730061 this really is dr mckay if you need something done perhaps we can come to some kind of agreement
4730062 ill go report the matter and see what the lord protector has to say
4730063 so mckay i saw you and katie in the hall this morning
4730064 i didnt realize it would be such a cause for concern
4730065 its all right we just want to see you with someone who makes you happy
4730066 look she wanted to it was just it wasnt right it didnt work out
4730067 as if you people even have the knowledge to comprehend my mistakes
4730068 youre going to have to feed us you know i dont do my best work in hypoglycemic shock
4730069 no its not fine it hurts like hell every time i blink and its only going to get worse and ill probably have a scar but thats besides the point because i have a plan and also youre hurting me
4730070 if you think theyll be able to find the address we got gated to sometime in this century you clearly havent met my science team
4730071 if you dont want to spend the rest of your life in here we have to go with my plan
4730072 your plan involves you going back out there for them to beat you again and god knows what else
4730073 look next time they come in to get you well overpower them
4730074 and were in a prison colonel there are at least five more heavily armed guards just outside in the hallway no my plan is better
4730075 just remember youre a woman now you can kick him in the balls
4730076 do you really think i wouldnt do that as a man
4730077 and weve been made i locked jamison back in the control room but i didnt have time to disable all the systems hes going to get out and he knows were behind this we have to hurry
4730078 oh this reckless disregard for your own safety is just so typical of you
4730079 well id rather i wasnt stitching up bullet wounds for any of you and jane this is a serious injury and i expect you to treat it as such youre lucky the bullet only grazed the side of your thigh or youd be in surgery right now as it is youre still going to be on crutches for at least the next three weeks
4730080 now perhaps one of you could help escort the colonel back to her quarters so she can get some rest
4730081 ive scheduled the briefing for tomorrow morning at ten consider yourself under orders to rest until then understood
4730082 go to the mess or something shouldnt you be in hypoglycemic shock by now
4730083 you can go now mckay in case you havent noticed im not exactly in any condition to put out tonight
4730084 you do get that im not just some guy girl whatever that youre fucking right im actually your friend
4730085 can i help you with anything get you anything i could help you get changed
4730086 great timing mckay if youre hungry im sure you can find something to eat in your own quarters
4730087 uh uh not so you can just throw it up
4730088 look not all of us have delicate stomachs okay itll be fine
4730089 im just going to the mess ill pick you something up and ill be right back ok
4730090 its uh pudding as you can see i thought itd be the easiest thing to eat they didnt have any butterscotch left after lunch so its just vanilla
4730091 carson said it would take a few minutes to kick in
4730092 look jane i get that you think im kind of a jerk
4730093 i mean weve spent a lot of time together over the years a lot of long missions and puddle jumper rides and i know i talk a lot and i tend to say everything im thinking but just because i never stop talking it doesnt mean that everything i end up saying is what i really mean im not a jerk not really
4730094 right the medicines probably kicking in now you should sleep
4730095 hey you got any more of those big white pills
4730096 you do realize that not all of us here are as skinny as teenage boys
4730097 you know when we get sams circuits well be able to adapt them to the way the zpms are wired to the city and our power output will increase exponentially its kind of genius really though dont tell her i said that
4730098 do you think shes heard about my being uh changed
4730099 god i cant take you anywhere dont you have military things to do guns to shoot stuff to blow up
4730100 do you have any idea whats going to happen here if i leave the room
4730101 im not seeing a downside there this isnt a crisis rodney
4730102 and its just a matter of time before someone complains to elizabeth about the work hours
4730103 if they want fourteen hour workdays ill happily send them back to earth
4730104 was it radek i bet it was that squirrelly little czech bastard
4730105 yes radek asked me to lock you in a supply closet and do obscene things until you forgot your own name
4730106 jane i told you to use them for three weeks
4730107 well ive actually been meaning to talk to you about something have you noticed anything odd with rodney lately
4730108 and about that why is he still a woman i cant believe there werent any clues in the ancient database and even if there werent youre a geneticist cant you figure something out
4730109 i have actually thats why i was asking you about rodney zelenka and i discovered how to change him back over a week ago
4730110 rodney said he wasnt ready yet i must admit i cant pretend to understand i thought hed be thrilled to return to his old self
4730111 no its not about the reports i actually wanted to ask you a favor
4730112 remember how dr weir said shed throw a party when we broke the off world injury record
4730113 i think itd be good for the men everyones been pushing hard lately were at nine days now we only have to make it to eleven
4730114 yes probably but i noticed that sga 1 was running a mission this thursday i thought maybe youd want to push it back a day or two
4730115 there are three other teams running missions this week why do you think my teams going to stop us from setting the record didnt you read the briefing theyre just peaceful farmers
4730116 well get some cloaked jumpers in the air but theyll only fire if its absolutely necessary
4730117 i think the throttle was damaged in the hit i took
4730118 jane this isnt a puddle jumper the dart wont survive the impact
4730119 though i didnt go off world so its not like it would have counted
4730120 indeed in fact i believe our partys beginning in just a few hours why dont you get some rest before then colonel
4730121 its good to see rodney back to normal i must say he dealt impressively well with the whole ordeal
4730122 if itd been me i dont know how i wouldve handled it
4730123 excuse me im going to go see how hes holding up
4730124 hey give me a break ok id rather not have to chase you through any more corridors these crutches suck
4730125 i get it jane i do youre not interested in men in me i knew that from the beginning
4730126 i just dont get why you had to choose me when you could have had any woman on this base in this galaxy probably i didnt even i mean youre not even my type and you have stupid hair and you go around doing dumb things to get yourself killed i never thought never imagined that but now its all i think about
4730127 it was when you asked me to throw you off the balcony
4730128 when you were a woman it was easy but i think its time i stop being such a fucking coward
4730129 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4730130 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4730131 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4730132 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4730133 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4730134 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4730135 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4730136 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4730137 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4730138 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4730139 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4730140 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4730141 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4730142 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico

4730144 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4730145 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4730146 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4730147 i pray to linda i pray for her soul every day
4730148 i also pray that one day you and your family will be forgiving also im so sorry
4730149 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
4730150 the economic slowdowns impact on middle aged and older americans
4730151 we believe that directed edges technology is the key to finding information that really interests users
4730152 its a nice way to show people what our engine is capable of and what it can do for customers sites its a big first step for us
4730153 its a very exciting technological area we knew at first sight that we could make great use of it
4730154 i believe their graph analysis can really make an impact on our site and were looking forward to working with them

4730177 hey theres a new law today you just lost your right to respond
4730178 and therefore we strike down this part of the law as unconstitutional
4730179 and therefore we will retroactively rewrite the law so it is constitutional again saving congress and the president the trouble of having to do it themselves and oh lookie here according to this new law we just made up you did have a constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to file your petition but it expired two years ago
4730180 as of 90 days from now you have 30 days to file your petition
4730181 the amendments shall take effect upon the date of the enactment

4730183 well now that i know how each of the specific scenarios works i can rely on knowing the behavior that results from the scenario im in for example since im using visual studio 2008 the answer is yes
4730184 either a thing will happen or it wont therefore all events have a 50 probability of happening
4730185 visual studio is the only way to go who cares about borland
4730186 version numbers like 7 0 and 7 1 would be much better
4730187 why the point of the blog was to advise against trying to rely on whether youd get the dll process detach or not and giving specific version numbers would more easily allow people go against that advice
4730188 the interpretation of the value returned from dllmain changed and you say this isnt a behavior change
4730189 igor are you a pita in real life or only when you comment in blogs
4730190 a point to remember your dll is not the most important in the world to veto the whole process launch

4730227 billboard hot 100 at number 12 and entered many other charts including the billboard and many more
4730228 the biggest difference to me is the fact that you grow artistically whenever youre being creative and weve been creative for the past couple of years our artistry has grown when we wrote the truth we named the album the truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans we want everybody to know that theyre not alone going through these things and were here

4730246 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4730247 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4730248 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4730249 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4730250 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4730251 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4730252 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4730253 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4730254 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4730255 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
4730256 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4730257 that papers are biased useless as far as most things are concerned but not sourav
4730258 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4730259 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4730260 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4730261 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4730262 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4730263 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4730264 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4730265 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4730266 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4730267 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4730268 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4730269 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4730270 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4730271 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4730272 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4730273 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4730274 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4730275 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4730276 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4730277 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4730278 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4730279 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4730280 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4730281 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4730282 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4730283 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4730284 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4730285 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

4730287 shortly before four in the afternoon on the third monday in the month of may the people of the city of metropolis learned the meaning of joy they had no explanation for this feeling and there were gaps in their knowledge of what had gone on in their lives so far that day it was as though they were all waking up or at least opening their eyes for the first time in an awfully long time the first thing many of them saw was the red and blue figure of superman drawing a line across their sky and he became the symbol of their joy it felt like a miracle though none could say why

4730300 a legal notice under the environmental protection act was served on wiosna demanding he reduce the volume or stop playing music

4730305 liverpool do have a good team but they cant challenge united or chelsea
4730306 its not just about changing one or two players its about not really having to change the team
4730307 the guys seem to think its more likely to be something off the field these are exciting times for the club when i signed i knew the club were going places and i think this might be the start of something big
4730308 it was good to come into a team that is playing well they had won at wigan so they were on the up
4730309 i was pleased with my debut but im a work in progress i hadnt played for a while so the more games i get the better it will be for me
4730310 weve touched on the play offs briefly were taking it game by game we need a win this week and next week will take care of itself
4730311 at this level only points can talk for you so we as a team need to work hard and get those people quiet
4730312 the players are happy but you would expect us to be happy because we havent kicked a ball yet in the premier league
4730313 when i signed i looked at the fixture list and it looked like a blessing
4730314 its three tough games in my opinion but three winnable games but its about the quality and mentality on the day
4730315 it is a good start for us but fulham will see that as a good start for them so were looking forward to it we know its going to be a hard game but were going into it with our eyes widely open and were excited about it
4730316 we have tried to block that gap and hopefully marlon will go some way towards doing that
4730317 at any level whether its the premiership or league one or the conference if youve got a goalscorer youve got a chance
4730318 marlons come in weve got big caleb obviously the evergreen dean windass we have got players who can put the ball in the back of the net but its up to us as individuals and as a team to create the chances for them
4730319 what you need from your strikers is double figures that gives you a big chance to stay in that division
4730320 i believe in the challenge but in a realistic challenge and hull city is a realistic challenge to stay in this division
4730321 speed is one of the largest contributory factors in all fatal and serious injury collisions
4730322 the greater the speed upon impact in a crash the more severe the injuries will be
4730323 the impact on a family when a loved one is killed on the road is devastating
4730324 we see this on a regular basis and it is one of the most unpleasant experiences we have to deal with

4730331 i actually opted not to do anything to my reproductive organs because i wanted to have a child one day i see pregnancy as a process and it doesnt define who i am
4730332 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4730333 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4730336 its just sex daniel its not a big deal at least it doesnt have to be
4730337 i know youre gay daniel whys it such a big deal
4730338 im not exactly grotesque daniel so why are you acting like itd be a hardship to get our rocks off together
4730339 its not like im asking you for the whole romantic deal
4730340 well you didnt seem to be going for that idea so i figure a one night stand is better than nothing
4730341 maybe the fact that you just implied you want and i quote the whole romantic deal from me
4730342 i think its time for you to tell me what it is you really want from me because im starting to think its not just a one night stand or even a fuck buddy relationship
4730343 youre gay im gay whats wrong with releasing a bit of tension together once in a while but if youre not prepared to fuck me theres no way in hell im letting you fuck with my mind just just go
4730344 all i want is a straight answer and then ill go if its still something you want
4730345 straight no danny boy i think im about as far from straight as a man can get
4730346 you want me to say im so in love with you my heart breaks every time you get up and leave me you want me to say that youre the first one since sara that i think i could have a life with you want me to say that i would give up everything everything daniel my job my career my friends everything if only youd say that i could have you for one night you want me to tell you what id do anything to have you for the rest of my life forever because thats what i want daniel forever with you
4730347 now tell me you wanted to hear all that because i wont believe you
4730348 and break your heart just what kind of man do you think i am jack
4730349 i think youre the kind of man who wouldnt humiliate me with pity daniel
4730350 i want to spend the rest of my life with you
4730351 why do you think i kept saying no every time you asked me for a casual roll in the sack i couldnt bear the thought of having you once and then losing you once the novelty wore off

4730373 not only because the words he has uttered could never have escaped from his lips if he were suffering but because no matter how many american soldiers have died on a given day in iraq averaging well over two every day he is always seen with a big smile on his face that same day or the next and is in good spirits

4730428 dobro je relativno sam ok ove su igre ne to za to sam radila posljednjih 12 godina i kad bih vam rekla da sam jako opu tena i da jedva ekam natjecanje onda bih vas definitivno slagala istina nema problema sa spavanjem to sam prije znala imati pred osaku nisam mjesec dana dobro spavala i stalno sam bila nervozna ovdje toga nema jedino to esto sanjam mre u i kavez mislim si samo da kladivo iza e iz kaveza i sve e biti dobro ja uop e ne sumnjam u svoju formu trebaju mi samo ispravni hici to je ono s ime sam imala problema ove godine esto sam na natjecanjima imala samo dva ispravna poku aja pa je to jedino zbog ega sam malo nesigurna no to je dobro jer nikad ne treba biti previ e siguran u sebe prije nastupa nadam se da u kvalifikacijama ne e biti nikakvih problema moja tehnika bacanja je takva da kada pogodim kladivo leti jako daleko a ako napravim samo mali trzaj glavom pogre no hitac se drasti no skra uje
4730429 to je zato jer ima jako puno cura koje su ne znam gdje sve bacale daleko pa su u iaaf u malo zbunjeni kad vide da ima primjerice etiri bjeloruskinje preko 73 metra visokom normom se organizator titi od mogu eg prevelikog broja finalistica realnost je dakako sasvim druk ija za finale e biti dovoljno negdje oko 69 metara a to mo e baciti svaka baca ica koja je ovdje samo dvanaest najboljih e me utim bacati u finalu

4730431 i mucked up my visa last time i was out there so ive got a three year ban
4730432 my six months came to an end i turned up at the airport and they took me to a room where they gave me a bit of a lecture
4730433 theres not a great deal you need to say to joe
4730434 hes still a young bloke and has got a lot of time to come
4730435 generally in this game if youre scoring runs then youre going to get what you deserve and i think hes probably aware of that more than anybody
4730436 one of the good things about him is that hes pretty honest with himself when hes not scoring runs and when hes not doing as well
4730437 theres a lot of us that go out there from senior guys to young players who always think the world is against them but joe doesnt do that and gets on with it and thats refreshing
4730438 there is a lot of rubbish spoken by a lot of people at times in a cricket dressing room about how hard done by they are
4730439 its quite nice especially when sir ian botham and people like that are touting your name for england captain
4730440 theres not that many people who get talked about as a potential england captain when they arent even in the side
4730441 its something i will be pretty proud about at the end of my career even if i dont ever play for england again
4730442 its been an interesting few weeks but sometimes in the county season its not how you start but how you finish
4730443 thats when the tours are announced and a good end for either myself or joe could do us the world of good
4730444 england lions are going to be in india so if youre hitting a few balls nothing is too far away for a short flight
4730445 what will be will be but i imagine ive got a chance
4730446 one of the things weve heard said has been key and denly to open the batting for england which wed obviously quite enjoy
4730447 it would make both our lives a little bit easier playing cricket with the bloke you bat with every day in every form of the game
4730448 that would be plan a and plan b would be that id get in and joe doesnt
4730449 its nice to be spoken about and it would be nice to get into a touring squad whether its the lions or whatever but im not looking too far ahead and im just focused on each game as it comes and trying to do as well as i can
4730450 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
4730451 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4730452 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4730453 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack

4730456 the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4730457 its not that the anti pollution measures did nothing but their effect is a lot smaller than city fathers would like to admit possibly so small we cant detect the difference
4730458 the pollution plumes can be as high as 2 km to 3 km which has a huge impact
4730459 up at that height they can travel across the pacific in three to four days
4730460 how large and how rapid global warming is going to be over the next few decades may depend on how fast we unmask the pollution
4730461 i always thought i should be treated like a star

4730656 we have a platform for an exhibition depicting our way of making art even though exhibitions usually held here but the process of working and different techniques of an artist have never been displayed people should see it interact because if you dont know the artist it is very difficult to understand his work so we have provided an open platform for the people to come and interact with us
4730657 we have learnt a lot as we are directly interacting with the artists being a student i am getting a great exposure i have always painted by reference drawing but i am learning as how to paint through expressions
4730658 when such events are held they are very useful and enriching i feel so good that we got an opportunity to see a variety of artwork workshops are held in jalandhar and other places in punjab and this adds another jewel to its crown
4730659 we set up our fishing activity in 1985 here of course for around two to three years we incurred losses when excess tidal saline water enters our lake it is not favourable we sensed the prospects of this place being a good place for tourism we approached the officials and then the ball was set rolling during off season we breed fish here poomai and chemeen prawns are the prime varieties of fish
4730660 it has been a very good ambience set here with all this nature spreading across backwaters the rafting facility was quite a different thing offered here
4730661 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
4730662 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night

4730664 we want to make good citizens not just produce clerks we want good citizens good engineers and good doctors
4730665 today the people suffering due to dishonesty corruption and all evils in society so we want to prepare the new generation who has to take up issues for the good of this country when they grow up they must be honest first so with that objective we have started this honesty shop

4730698 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4730699 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4730700 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4730701 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4730702 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4730703 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4730704 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4730705 it is possible that testing for this abnormal expression may become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4730706 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer

4730728 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again

4730753 theres no reason why you need to offer blanket assurances discretion in police work is something that is routinely part of what cops do every single day and it should be applied in this situation also
4730754 it is their responsibility to act when they come across somebody who is violating the law of some other jurisdiction to assist in making sure that person is brought to the attention of the proper authorities
4730755 i think that the fact that theres a city ordinance in place that makes it clear that services will be available regardless of the victims status also sends an important message to the community that if you need police to protect your safety you should feel safe in reaching out

4730779 ganas e ilusi n de volver a empezar y seguir rellenando el palmar s con t tulos que es lo que todo el mundo est deseando
4730780 la pasada temporada fui m s irregular tuve algunos altibajos y la verdad es que empiezo con muchas ganas e ilusi n despu s de un tiempo que he tenido para recuperar descansar y desconectar vengo nuevo con ganas de darlo todo de aportar much simo al equipo y de seguir creciendo como jugador que es lo que todo el mundo quiere

4730782 tanto la copa del rey como la liga son muy importantes tambi n pero se vive de forma distinta el real madrid hace tiempo que no consigue una champions y creo que ser a algo important simo

4730792 no es una cosa en vez de la otra es una cosa adem s de la otra y precisamente eso lo planteamos como una respuesta a la crisis por lo tanto no es que con la crisis vayamos a desistir de hacerlo sino que forma parte de nuestra respuesta a la misma

4730802 a win against houston would solidify what weve believed for some time now
4730803 if we can go to houston and beat the two time defending champions it would speak volumes
4730804 they were playing as well as anyone here to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4730805 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4730806 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4730807 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4730808 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4730809 they probably will be the third team in our group
4730810 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday
4730811 i still cant believe that we came back and won that match
4730812 but i was thinking it would be a pretty gnarly comeback if we make the comeback
4730813 i saw myself leading 9 4 10 6 11 8 you look at the score it was 6 0 and now its 7 all its hard to believe even now

4730868 sir do you mind if tonight i recite psalm 23
4730869 i dont understand i have been performing psalm 23 for years i have a lifetime of experience and training but i have never been able to move an audience as you have tonight tell me what is your secret
4730870 well sir you know the psalm i know the shepherd
4730871 sir would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side there doesnt appear to be a passageway by foot
4730872 sir i notice that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride then i came up and you immediately asked me for a ride im curious why on such a bitter winter night you would wait and ask the last rider what if i had refused and left you there
4730873 ive been around these here parts for some time i reckon i know people pretty good
4730874 i looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no concern for my situation it would have been useless even to ask them for a ride but when i looked into your eyes kindness and compassion were evident i knew then and there that your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need
4730875 may i never get too busy in my own affairs that i fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion

4730892 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
4730893 people voted for change and they voted for democrats who will take our country in a new direction
4730894 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
4730895 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
4730896 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
4730897 who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table nobody told them to do this
4730898 one million iraqis are dead five thousand americans are dead you have destroyed the first second fourth fifth and eighth amendments
4730899 i take an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the united states and dont tell me that i dont do that
4730900 why dont you go picket the republicans in congress that will not allow us to have a vote on the war this is not very effective not very effective
4730901 as speaker of the house the third highest office first is the president then vice president and then speaker i take my responsibilities deadly seriously
4730902 i try to promote bipartisanship but thats not what the other side wants
4730903 i didnt assume that whatever bob joseph and i agreed upon was going right into the presidents desk in the oval office
4730904 within this context now finally clarified by foley bob josephs decision to make an unremarkable call to a friend who rarely saw tenet or his seventh floor disciples and not tell this friend that hes the last check in one of modern historys most contentious phrases before it ends up on the presidents lips was a perfect way to get something cia doubted and its director had already opposed into the big speech
4730905 believed there may well have been something to the claims that the iraqis sought to purchase uranium from niger
4730906 the italian letter how the bush administration used a fake letter to build the case for war in iraq
4730907 if the president wants to go to war our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so
4730908 i was told that foley had focused on clearing the speech for sources and methods rather than for substance
4730909 in other words as long as the language didnt give away any secrets about how the intelligence was collected they didnt worry about whether we believed the assertions in the speech were accurate that was a terrible mistake our job was never to clear solely for sources and methods but also for substance and the last time i looked as good as the british intelligence service is and it is very good it does not work for the president of the united states
4730910 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4730911 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4730912 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4730913 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4730914 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4730915 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the defense contract audit agency dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments
4730916 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4730917 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4730918 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4730919 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4730920 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4730921 sanctions genocide planned genocide as part of its religious doctrine
4730922 millions of dollars in u s government grants to radical islamist organizations many of whose leaders have been convicted or indicted in terrorism cases in the united states
4730923 how saddam got weapons of mass destruction saddam husseins war machine is being built systematically to strike at the united states with new nuclear biological and chemical weapons designed to kill millions
4730924 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
4730925 convicted or indicted in terrorism cases in the united states
4730926 a muslim brotherhood affiliated organization which was an unindicted co conspirator in last years terrorist financing trial against the holy land foundation
4730927 publicly challenged the designation of hezbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations
4730928 a number of groups that the state department has funded or collaborated with have links to entities such as al qaida hamas and hezbollah all of which are designated as terrorist organizations by the united states government
4730929 legitimizes islamism to the world and sends mixed messages to our allies while sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding
4730930 that one out of every five dollars spent on the war in iraq has gone to contractors for the united states military and other government agencies in a war zone where employees of private contractors now outnumber american troops
4730931 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
4730932 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
4730933 overbilling fraud and shoddy and unsafe work that has endangered and even killed american troops
4730934 the budget offices report found that from 2003 to 2007 the government awarded contracts in iraq worth about 85 billion and that the administration was now awarding contracts at a rate of 15 billion to 20 billion a year at that pace contracting costs will surge past the 100 billion mark before the end of the year through 2007 spending on outside contractors accounted for 20 percent of the total costs of the war the budget office found according to the people with knowledge of the report
4730935 one whose roles and missions and even casualties among its work force have largely been hidden from public view
4730936 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4730937 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4730938 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4730939 theres something under my skin tonight theres a knife under my skin something pricklin at the back of my neck oh no no no no no

4730950 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
4730951 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
4730952 even if sampson was confused or mistaken in his interpretation of the rules that applied to immigration judge hiring we do not believe that would excuse his actions
4730953 his actions which were carried out over a lengthy period of time and were not based on formal advice from anyone systematically violated federal law and department policy and constituted misconduct
4730954 well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps than those i have described
4730955 for example some commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct
4730956 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
4730957 i am distressed that attorney general mukasey has been so quick to determine that no criminal offense has been committed in connection with the illegal hiring practices at the department of justice
4730958 it is not enough for mr mukasey to assert that things are different under his watch the department of justice cannot reestablish its credibility so long as it persists in a strategy designed to avoid revealing all the facts that have so compromised the integrity of the department of justice and to prevent real accountability for misconduct by former doj officials
4730959 blanket conclusions appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
4730960 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
4730961 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
4730962 among other things the department now has new hiring processes for immigration judges members of the board of immigration appeals honors program candidates and summer law interns with codified roles for career attorneys in the decision making process
4730963 we have instituted mandatory training for all political appointees regarding merit system principles and prohibited personnel practices and we will shortly be expanding that training to include all department employees whether political appointees or not involved in career hiring and we have revised various orders to reiterate the departments commitment to merit systems principles and to remove political appointees in the attorney generals office from the process of hiring career attorneys
4730964 to the extent we can we intend to contact candidates for the attorney generals honors program who may have been improperly eliminated from consideration and encourage them to apply for any vacancies at the department
4730965 each of them will be assured a fair evaluation similarly we will contact those who may have been improperly denied temporary details to jobs at main justice to see if they are interested in any new opportunities that are or may become available
4730966 there is a principle of equity that we all learned in the schoolyard and that remains as true today as when we first heard it two wrongs do not make a right
4730967 that some of the officials involved in hiring gave improper consideration to politics does not mean that the people they hired are unqualified for their jobs it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
4730968 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
4730969 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
4730970 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
4730971 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
4730972 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
4730973 it is clear that he did record some of our conversations but at no time did he inform me that he was doing so or seek my permission
4730974 i plan to consult counsel about the legality of his action
4730975 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service tahir jalil habbush al tikriti to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
4730976 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
4730977 they secretly resettled habbush in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
4730978 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
4730979 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
4730980 far from being comfortable i told mr suskind that many of the things he wrote about what i did and said were wrong
4730981 statement and my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
4730982 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
4730983 they were in fact on white paper i was asked to respond to documents regarding the potential use of habbush upon his defection and during the difficult fall of 2003 when we were wrestling with a developing iraqi insurgency and ways to combat it i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found many of such queries did originate from the staff of the office of the vice president none of this however substantiates mr suskinds explosive allegation
4730984 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr
4730985 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
4730986 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
4730987 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
4730988 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
4730989 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
4730990 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community
4730991 mr suskind appears to have conflated two separate conversations one about the problems of reading saddam husseins intentions an issue which is dealt with in the butler report and one about habbush
4730992 i made it clear to mr suskind that i was in no position to comment on the substance or significance of any dealing with the latter since i had not been privy to the detail of what had taken place something mr suskind has chosen not to mention and in any event i had made it clear to mr suskind when first he approached me that i would not divulge classified information to which i had had access during my time in government
4730993 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go
4730994 from the very first instance it was about iraq it was about what we can do to change this regime
4730995 all of their options which includes appealing the case to the supreme court
4730996 we are disappointed with todays ruling and are considering all of our appellate options
4730997 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
4730998 here not only did these officials cause untold harm to two individuals who honorably served their country they also jeopardized our national security for short term political gain courts must be available to remedy precisely this kind of harm to ensure such conduct is neither condoned nor repeated
4730999 the alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut mr wilsons comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory
4731000 but there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism such as that levied by mr wilson against the bush administrations handling of prewar foreign intelligence by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants duties as high level executive branch officials
4731001 this case is not just about what top government officials did to valerie and me
4731002 we brought this suit because we strongly believe that politicizing intelligence ultimately serves only to undermine the security of our nation todays decision is just the first step in what we have always known would be a long legal battle and we are committed to seeing this case through
4731003 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
4731004 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
4731005 when that guy was working for ken starr he wanted to go open the dresser drawers of the white house
4731006 i guess its a lot different when its a republican vice president
4731007 the referendum in its current form would undermine the vital humanitarian work of many psychologists
4731008 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof

4731010 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4731011 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4731012 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4731013 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4731014 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4731015 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4731016 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4731041 aan astrid gaat een ongelofelijk goede koningin voorbij albert is diezelfde mening toegedaan
4731042 dat heeft hij glashelder gemaakt toen hij het kernkabinet van de eerste regering verhofstadt heeft bijeengeroepen en letterlijk heeft gevraagd of er een mogelijkheid bestond om astrid tot regentes aan te duiden totdat elisabeth meerderjarig is dat bleek helaas niet mogelijk

4731074 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4731075 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4731076 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4731077 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4731078 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4731079 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4731080 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4731081 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4731082 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4731131 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4731132 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4731133 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4731134 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4731135 these are great to decorate an apartment dorm room or any space that has to go back to the way it was before or if you just like to change your mind without re painting
4731136 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4731137 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4731138 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4731139 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4731140 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4731141 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4731142 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4731143 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4731144 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4731145 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4731146 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4731147 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4731148 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4731149 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4731150 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4731151 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4731152 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4731153 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4731154 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4731155 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4731156 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4731157 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4731158 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4731159 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4731160 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4731161 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4731162 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4731163 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4731164 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4731165 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4731166 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4731167 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4731168 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4731169 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4731170 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4731171 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4731172 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4731173 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4731174 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4731175 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4731176 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4731177 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4731178 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4731179 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4731180 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4731181 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4731182 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4731183 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4731184 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4731185 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4731186 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4731187 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4731188 who are open to doing something on the production side
4731189 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4731190 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4731191 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4731192 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4731193 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4731194 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4731195 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4731196 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4731197 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4731198 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4731199 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4731200 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4731201 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4731202 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4731203 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4731204 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4731205 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4731206 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4731207 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4731208 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4731209 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4731210 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4731211 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4731212 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4731213 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4731214 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4731215 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4731216 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4731217 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4731218 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4731219 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4731220 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4731221 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4731222 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4731223 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4731224 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4731225 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4731226 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4731227 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4731228 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4731229 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4731245 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4731246 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4731247 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck

4731255 its annoying for sailing as a sport it does not look good when you cant race because there is no wind
4731256 its not the sports fault its not the sailors fault its the fact that we have been put in this venue where we do not get any wind
4731257 with this venue we always knew it was going to be a bit like this i think you have to accept it and try not to let it wind you up to much
4731258 its only going to make the challenge harder for you
4731259 thats what were dreaming of and well do everything we can to achieve that
4731260 we dont need no attention we all know what we can do
4731261 we will always have people who do not like the way we play but were through to the next round
4731262 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4731263 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4731264 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4731265 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4731266 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4731267 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4731268 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4731269 i see these matches as a fight to the death
4731270 we arent moving back to the more japanese style we are moving forward
4731271 we are modernizing we must make the sport more easy to understand and more exciting to watch
4731272 we believe that its a done deal and it is good for the sport
4731273 it leads the sport into getting more flamboyant throws i think it will boost the sport not only japan
4731274 i think this puts more importance on the role of the coach
4731275 i see these matches as a fight to the death
4731276 we arent moving back to the more japanese style we are moving forward
4731277 we are modernizing we must make the sport more easy to understand and more exciting to watch
4731278 we believe that its a done deal and it is good for the sport
4731279 it leads the sport into getting more flamboyant throws i think it will boost the sport not only japan
4731280 i think this puts more importance on the role of the coach
4731281 captured with a canon 5d with a 70 200mm canon l using a matching 1 4x multiplier
4731282 the last big kick of the night was the chinese zhang zhilei all 6 7 and 200 pounds of him
4731283 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4731284 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4731285 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4731286 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4731287 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4731288 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4731289 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4731290 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4731291 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4731292 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4731293 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4731294 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4731295 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4731296 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4731297 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4731298 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4731299 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4731300 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4731301 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4731302 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4731303 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4731304 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4731305 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4731306 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4731307 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4731308 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4731309 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4731310 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4731311 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4731312 the main quality that i think photographers see in me is my attitude even though originally i do come off as reserved i think that my comfort with myself and with the actual scene and the attitude that i am able to bring to the picture is my best quality
4731313 judicial watch also recently launched a brand new internet site dedicated to fighting illegal alien sanctuary policies across the united states youll be hearing more about this in the next few days but in the meantime you can go to

4731323 the dongria khond adivasi indigenous communities is at risk of forced eviction following a courts recent decision to allow sterlite industries to mine bauxite in their protected forest homeland in niyamgiri area
4731324 we have been approached by various local ngos who alleged that around 800 adivasis will be forcibly evicted and displaced from the three hamlets of phuldumer konakuda and palvari despite the fact that mining is not proposed near the hamlets themselves
4731325 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
4731326 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
4731327 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
4731328 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4731329 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4731330 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
4731331 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient
4731332 they say we fly at night and do not attend to the call of nature on fridays we do not die but vanish and our bodies are good for ritual purposes
4731333 they make us feel bad and unwanted in society indeed the publics misbehaviour towards us is tantamount to racism which the soa g is prepared to fight till our last drop of blood
4731334 we would have gone onto the streets to fight for our rights but the sun is harsh on our bodies however the society is planning to take some actions which would surprise all

4731340 life is like a mechanical bull ride it is not about how many times you fly off the bull it is about how many times you get back on
4731341 for me the draw is the second option because we will be going to ibrox to win
4731342 if we can win its an opportunity to say we are good and we can follow this road
4731343 this is an easy game if we lose no one is saying we are a bad team but if we win everyone will say we are the best because we have beaten rangers at home
4731344 we have respect for rangers but we are not afraid of them
4731345 if everything settles down at the club they have the capability to be up there with some of the best teams in the league and theyre capable of beating any team in the league
4731346 all clubs start with a bit optimism unless you get knocked out of europe and hearts have been like that
4731347 if they do get a bit of impetus going they can be a very dangerous team
4731348 it is a mistake to have the moa ad signed in malaysia before bringing it to congress because a signing would signify that it is already a done deal
4731349 the first step after deliberations should have been a public consultation they should not have sprang this on us
4731350 we oppose any attempt to dismember our country by laying the foundation for the creation of an independent and sovereign bangsamoro state which will be given exclusive ownership of the areas delineated as their homeland
4731351 it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4731352 bravo michael ha detto spitz di fronte a un phelps quasi imbarazzato ti avevo gi visto quattro anni fa ad atene e gi allora avevo capito che avresti potuto farcela perch gi allora avevo visto che non avevi avuto paura di affrontare un mostro come ian thorpe da allora ti sei migliorato di qualcosa come 2
4731353 sinceramente credevo di aver perso la gara e sono senza parole il mio desiderio era di diventare un olimpionico tale da poter essere ricordato sono stato ispirato per anni da mark spitz e ora mi ritrovo insieme a lui nella storia delle olimpiadi insieme a nomi come jesse owens o carl lewis era il mio sogno e non so cosa dire mi mancano le parole

4731359 if anyone has a customs paper in his her name he she has the right to give the cargo to whoever is specified on that paper then the contents belong to the recipient
4731360 the criminals who wreaked such astounding horrors on innocent civilian populations were not acting as soldiers drunk with the fury of battle nor as patriotic fanatics but as chosen instruments of a satanic religion to the service of which they had been dedicated by the systematic teaching and practice of unnatural vice
4731361 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
4731362 open unto us where are the men that came to your house
4731363 had been a male prostitute in vienna at the time of his sojourn there from 1907 to 1912 and that he practiced the same calling in munich from 1912 to 1914
4731364 chose to live in a vienna flophouse known to be inhabited by many homosexuals
4731365 were also to some extent helpful in gaining big money support from ernst ro e hms circle of wealthy gay friends
4731366 reports that he has met two boys who claimed that they were hitlers homosexual partners but their testimony can hardly be taken at face value more condemning
4731367 would be the remarks dropped by albert foerster the danzig gauleiter in conversation with rauschning even here however the remarks deal only with hitlers impotence as far as heterosexual relationships go without actually implying that he indulges in homosexuality it is probably true that hitler calls foerster bubi which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners this alone is not adequate proof that he has actually indulged in homosexual practices with foerster who is known to be a homosexual
4731368 even today hitler derives sexual pleasure from looking at mens bodies and associating with homosexuals
4731369 was originally a school teacher but was dismissed by the nuremberg school authorities following numerous charges of pederasty brought against him
4731370 hitlers homophobia did not surface until 1933 1934 when gays had come to affect adversely his new order designs out of which grew the simple solution of murdering them en masse
4731371 a male who indulges in criminally indecent activity with another male or who allows himself to participate in such activity will be punished with imprisonment
4731372 had defended the weimar republic and who had tried to forestall the nazi threat
4731373 employed the charge of homosexuality primarily as a means to eliminate political opponents both inside his party and out
4731374 although he was well known as a gay activist adolf brand was not arrested by the nazis
4731375 that it could be and was applied against heterosexuals that the nazis wanted to eliminate the law was also used repeatedly against catholic clergymen
4731376 the gestapo readily had recourse to the charge of homosexuality if it was unable to find any pretext for proceeding against catholic priests or irksome critics
4731377 h omosexuals were particularly vulnerable to blackmailers known as chanteure on the homosexual scene
4731378 blackmail and the threat of public exposure resulted in frequent suicides or suicide attempts
4731379 w hen moral barriers collapsed under the impact of nazi preaching the same anti semitic movement that led to the slaughter of the jews gave scope and license to an obscene revolt against god and the moral law an open and implacable war was declared on the christian tradition which unleashed a frenzied and unavowed hatred of christ and the ten commandments
4731380 the inconsistency is not in the bible but in your life
4731381 the reason you dont like the bible you old sinner is because it knows all about you
4731382 i believe that a long step toward public morality will have been taken when sins are called by their right names

4731392 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4731393 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4731394 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4731395 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4731396 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport
4731397 clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
4731398 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend
4731399 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4731400 our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying
4731401 ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend

4731404 hey chrissy you passed out last night and you gave the seniors a heart attack cos you were lying down as if you were a dead log they had great trouble pulling you to our room
4731405 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4731406 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4731407 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront

4731411 in the 21st century nations do not invade other nations
4731412 ive got an extra ticket for the rock the bells show tomorrow you wanna roll
4731413 i would hope that stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
4731414 its new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4731415 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4731416 we never got any respect as artists because we didnt write all the songs and we werent a self producing product
4731417 we were being controlled more like puppets than anything else
4731418 they were formulating how to get a no 1 record i wanted to write my own songs and sing my own music
4731419 it is time for liverpool to make their move in the premier league
4731420 rafa benitez arrived in england at the same time as i did and is beginning his fifth year at the club
4731421 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years
4731422 weaknesses are exposed in that time frame and dealt with
4731423 it is impossible to win the championship without a world class goalkeeper and a world class striker and liverpool have both
4731424 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4731425 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4731426 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4731589 committing the unpardonable offence of outfitting everyone in green crocs
4731590 so sub standard in fact that the labels and embroidery on the athletics vests says
4731591 no one from sascoc is able to comment about the shoddy gear but it is clear the poorly made clothing and lacklustre fitting is going to have a major effect on the teams performance
4731592 while the worlds elite athletes will be dressed in the best and latest running gear available the south african team will be dressed like primary school cross country runners with parents on a budget
4731593 crocs sponsored team sa the national colour of the team is green and gold so sports south africa chose the green because they thought it was more suitable than the yellow goldy colour
4731594 the girls look like frumps in those hideous shapeless to the floor skirts that look more like sacks than clothing
4731595 the biggest no no though is the crocs horror of horrors the end result is east rand valley goes to margate
4731596 judging by how many south africans adorn their feet with those hideous crocs i think the choice may be truly representative of the people of our nation

4731602 we knew she had it in her she started strong and she kept it going all the way through everybody in the room was on their feet screaming and crying theres no word for the emotion it was absolute jubilation
4731603 her face when she looked up at the board and realised what she had done was just fantastic when i spoke to her on the phone i didnt know what to say because well done doesnt cover it really
4731604 she deserves it all she put so much work in both her and her coach to get themselves to where they are now
4731605 its nice for her now she can enjoy it as the pressure is off she has done a lot more than she set out to do so she can relax and watch the rest of the games we are just looking forward to having her home and celebrating as a family
4731606 it was an olympic final so you dont know whats going to happen as its the biggest sporting competition in the world
4731607 we knew she would do well if she got a good start but its fantastic for her to get two golds when we spoke to her she was just being normal becky taking the mickey out of dad and asking how the dogs were
4731608 we dont know how it will change things when she gets back she needs to talk to our parents she will have a holiday and relax and then we will let her do what she wants to do

4731616 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4731617 the whole thing was a conspiracy that started in the mayors office
4731618 do we have an active branch of the naacp in the chambers county alabama the lanett valley area mr tony malone has identified himself as president of the chambers county branch of the naacp i am gwen harris brooks president of the lanett city school board thanks for your reply to this note
4731619 the same day that it was forwarded to the mayor somebody brought it right on to me on tuesday
4731620 i went to lunch and when i returned i was given a copy of the email to this day i dont know who delivered it nor how the person was even able to access it since a persons email is supposed to be secure when i returned from lunch i was told that somebody had come by and left this for me i read it
4731621 it is clear harris and crawley were working together in an effort to both discredit and silence me from speaking out on various issues
4731622 i was not worried about the statements concerning the chambers county naacp branch because i know where we stand with the association
4731623 but what concerns me most is that clearly mrs harris brooks and mayor crawley conspired to cast suspicion on my standing with the community it is obvious from the article in the valley times news that vaughn was led to believe that the branch was endorsing political candidates i would just like to know why regardless of any position i hold in the naacp i can personally endorse any candidate i want to endorse they cant stop that
4731624 i know that cant be true as long as tony malone has been working with the naacp down there in chambers county
4731625 vaughn probably reacted because he felt an immediate threat to the integrity of the naacp at any suggestion that a president would be endorsing candidates in the name of the association the organizations tax exempt status has come under close scrutiny because of claims of suspected political activity
4731626 i dont know if the problem was with our branch or the national but i know i wasnt allowed to vote
4731627 in january of 2007 we forwarded all required materials to re activate our charter and we have not heard from them yet any officer of the naacp can tell you that ours is not the most efficient organization when it comes to maintaining records and such
4731628 but i wish he had checked more thoroughly before issuing such a statement
4731629 perhaps harris and crawley thought they would succeed in preventing me from speaking out on issues i just dont know but there is nothing preventing me from speaking out on any issue im a city councilman and most importantly a citizen
4731630 any concerns regarding the chambers county valley naacp are between ed vaughn and me and at this time are not subject to public debate
4731631 some dudes would rather light their dicks on fire than endure this movie version of the ultimate tv chickcoms

4731641 youve gotta start these things slowly i can see you have a lot to learn
4731642 for example if i were to squeeze this nipple now clarissa would hurt but in 20 minutes or so it might be the sensation that brings her over the edge
4731643 we cannot say what he died of we are awaiting the post mortem results which will determine that
4731644 sometime during the day we heard he was taken out during which time he fell down other prisoners are saying so they took him back to the cell and subsequently this prisoner was discovered not well and subsequently he was pronounced dead at the hospital
4731645 but the doctor did say that the injuries found on the prisoner could have been self inflicted
4731646 and he tried to clutch but the vehicle wasnt clutching i think that is what got him frustrated
4731647 for the first five minutes i was frustrated but i knew that wouldnt help us get out of there
4731648 there were three chinese men me and two others who came here for treatment
4731649 a gang of junkie would normally hang out in the rice mill and smoke almost every night
4731650 jim bacchus did not do a very good job of arranging flights for the students
4731651 the court of appeal roundly criticized ddl for this practice which included their expenses
4731652 right now he in there and aint getting treatment for his sickness he got to get it he get lash in he head when the police beat he up and they aint even carry him to get treatment it was bleeding but it stop
4731653 that guard suppose to check peoples food but they dont do that people would walk in just so and give them patient things nobody checks them procedures are not followed and that is real slackness
4731654 one female nurse cannot work with male patients it is a fine puny nurse and i commend her for her courage because when my son attempted to hang himself it was she who ran to help
4731655 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4731656 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4731657 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4731658 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4731659 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4731660 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4731661 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4731662 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4731663 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4731664 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do

4731692 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4731693 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4731694 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4731709 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4731710 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4731711 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4731712 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4731713 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4731714 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4731715 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4731716 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4731717 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4731718 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4731719 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4731720 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4731721 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4731722 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4731723 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4731724 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4731725 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4731726 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4731727 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4731728 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4731729 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4731730 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4731731 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4731732 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4731733 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4731734 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4731735 die geben power machen die jungs bei olympia doch auch
4731736 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4731737 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4731738 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4731739 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4731740 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4731741 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4731742 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4731743 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4731744 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4731745 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4731746 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4731747 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4731748 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4731749 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4731750 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4731751 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4731752 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4731753 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4731754 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4731755 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4731756 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4731757 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4731758 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4731759 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4731760 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4731761 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4731762 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4731763 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4731764 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4731765 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4731783 the little money we have can now be used for some other priorities like medications and house rent
4731784 the children do not want to miss the early morning snack which is served right at the beginning of the school day and so they make sure they get to school on time
4731785 not only today rice and beans and tomorrow beans and rice
4731786 many more of these children in cit soleil as well as in other slums and poor parts of haiti are hoping like their parents that the near future will be brighter in this and other post conflict areas
4731787 we will be working to bring in other donors to involve other parts of the community in cooking and preparing the childrens meals to combine school feeding with basic health interventions and to strengthen the capacity of the nsfp to run the program on its own

4731789 more and more of those excluded by the rising price of food and desperate from hunger cook mud with oil and salt extreme poverty attacks the caribbean countries the lack of food caused by the production of biofuel
4731790 the greater demand for biofuel means fewer fields are dedicated to food harvesting which in time causes less supplies and higher prices
4731791 plan to fight these price increases which includes the distribution of vouchers for seeds and fertilizers among landworkers in the developing countries in the caribbean food prices have gone up by forty percent in some of the islands in haiti the scarcity is threatening the weak stability of the country and mud cookies are one of the few options the poor have in order not to die
4731792 two cups of rice are sold for sixty cents of a dollar ten cents more than in december and a hundred percent more than a year before beans condensed milk and fruit have gone up at similar rates and edible clay went up to almost a dollar and a half enough mud to cook a hundred cookies costs five dollars

4731843 weve run out of terms ourselves to describe how miserable and desperate the situation is but what is now happening today is yet another manifestation of that reality in terms of peoples determination to break free from this shackle that theyre under at the moment
4731844 we have spoken to the israelis about the importance of not allowing humanitarian crisis to unfold there
4731845 theyve said that they do not want a humanitarian crisis and that they understand the need to permit fuel and electricity in gaza so we will see
4731846 the significance is huge in the sense that the troubles in north kivu have really been a major source of instability not only for the people in north kivu itself but for people in the surrounding region as well

4731862 pero no hace falta m s nadie producimos a nuestros muchachos para que est n al mismo nivel que nosotros
4731863 nosotros siempre tratamos de hacer un proyecto a la vez porque si hacemos muchos uno de ellos va a tropezar todo lo que hacemos lo queremos hacer bien y a su tiempo

4731873 poder jug rtela en tu estadio es una ventaja pero tambi n nosotros vamos a intentar all hacer gol como sea y mantener nuestra porter a a cero que es lo m s importante
4731874 ganas e ilusi n de volver a empezar y seguir rellenando el palmar s con t tulos que es lo que todo el mundo est deseando
4731875 la pasada temporada fui m s irregular tuve algunos altibajos y la verdad es que empiezo con muchas ganas e ilusi n despu s de un tiempo que he tenido para recuperar descansar y desconectar vengo nuevo con ganas de darlo todo de aportar much simo al equipo y de seguir creciendo como jugador que es lo que todo el mundo quiere
4731876 una competici n diferente y en la que todos los equipos se esfuerzan un poquito m s
4731877 tanto la copa del rey como la liga son muy importantes tambi n pero se vive de forma distinta el real madrid hace tiempo que no consigue una champions y creo que ser a algo important simo
4731878 hemos demostrado estos dos ltimos a os que han ido viniendo incorporaciones y poco a poco hemos ido creando un grupo bastante bueno tanto de gente veterana como de gente m s joven

4731955 general amherst was the guy that had blankets inoculated with small pox and had them given to native people as gifts
4731956 when it comes to linking specifically general amherst to the mikmaq we dont have any clear documentation that things like germ warfare were carried out

4731963 it might be a good policy for canada to recognize our people
4731964 but since it was established by the french why not give it the original french name i would be in favour of that
4731965 i guess anyone could potentially ask for a name change we would review it and determine if its appropriate
4731966 to have a place named after general amherst would be like having a city in jerusalem named after adolf hitler its disgusting
4731967 i dont generally comment on people who quote adolf hitler or make comparisons to him

4732017 hes part of history so is amherst nothing says that you have to idolize them phony history is not in the best interest of anybody
4732018 i know theres some people around that are gonna be difficult to deal with but i think were fighting the good fight and were gonna go with it til the end
4732019 its in no way a name that was selected to glorify or to honour a particular person its a name used by the british to name the fort and its now a historic place name that has been used for the last 250 years
4732020 i think fort amherst is fine i dont really know all the history all i can say is its just been fort amherst for so long
4732021 its been that way for centuries its just part of the local fabric fort amherst has been there as long as i can remember
4732022 it might be a good policy for canada to recognize our people
4732023 but since it was established by the french why not give it the original french name i would be in favour of that
4732024 i guess anyone could potentially ask for a name change we would review it and determine if its appropriate
4732025 to have a place named after general amherst would be like having a city in jerusalem named after adolf hitler its disgusting
4732026 i dont generally comment on people who quote adolf hitler or make comparisons to him
4732027 ma noo c anche la tre corsie non diciamo sciocchezze
4732028 verranno da tutto il mondo sar come le piramidi il colosseo
4732029 oh doctor i beg you please come with me my mother is surely dying shes as sick as she can be
4732030 but shes too sick so you must come or she will die i fear
4732031 how proud you must be of your wonderful little girl
4732032 but doctor my daughter died over three years ago is the picture on the wall of the little girl you know
4732033 gymnastics tells you no all day long it mocks you over and over again telling you youre an idiot that youre crazy if you like running fullspeed towards a stationary object vaults for you if you like pealing pieces of skin the size of quarters of your hands bars is for you because the only thing more fun then rips is when your rips get rips its super sexy and floor are you serious i mean who doesnt want to parade around in a leotard getting wedgies and doing dorky choreography its delicious if you like falling then gymnastics is the sport for you you get to fall on your face your ass your back your knees and your pride its a good thing i didnt like falling i loved it
4732034 elite gymnastics is like the navy seals only harder there are like 2000 navy seals there are only like 200 elite gymnasts guess thats because theres kids whos rather have a life than spend 6 hours a day training tricks that could kill you dont be fooled by the leotards people the things gymnasts do make navy seals look like wusses and we do them without a gun
4732035 a farmer went out to sow his seed 4 as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up 5 some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow 6 but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root 7 other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants 8 still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown 9 he who has ears let him hear
4732036 the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them
4732037 listen then to what the parable of the sower means 19 when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the seed sown along the path 20 the one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy 21 but since he has no root he lasts only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away 22 the one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful 23 but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
4732038 you deserve someone who isnt scared of life who knows when its time to change an aspect of the life thats bad and works for whats important
4732039 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4732040 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4732041 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4732042 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4732043 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4732044 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4732045 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4732046 you dont have the cleanest cab in la la land you got to live with it
4732047 youve got to make the best of it improvise adapt to the environment
4732048 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4732049 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4732050 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4732051 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4732052 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4732053 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4732054 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4732055 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4732056 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4732057 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4732058 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4732059 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4732060 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4732061 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4732062 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4732063 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4732064 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4732065 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4732066 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4732067 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4732068 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4732069 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4732070 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4732071 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4732072 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4732073 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4732074 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4732075 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4732076 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4732077 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4732078 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4732079 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4732080 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4732081 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4732082 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4732083 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4732084 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4732085 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4732086 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4732087 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4732088 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4732089 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4732090 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4732091 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4732092 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4732093 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4732094 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4732095 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4732098 certainly one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4732099 van mijn leraren op de middelbare school want op school leer je alles
4732100 maar die kinderen hebben recht op hun lessen ze begrijpen er vast niets van als ik ze niet mijn meesterlijke uitleg geef hier zijn ze niet klaar voor ze zijn pas een jaar of 14 zoveel zelfstandigheid kunnen ze niet aan

4732102 everyone suffers all because real estate agents buyers escrow offices and some banks got greedy now real estate brokers are crying because they cant sell anything its called payback
4732103 people dont like to say merry christmas because its got the word christ in it and after 2000 years hes still intimidatin people
4732104 how long am i going to stand here in forty degree weather and say nothing to her
4732105 i would rather be lonely when i am in fact im alone then be lonely when im not actualy alone but in a group of people my own age
4732106 ooh ooh should i say hi no ill just make a fool of myself because whenever i choose to talk it usually ends up being bad but when i dont talk its usually one of the times when i should have

4732134 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4732135 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4732136 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4732137 if im showing a picasso i want them to see a picasso
4732138 would you prefer a set curriculum or menu of choices as we have now as opposed to a system in which students with their advisors are responsible for demonstrating how they have achieved the goals the faculty has set forth

4732145 theyve already brought in legislation which means there can be no more awas so they have acted no one can complain about that
4732146 they brought that legislation in in march now theres a second stage of the legislation and theyre undertaking a serious round of consultations and thats to be welcomed
4732147 they are after all political animals and their first concern is a bit of leather in parliament house that they can put their bums on
4732148 and they must surely understand now after november 24 that there is this deep fundamental belief of the australian people to a fair industrial relations system which is going to provide adequate protection for workers
4732149 this means everything to me i never knew it was going to be like this i just got in there and did my best

4732154 the league of women voters is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential debate scheduled for mid october because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter
4732155 it has become clear to us that the candidates organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign trail charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions
4732156 the league has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the american public
4732157 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its stations with governments with an interest in receiving data of the situation in space

4732162 as children hit their teenage years general entertainment sites tend to make way for games focused sites which offer a massive range of easily accessible games and ensure that teenage gaming activity extends far beyond the ps3 wii and xbox consoles
4732163 its interesting to see that the sites with the heaviest concentration of young adults split into two conflicting groups functional and entertainment this mirrors the uneasy transition of growing up from teenage years into adulthood and the associated increase in responsibility whilst entertainment mainly through video sites still has a place this has been usurped by the need to investigate higher education and financing oneself through it
4732164 well as long as you show it ill keep kickin it

4732179 they deliberately refused to advise the people of omagh and district and elsewhere who had information to give it to the police
4732180 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
4732181 its a vivid illustration and a timely reminder of how unfit they are to hold any government office never mind their desire to get their hands upon policing and justice

4732417 buat besar lagi buat hari hari lagi besar dan lagi kerap kamu buat lagi benci rakyat kepada kamu senang sikit kerja kami tak perlu nak susah susah ceramah sana sini beritahu kepada rakyat siapa sebenarnya umno
4732418 kalau kita nak buat perhimpunan aman belum berhimpun dah kena tangkap tak jadi berhimpun pun kena tangkap tak berhimpun dan hanya bercakap kepada akhbar pun kena tangkap juga
4732419 kalau umno buat bukan sahaja polis tidak tangkap malah memberikan layanan terbaik polis mengkastakan rakyat
4732420 sikap polis terhadap umno itu akan menambahkan lagi undi kita dalam pilihan raya akan datang insya allah
4732421 ada yang undi pembangkang kerana benci kepada perdana menteri yang dituntut berundur datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi ada yang benci sangat kepada menantu abdullah khairy jamaluddin ada yang memang benci kepada umno dan bn barisan nasional ada yang meluat sangat kepada pengurusi suruhanjaya pilihan raya tan sri abdul rashid abdul rahman dan ramai yang benci polis
4732422 biar mereka buat banyak banyak hari hari umno ada demokrasi kan kita tak ada lagi pun orang orang umno di pulau pinang perak dan selangor sudah tak ada kerja sekarang buat demonstrasilah nak buat apa lagi
4732423 nak bela raja raja melayu konon dulu siapa yang buat perhimpunan di seluruh negara hentam raja raja melayu hari ini akhbar akhbar umno yang dahulunya menghentam dan menghina raja raja melayu berlagak sebagai pembela raja raja melayu kononnya
4732424 bila abdullah bunuh deb dasar ekonomi baru di wpi wilayah pembangunan iskandar mana muka muka itu mana melayu melayu itu kenapa tak demonstrasi masa itu rakyat sudah lama kenal siapa pembohong
4732425 tahun 1987 umno yang buat perhimpunan kami pembangkang yang kena tangkap dalam operasi lallang
4732426 kalau dengan pembangkang dibelasah habis habisan dengan cota tembakan dan semburan asid belum berhimpun kena tangkap tidak berhimpun pun kena tangkap kita nak tengok apa tindakan polis terhadap demonstrasi demonstrasi umno

4732428 apa yang berlaku dalam konteks saiful bukhari bersumpah memperlihatkan keganjilan bilamana sepatutnya yang bersumpah adalah pihak yang kena tuduh tetapi apa yang berlaku adalah pihak yang menuduh
4732429 mendengar saiful melibatkan memohon kepada allah melaknatinya beserta keluarga dan keturunannya tanpa menyebutkan berapa lama seolah olah sampai ke hari kiamat mana ada sumpah yang meminta allah melaknati keturunan
4732430 tidak sepatutnya keturunan yang akan mewarisi kita dilaknati allah bersama atas permintaan kita sedangkan mereka keluarga tidak melakukan kesalahan
4732431 saya tidak nampak ini suatu cara yang sebenarnya berlaku dalam hukum syarak
4732432 iaitu siapa yang menasihati dirinya sama ada orang politik atau siapa
4732433 ianya seolah olah tidak diprogramkan secara teliti dengan persiapan yang tidak cukup sehingga sampai ke peringkat menyebutkan kalimah sumpah pun tersasul
4732434 ianya dibuat secara tergesa gesa sebab dirujuk kepada orang yang benar benar mengetahui prosiding sumpah sperti ini atau mungkin saiful tidak diberi penerangan yang sejelas jelasnya tentang akibat sumpah
4732435 kenapa beliau tidak boleh menunggu sehingga proses mahkamah berjalan dan hukuman dijatuhkan dan apa kepentingan dirinya untuk bersumpah
4732436 kedua dua mereka saiful dan anwar baik yang menuduh atau yang dituduh meliwat hendaklah bermubahalah kerana inilah cara yang pernah nabi buat dulu

4732444 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
4732445 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
4732446 they need to be up to date otherwise they get left out and have low self esteem
4732447 it is often the children who you would expect to have least such as a family on benefits who have all the branded stuff and tease others
4732448 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
4732449 we are worried these pressures will further intensify as schools and colleges look for more help from commercial sponsors to provide it sports and science equipment teaching materials and food

4732451 court rulings like this over text messages and earlier ones facilitating polygamous marriages send a pretty clear message to men that they can treat women disrespectfully and get away with it

4732456 zo willen we de concurrentie aangaan met de bedrijven die al geruime tijd met zulke aanbiedingen aan de weg timmeren zoals de kabelmaatschappijen maar ook nieuwe concurrenten als microsoft skype en google
4732457 die wil de tarieven van internetplusbellen van kpn gaan reguleren met andere woorden we mogen als enige deze dienst niet te goedkoop maken dat zou sneu zijn voor onze concurrenten
4732458 alsof grootmachten als upc france telecom wanadoo en microsoft niet tegen een beetje concurrentie bestand zouden zijn er is geen land in europa waar meer concurrentie is dan nederland maar er is ook geen land in europa waar meer regulering is dat is vreemd

4732482 want de regering van de franse gemeenschap wil niet meedoen
4732483 de topvorm is er ik heb me nog nooit zo goed gevoeld dit seizoen
4732484 ik heb het volste vertrouwen in mijn coach lieve van mechelen red zij zorgt er altijd voor dat ik op het juiste moment klaar ben en inderdaad iedere keer bam het komt eruit ik ben 110 maar waar dat me brengt is moeilijk te voorspellen het is een sprintnummer v r het wk in osaka had ik de 32ste tijd en ik werd 13de ik probeer gewoon opnieuw top 16 maar zal daarvoor harder uit mijn pijp moeten komen dan in osaka want iedereen is nog scherper dan vorig jaar het slechtste scenario voor mij is dat ik er in de kwartfinales uitga
4732485 qua tijd is mijn doel 20 30 maar om dat te lopen moet alles goed zitten in de reeksen zal dat waarschijnlijk niet lukken want ik ben niet echt een ochtendmens aan het record van stevens denk ik niet dat is nog te ver voor mij
4732486 voor een gebrek aan frisheid op de 4x400 m moet ik echter niet bang zijn zelfs als ik de finale loop op de 200 m zit er nog een dag tussen ik heb alle trainingen meegedaan met het team maar we hebben het voor mij wel wat aangepast in yantai hebben zij nog op weerstand getraind maar we hebben een gulden middenweg gevonden zo kon ik mijn dingen doen maar toch meetrainen met hen wat belangrijk was voor de groepssfeer

4732497 ive learned so much over the course of this film
4732498 the dartmoor film has taken its own trajectory and other films have grown out of it as a response to what people have said its been an embryonic project that could lead to other things like a film on the history of tin mining or the quarrying industry or even more of the landscape and its people

4732504 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests against the touring england squad and that will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4732505 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4732506 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league twenty20 will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered

4732531 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4732551 its going to be tough against him the last time we met it was too close to call and he balakshin managed to sneak past riding on his luck but this time i am better prepared
4732552 of course teams with a player down injured can choose to put the ball out of play but they shouldnt expect to get the ball back
4732553 this protocol has now been adopted by the fa and uefa in their competitions as well so players and fans should get used to play being waved on by referees
4732554 last season there were a few issues concerning the offside law we have made a video explaining this law and have given examples of this law in action and why a particular example is offside and why another example is not
4732555 every referee assistant referee and every manager will be given a copy of this video i show the video at our meetings and then they take a copy away with them this hopefully will explain every aspect of the offside law
4732556 what we have decided to do is ban all monitors and laptops from the technical area
4732557 often if there was a controversial decision made by the referee managers could look at a replay and if they felt a decision was wrong would go up to the fourth official and let them know that is not the job of the fourth official
4732558 the laptops can act as a trigger during the game if a manager believes a referee has made a mistake he will take it out on the fourth official and this sends out a message if they want to discuss it after the game then they can do so when everyone has calmed down it is also about looking at the image of the game a manager berating an official is not the best image for the game
4732559 at present some players take it off while others strap it up now all players will be asked to remove it otherwise they will not be allowed to play it is purely for safety reasons

4732654 im bored with all this crap on your comments page can you please tell me what the problem is with people believing in the prince of peace or a benevolent force of love good are you really afraid that people just plain old believe in good versus evil i know there are plenty of twisted psychos but what about the ones who believe for the sake of benevolence i try to be objective yes even to good old darwinism homosexuality as a means of population control anybody but for some reason i am not sure why someone would argue against a force of benevolence perhaps i havent been reading long enough your turn

4732656 in business and in life you need to learn how to talk you must be tactful and you must learn to address issues head on especially if you ever plan on being an executive if an issue arises talk about the issue from your perspective allow the other person to talk about the issue from their perspective and then draw a line once you draw the line start new from there you see if you move on without addressing the issue the issue will still be there and it will begin to grow it will always be in your heads and ultimately it will affect the relationship so if there is an issue talk about it life is too short and from a business perspective time is money so learn to talk now open your books to chapter 8 lol

4732695 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4732696 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation
4732697 everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4732698 but in this case i want to be very clear
4732699 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4732700 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4732701 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4732702 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
4732703 everybody has been talking and it is clear that i am being blamed for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4732704 in this case i want to be clear since i talked with martin oneill in april i havent talked with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4732705 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4732706 i just want to clarify because every time people say oh you were doing this i talked to martin oneill in april and after this i was not in charge
4732707 i talked just with martin oneill i havent had any contact with the owner or the chief executive of aston villa i havent talked with martin oneill since april
4732708 if you want to talk about players talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then talk to me
4732709 we do have some problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4732710 i think we need something on the left but anyway i will continue to try and improve and progress with the players that i have
4732711 i want to be clear i dont have any problem any problem with the owners so i am not talking about anything like this its just that i will try to improve the squad
4732712 we have players in mind i dont think it will be a problem to find players
4732713 the question is to find the right players for us the right left footed players for us i was in contact with the owners and they told me that we had some money i think enough to get the player we want its not a problem i feel we can progress

4732737 there were a couple of clubs interested in me one in italy but more than anything i wanted to come here to play english football especially after the success english clubs have had in europe and im also really keen to learn english
4732738 if the manager decides to play me its not a big risk for the team
4732739 for me personally i dont consider it a risk because ive got to play my first match somewhere so why not sunday
4732740 ive been warned about it and its going to be different to the way the game was in spain but ive experienced that when i went form argentina to spain
4732741 the first few matches can be difficult but after that i soon got used to it
4732742 it was the first thing he said to me when we met there are a lot of players in argentina like this with long hair
4732743 i am delighted that the deal is now done fabricio has got tremendous experience and is a full international with argentina that tells you he is a player of the very highest quality
4732744 hes a very athletic player he played every minute in the league for his club last season and hes also very versatile
4732745 i do not think we keegan and ashley have been closer than we are now
4732746 mike ashley has come out and said in his own words how he sees the club where he is with the club and that was a good thing to do because it stopped all this well he is thinking of selling talk
4732747 if you talk to mike about this club he is really committed to it
4732748 i think he would be the first to tell you he does not understand everything about football because he is a fan but i w o u l d guarantee what he does not know he will learn very quickly
4732749 he is very sharp very observant does not miss a trick when you are in meetings if someone tells him then doesnt say quite the same thing again he will pick up on it i have had that happen to me as well
4732750 i think we are a long way from there now we all understand what each others briefs are and what each of us brings to the club and that is a good thing
4732751 six or seven guys in a room talking about football are never ever going to agree on everything but the important thing is when we dont agree it stays in the room
4732752 we are very much united as far as i am concerned i am sure if you ask dennis wise tony jiminez jeff vetere mike ashley and derek llambias they would say the same thing
4732753 we still have some way to go because rome wasnt built in a day
4732754 when we wrap up this period with the transfer deadline then the supporters will see where we are
4732755 we have just broken our record for a defender and you know that sends out a message and i do not think he will be the last player to come in here by a long way
4732756 in those days we knew we were building a club we would have to dismantle again
4732757 now the sort of players we are getting in you know there is not a risk to them when we were starting off in the very early days here we were buying players that we knew would probably have to leave the club if we went up
4732758 then when we got up we started to head hunt players more guys like alan shearer and it was very very exciting i think we are back at that stage now
4732759 but at the end of the day we have to communicate better to them through you the press and our own websites
4732760 i think the proof of the pudding is always in the eating when we wrap up this period with the transfer deadline they will see where we are
4732761 we have just broken our record for a defender fabricio coloccini and you know that sends out a message i do not think he will be the last player to come in but if we are going to fetch a new player let them be quality
4732762 for people who have not been associated with the club for very long the likes of danny guthrie and fabricio coloccini it astounds them
4732763 but when you have been here like i have you know the problems at this football club have never been the crowd and theyve never been the passion of the people and the support of the club in the city
4732764 that has always been there through thin thin and thin again the fans are top rate and my job is to get a team that eventually matches them it is a tough ask
4732765 yes were going to the home of the european champions and the champions of this country but i think it is a good place to go and some times teams go there and win
4732766 we have to believe we can be one of those teams
4732767 we have just broken our record for a defender and you know that sends out a message and i do not think he will be the last player to come in here by a long way

4732770 queens park rangers boss iain dowies days at loftus road are numbered according to readers of eurosport yahoo com

4732774 it relies on contributions from the vice president and other bodies to keep it alive money is so incredibly tight that ive got to get a return for anything i pay out running costs include coach travel to away games to hiring training facilities at northolt school
4732775 the calibre of players is also affected ive had some managers keen to offer me players but they know we have no money they dont want to push players our way as they know they cant get anything for playing
4732776 we dont have the strength and depth and what i need is players who can deliver more on a consistent basis rather than flashes of brilliance now and again
4732777 if we get anywhere near the gate we had last season i will be happy
4732778 the money from that game took us up to christmas on the budget covering our 1 000 a week running costs if we can do that again this year it would be brilliant
4732779 there are a lot of qpr fans in the area and this will almost be more of a home game for them than at loftus road it is just unfortunate the game comes after they have started their season but it was the only date we could both play on
4732780 it doesnt matter whether they bring a team with players for the future or include players returning from injury you can see the size of their squad and the quality of players they are signing it will be a relaxed atmosphere at earlsmead and the fans will be able to get autographs at the end

4732816 the new lighting aware system adds additional layers of lenses and screens to add two more dimensions of change the image that is seen is then not only based on the position of the viewer but also on the direction of the illumination

4732845 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof
4732846 in the temple as i said earlier also they gave all the materials and also notes on all the songs the story as well i will post the story also soon but here comes the song for the aarathi
4732847 i would like my blog to be visible only to users i choose
4732848 oasis the musical has got to happen at some point five lads who shook manchester roll with it the musical ben eltons got to have six months on his own soon he can write it then
4732849 i met jeremy kyle when i was in the granada studios in manchester doing something and he came up to me with a completely straight face and said when are we going to get you and your brother on the show
4732850 i mean i done drugs for 18 years 365 days in a row for 18 years and i never got that bad i would go you know i think kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4732851 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
4732852 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4732853 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4732854 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4732855 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4732856 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4732857 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4732858 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4732859 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4732860 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4732861 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4732862 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4732863 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4732864 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4732865 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4732866 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4732867 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4732868 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4732869 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4732870 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4732871 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4732872 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4732873 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4732874 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4732875 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4732876 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4732877 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4732878 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4732879 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4732880 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4732881 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4732882 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4732883 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4732884 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4732885 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4732886 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4732887 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4732888 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4732889 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4732890 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4732891 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4732892 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4732893 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4732894 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4732895 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4732896 this is a planning took where all things are going
4732897 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4732898 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4732899 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4732900 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4732901 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4732902 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4732903 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4732904 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4732905 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4732906 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4732907 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4732908 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4732909 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4732910 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4732911 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4732912 in english grammar study is artificial we know the language already and have no real need to dissect it while in latin we must master the grammar in order to understand the language at all and the study is therefore spontaneous again if our object is to train exactness of thought modern languages are far inferior to latin which has in a unique degree in a degree no modern language exhibits that logical quality of which so much is said in these discussions he the roman disciplined his thought as he disciplined himself his words are drilled as rigidly as were his legions and march with the same regularity and precision modern languages and english most of all are lax and individualistic in our grammar as in our politics we are nonconforming dissenting lenient we have almost as many exceptions as rules in the ideal language law is supreme reason governs its grammar and the expression is exactly measured and fitted to the thought which it expresses latin is such a language
4732913 i was watching things like world of warcraft take off and spending way too much time with my fantasy football team
4732914 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4732915 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4732916 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4732917 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4732918 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4732919 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4732920 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4732921 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4732922 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4732923 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4732924 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4732925 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4732926 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4732927 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4732928 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4732929 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4732930 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4732931 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4732932 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4732933 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4732934 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4732935 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4732936 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4732937 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4732938 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4732939 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4732940 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4732941 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4732942 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4732943 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4732944 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4732945 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4732946 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4732947 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4732948 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4732949 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4732950 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4732951 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4732952 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4732953 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4732954 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4732955 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4732956 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4732957 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4732958 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4732959 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4732960 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4732961 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4732962 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4732963 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4732964 it is not reasonable for a modern and advanced society to establish stereotypes of beauty that are far removed from the social reality of a community
4732965 it is everyones commitment that beauty and health go hand in hand
4732966 promote a healthy physical image that conforms with the reality of the spanish population

4732968 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4732969 most russians dont care whether they are ruled by fascists or communists or even martians as long as they can buy six kinds of sausage in the store and lots of cheap vodka

4732974 we have asked him to pay the fine or it would not be possible for us to retain him in champions trophy squad
4732975 there is no court order saying he should not pay the fine even if the court upholds his petition against the ban and fine it will be refunded to him but he has to pay the fine now

4732985 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share i dont stay here anymore

4732987 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship i do understand that my baby made this monster but when she was down people took advantage
4732988 empire today was founded in 1959 and has grown from a small family owned chicago business into one of north americas leading providers of installed home furnishings and home improvements
4732989 to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4732990 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4732991 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4732992 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4732993 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4732994 they probably will be the third team in our group
4732995 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday
4732996 als galilei mit einem selbst gebauten teleskop entdeckt hatte da der planet jupiter von monden umgeben ist sprach man ihm diese tatsache ab denn sie stand in krassem widerspruch zu den lehren des aristoteles ber die planetenbewegungen die anh nger der aristotelischen lehre waren nicht bereit durch das fernrohr zu blicken da in dem weltbild des aristoteles keine monde vorkommen konnten widerspr che zu diesem weltbild gab es bereits vorher galilei jedoch war konsequent genug um mit dieser vorstellung zu brechen dies genau ist es was die physik oder den physiker auszeichnet die bereitschaft von den berlieferten vorstellungen abzugehen wenn die beobachtung dieser widerspricht
4732997 bei richtiger nutzung sollten physik und technik auch einen entscheidenden anteil an der entwicklung neuer humanit tsprinzipien haben leider gibt es noch immer vorurteile und ideologien au erhalb des naturwissenschaftlichen denkens die eine solche fortentwicklung behindern

4733029 of course disease producing micro organisms are always present but usually they can be fought off successfully however some individuals never get sick while others pick up every cold in the neighborhood so although the germ may be one of the essential and contributing causes it alone is not sufficient to produce illness
4733030 germs are agents of disease agents of disease are not causes of disease agents of disease do not cause us to get sick they are merely potential vectors of illness waiting for chances to do their mischief given a chance they will do it chances come along because of the natural fluctuations of our cycles of relative health agents of disease are all around us not only in the form of viruses bacteria and parasites but as a multitude of potential irritants such as carcinogenic chemicals allergens insects toxic plants and so forth a person solidly equilibrated in a phase of relative health can often interact with these agents and not get sick since internal factors determine the nature of our relationships with them the true causes of disease are internal
4733031 this principle suggests other ways of thinking about prevention and treatment than those predominant in conventional medicine rather than warring on disease agents with the hope vain i suspect of eliminating them we ought to worry more about strengthening resistance to them and learning to live in balance with them more of the time
4733032 the science of chiropractic has modified our views concerning life death health and disease we no longer believe that disease is an entity something foreign to the body which may enter from without and with which we have to grasp struggle fight and conquer or submit and succumb to its ravages disease is a disturbed condition not a thing of enmity disease is an abnormal performance of certain functions the abnormal activity has its causes
4733033 disease is abnormal performance of certain functions the abnormal activity has its causes
4733034 should be examined and if required specifically adjusted the success of the adjustment over shadows every other type of treatment
4733035 the maintenance of health should take precedence over the treatment of disease

4733040 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4733041 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows

4733053 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4733054 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4733055 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4733056 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4733057 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4733058 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4733059 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4733060 when it left my hand it felt good and i was jut glad it went in
4733061 it was tough defense against cdr and he might have gotten the best of me but we still got the win
4733062 we made so many plays down the stretch and got the ball into our most cluth players hands and he delivered
4733063 she declared affectionately sitting herself down very slowly as if she intended not only to sit down but to demonstrate to me how it was that one sat oneself down
4733064 please do not feel anxious on my account for your eccentricities i assure you they are nothing compared with my own and yours have such life and warmth such sincerity in them while mine are only dry and obscure yours fulfil a need but mine only exist to pass the time
4733065 hoewel het lonend is om de goed scorende spelers in het spel te houden baseren de kandidaten van shafted hun keuze waarschijnlijk onbewust ook op uiterlijk
4733066 deelnemers die worden beschouwd als het minst aantrekkelijk maken twee keer zo veel kans om door hun medespelers uit de show te worden gezet terwijl ze gemiddeld niet slechter scoren dan aantrekkelijke kandidaten
4733067 shorter term applications of the things we have demonstrated i would say we can use it for very high resolution to image tiny objects
4733068 even if you take a very small object and you magnify by say 100 000 you will see a magnified image but you wont see the fine detail you will get a blurred image
4733069 a three dimensional array of electronic elements such as capacitors and inductors the common elements you will find in your radio or televison but with a nanometer scale so that it can interact with light
4733070 the metamaterials achieved by our group have the potential to beat this limit and to image very small objects such as living cells in their natural environment this would be of practical importance for medical science
4733071 we are still learning how to make 3 dimensional metamaterial lenses and how to reduce the effect of losses on imaging resolution
4733072 metamaterials enable for example the development of small multi antenna terminals that are needed in many of these wireless platforms
4733073 moreover metamaterials are very well suited for creating devices that operate at multiple bands which is another immediate requirement in emerging wireless systems

4733078 i am looking forward to the season because i think rafa benitez has put together his best squad yet
4733079 i think we may do something this year a realistic aim is to win the league title i mean that
4733080 people say we need to beat the top teams and yes we do

4733088 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4733089 for me the draw is the second option because we will be going to ibrox to win
4733090 if we can win its an opportunity to say we are good and we can follow this road
4733091 this is an easy game if we lose no one is saying we are a bad team but if we win everyone will say we are the best because we have beaten rangers at home
4733092 we have respect for rangers but we are not afraid of them
4733093 if everything settles down at the club they have the capability to be up there with some of the best teams in the league and theyre capable of beating any team in the league
4733094 all clubs start with a bit optimism unless you get knocked out of europe and hearts have been like that
4733095 if they do get a bit of impetus going they can be a very dangerous team
4733096 our vision is to offer our customers more options and solutions in the straits of gibraltar giving them a competitive edge in world markets the new terminal expands our global terminal portfolio in one of the worlds most important shipping lanes
4733097 moroccos proximity to europes 400 million consumer market will create a new gateway to trade
4733098 we have worked closely with the government of morocco through the tangier mediterranean special agency tmsa established in order to secure interest from the worlds leading operators and fast track overall project timeline and with our partner the akwa group to build and deliver on time this new container terminal we are creating new jobs and opportunities bringing in foreign investment and starting a new chapter in the west mediterranean market
4733099 the opening of tanger med ports first container terminal according to the timeline displays moroccos capacity to implement large scale infrastructural projects in a due manner it also highlights the quality of the partnership between tanger med port authority and its world class partner apm terminals our vision is to take advantage of tanger med ports key location at the crossroads of east west and north south maritime routes while partnering with leaders in the field to benefit from their world class services and international best operational practices the launch of the activities of the first container terminal is setting the ground for tanger med port to become an important container hub leading to the development of a successful large scale logistic and industrial platform in the north of morocco

4733101 we have been using our surpluses to deliver record infrastructure programs which are breathing life into wa
4733102 those programs include two of the biggest infrastructure programs in the states history the perth to mandurah railway delivered debt free and the new fiona stanley hospital which will also be delivered debt free
4733103 at the same time we have been steadily reducing the states debt levels
4733104 you dont suddenly get up one morning and discover you can save 1 5 billion
4733105 either the government has been wasting millions of dollars of taxpayers money over recent years or there are cuts that will be made to government programs that for political reasons they are too afraid to provide any details
4733106 there is three weeks to go in the campaign there will be a number of announcements between now and election day
4733107 shes done it before in a different way because she was discovered on a show like this

4733117 wahai rasulullah apakah engkau masih mengerjakan ibadah seperti ini padahal bukankah engkau telah diampuni dosa dosanya
4733118 dan apa saja nikmat yang ada pada kamu maka dari allah lah datangnya dan bila kamu ditimpa oleh kemudharatan maka hanya kepadanyalah kamu meminta pertolongan
4733119 syukur adalah kamu tidak menggunakan sesuatu apa pun dari nikmat nikmat allah untuk keperluan bermaksiat kepada nya
4733120 ya rabbku berikanlah aku kesanggupan untuk dapat mengingat mu dan bersyukur kepada mu serta dapat melakukan ibadah kepada engkau dengan sebaik baiknya

4733125 you and i are told we must choose between a left or right but i suggest there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to mans age old dream the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motives those who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward path
4733126 once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition it has only one way to go and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear
4733127 all censorships exist to prevent anyone from challenging current conceptions and existing institutions all progress is initiated by challenging current conceptions and executed by supplanting existing institutions consequently the first condition of progress is the removal of censorships there is the whole case against censorships in a nutshell
4733128 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man

4733158 the renowned shaykh hakeem akhtar hafizahullah states in one of his poems that
4733159 its clear that obamas economic policies arent a continuation of the bush era but what they are remains a hard to summarize mix of moderate democratic standbys populist silliness and the occasional truly visionary proposal
4733160 it is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective but to achieve this end it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for developement and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence since one cannot do otherwise the violence which denies these means to the workers
4733161 growing divide between the wealthy and the not so wealthy
4733162 libertarian socialism is a group of political philosophies that aim to create a society without political economic or social hierarchies a society in which all violent or coercive institutions would be dissolved and in their place every person would have free equal access to tools of information and production or a society in which such coercive institutions and hierarchies were drastically reduced in scope
4733163 libertarian socialists believe that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have an equal amount of bargaining power that an accumulation of economic power in the hands of a few and the centralization of political power both reduce the bargaining power and thus the liberty of the other individuals in society

4733170 when he painted tanneke she stood there happily pouring milk for months without a thought passing through that head god love her
4733171 from may to november 1988 i worked for an abortionist he specializes in third trimester killings i witnessed evidence of the brutal cold blooded murder of over 600 viable healthy babies at seven eight and nine months gestation a very very few of these babies less than 2 were handicapped i thought i was pro choice and i was glad to be working in an abortion clinic i thought i was helping provide a noble service to women in crisis i was instructed to falsify the age of the babies in medical records i was required to lie to the mothers over the phone as they scheduled their appointments and to tell them that they were not too far along then i had to note in the records that dr tillers needle had successfully pierced the walls of the babys heart injecting the poison what brought death one day dr tiller came up the stairs from the basement where the mothers were in labor he was carrying a large cardboard box and ducked into the employees only area of the office so that he wouldnt have to walk through the waiting room he passed behind my desk as i sat working on the computer and he turned the corner to go around a short hall he called out for me to come and help him the box was so big and heavy in his arms that he couldnt get the key into the lock so i unlocked the door for him and pushing the door open i saw very clearly the gleaming metal of the crematorium a full sized crematorium just like the ones used in funeral homes i went back to my computer i could hear dr tiller firing up the gas oven a few minutes later i could smell burning human flesh mine was the agony of a participant however reluctant in the act of prenatal infanticide

4733175 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4733176 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4733177 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4733187 in the 4th century b c hippocrates actually stated that the human is composed of 4 different type of liquid
4733188 and he categorised people according to the composition of these fluids in the body
4733189 and so you have it the different composition of these fluids in the human body according to him affect your health and your mental condition these was his postulation which was obviously wrong but nowadays this term was used to categories people into four different group according to their personality

4733206 a lot of the heartbeat of miami beach is living on the venetian causeway
4733207 there arent mcmansions on every single piece of land and there are affordable properties on many of the islands
4733208 the venetians have not had the hype of other areas in miami beach and they dont need it
4733209 the venetians are hot i think the hottest area of miami
4733210 theres still an upside here you can get luxury properties at under 10 million thats true nowhere else on miami beach
4733211 there is a sense that things here did not shoot up like crazy to begin with
4733212 the area has gotten looser with a little bit of a bohemian aspect to it
4733213 so the place provides stability if you will and a feeling of neighborhood
4733214 almost a living room for the community attracting not just travelers but local residents

4733269 we were at the pb patrol base when the ana afghan national army were out on their routine patrol and radioed through to us say taliban had been seen in the area
4733270 so we crashed out of the pb and down to where we thought they would be we came into direct contact with them in an open field it was in an area south of musa qaleh
4733271 in a split second something hit my chest and i blacked out for a time my osprey body armour took all the damage i was hit with an rocket propelled machine gun
4733272 fortunately no one else was injured it was a lucky escape but its one of those things
4733273 i have only been down there for about three weeks after my r amp r and this happened in about the third week
4733274 i was patrolling the compounds and i was the second man in the patrol the taliban came straight in front of the first man in the patrol they both started firing at the same time and he dropped
4733275 i was running past them to get under cover and i was hit
4733276 i have shrapnel in my chest and a bullet in my shoulder its the first time ive been injured but its not too bad its just one of those things that happen ive been out of action for a couple of weeks now but im getting ready to go back out there
4733277 there may be a bit of scarring on my shoulder but nothing major
4733278 alan gave it everything and to be leading the olympic final through 750 metres was a great achievement

4733280 no one i repeat no one who has experienced deep suffering will underestimate the power it has
4733281 it can blind individuals to reason it can cause them to cry out for revenge it can tear communities apart
4733282 how can it be managed some would say that justice is the answer and indeed we should always seek for justice
4733283 however we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice
4733284 with justice as with so many other things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute
4733285 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4733286 it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the childrens welfare is in jeopardy
4733287 for thousands of years russians and georgians have been living together and now we have war and innocent people are dying it was all started by politicians and i dont understand why
4733288 i landed in the forest and didnt lose consciousness but i couldnt move shortly afterwards a first aid team came to me and gave me different medicines then i was transferred here
4733289 she said there will be peace and i believe her
4733290 i have only the best things to say about the way i have been treated
4733291 they spoke with me and told me that if they were taken to a hospital in russia they wouldnt get such good treatment
4733292 but we plan to proceed as usual in such cases and exchange these pilots for georgian military personnel captured by the russian army

4733297 anderlecht heeft een serieuze knal gekregen maar ik denk dat het zich heel snel zal herstellen
4733298 en het kan er volledig voor gaan want het heeft alleen maar die competitie
4733299 de match tegen cercle wordt moreel erg belangrijk bij winst zal alles meteen doorgespoeld zijn
4733300 maar op 34 duels zal n wedstrijd niet doorslaggevend zijn
4733301 maar tegen liverpool was ieder n goed en gemotiveerd en scherp op zn niveau van woensdag is standard in belgi buiten categorie
4733302 maar na verloop van tijd kan de situatie liverpool voorbij zijn
4733303 en tegen een mindere tegenstander is de concentratie misschien al wat minder
4733304 ach als b l ni resultaten haalt en het spel van tegen liverpool blijft brengen hoor ik weinig over michel praten maar zodra het wat minder gaat zal dat anders zijn
4733305 het heeft zijn kern redelijk goed bijeen gehouden en heeft met dirar en vargas creativiteit in huis gehaald dirar was goed bij westerlo maar wat kan hij op dit niveau
4733306 voor preudhomme heeft gent een serieuze financi le inspanning gedaan dat had het misschien beter ook wat in spelers gestoken
4733307 gent wil zo snel mogelijk aansluiting met de top drie maar met de huidige spelersgroep heb ik daar toch nog mijn twijfels over
4733308 racing genk heeft in tegenstelling tot andere jaren een redelijk rustige aanloop gehad het heeft zich op drie vier plaatsen hopelijk goed versterkt
4733309 genk opnieuw bij de top bijf zou een verademing voor belgi zijn
4733310 ik hoop dat cercle zijn uitstekende seizoen kan bevestigen de komst van buffel is uiteraard ook commercieel een heel goeie zet alleen moet nu nog blijken wat zijn rendement zal zijn aanvallend is de ploeg versterkt verdedigend niet echt vorig jaar liep alles goed maar hoe zal het reageren als het toch eens tegenzit
4733311 in de jaren 60 en 70 was het een bloeiende industrietak
4733312 maar nu zijn er weinig jongeren bereid om nog te investeren in de sector
4733313 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4733314 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4733315 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4733316 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4733317 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4733318 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4733319 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4733320 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4733321 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out friday will definitely be a much better day this week but we want to keep building on the momentum
4733322 i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
4733323 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4733324 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization
4733325 you still have to keep in mind that if you take a chance and dont finish a race that youll lose a lot of points and the 10 bonus points for a win you thought you might gain for the chase wont happen either
4733326 you have to do the same things that have gotten you to victory lane in the past you cant afford to take too many unnecessary chances
4733327 my brother kurt moved up to michigan years ago to run in the craftsman truck series and he went to a michigan game
4733328 he bought me a michigan sweat shirt and sent it home for me i never really paid attention to college football until then but i became a michigan fan
4733329 not too complicated of a story but its fun to be able to follow them when i have a saturday afternoon off in the fall i was lucky enough to be able to go to their practice last fall and get to know a few of the guys you always respect people who are as competitive as you are and they certainly have the same drive to win that i do
4733330 there is a lot more stress in making the chase than there is in the chase itself most of these tracks in the chase you have been to once already this season and have a baseline of what to expect there are good tracks for us in the chase like lowes motor speedway and talladega

4733367 to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4733368 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4733369 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4733370 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4733371 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4733372 they probably will be the third team in our group
4733373 estava indo para o balizamento dos 50 m livre e o phelps voltando do p dio dos 100 borboleta quando ele me disse mostrando a medalha est vendo essa aqui foi por um cent simo poe a m o na parede a porque isso pode fazer voc ganhar ou ficar em quarto na prova

4733382 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4733383 it hadnt been my best season but i saved my best performance for the games
4733384 i guess just believing in yourself goes a long way
4733385 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet

4733390 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4733391 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4733392 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4733393 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4733394 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4733395 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4733396 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

4733422 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income

4733454 that wicked walter suggested last year but just some shots of various parts of our academic worlds
4733455 when hes played stephen jordan seems to have taken up the mantle at centre half and left back as well
4733456 he was in and out of the side last season for one reason and another and it might have been a transitional period coming from a club like manchester city to burnley but hes fit and raring to go looks focused and has been playing really well during pre season
4733457 hes played at centre half a couple of times this summer and looked thoroughly competent there
4733458 and when he and michael duff played at centre half together during pre season it looked so easy for the pair of them
4733459 that lets me and steven caldwell know theres a big fight for all positions this season everyone wants to be in the side and it shows we want to be part of the team and part of the squad
4733460 remcos excellent at holding in front of the back four breaking things up and distributing the ball
4733461 christian looks fit and very athletic and hes got a real penchant for going forward and overlapping the wingers so that adds an exciting dimension to the team
4733462 the gaffers trying to play different formations and the early signs have been encouraging because it gives our attacking players a lot of links to go and create as long as we can lock the back door in thats great
4733463 the strikers are professional enough and fit enough to know the shape to fall back to and help us out at any given opportunity
4733464 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4733465 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4733466 it is time for liverpool to make their move in the
4733467 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years
4733468 weaknesses are exposed in that time frame and dealt with
4733469 it is impossible to win the championship without a world class goalkeeper and a world class striker and liverpool have both
4733470 son you may not be able to buy the best clothes but always keep those you have clean that is the important thing
4733471 why dont you throw that old wool hat away and get a nice cool straw hat
4733472 me wear a straw hat i would never let my horses see me in a straw hat
4733473 what have horses to do with a straw hat animals dont care what kind of hat you wear
4733474 my horses recognize me because i always wear the same hat and they like cowboy hats best of all anyway
4733475 i would not be seen dead in a straw hat
4733476 just look at most of the ranchers we know all of them wear heavy wool cowboy hats in the summer and most of them have lost their hair
4733477 it was not a cowboy hat that made jim berry lose his hair it was his wife always talking about hats and not giving him any peace and quiet
4733478 now listen to me mama understand this i will never wear a straw hat or any other kind of hat my horses do not like
4733479 disqualify me even as a shameless hack writer peddling dollar a page drivel but the thing about me is im an oily creep and i dont give a
4733480 abdoulaye is a fantastic player with top flight experience in abundance
4733481 we have worked extremely hard to conclude the deal and we are absolutely delighted to have signed a player of his quality
4733482 the closer we get the bigger the buzz around the place and the players are really looking forward to it
4733483 were all hoping it will be a great day for the club and our fans
4733484 we go back to 1972 when his dad don gave me my league debut at bristol rovers and gary was a little lad of 13 or 14
4733485 he did a smashing job last season and i dont think he got the credit he deserved for keeping bolton up
4733486 i havent spoken to gary for two weeks but ill probably text him to make sure hes got some nice wine in mind you hes a tight beggar
4733487 a lot of pundits are saying stoke and hull are certain to get relegated we will just keep quiet and get on with the job
4733488 we went soft at times last season especially at the start
4733489 we need to get back to what we were what we showed in the last five games
4733490 if we let stoke win the battle then we may as well give up the points they will come at us for the opening 20 minutes and if we can survive that then we can go on and hopefully win the game
4733491 these things i have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full
4733492 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor coarse jesting which are not fitting but rather giving of thanks
4733493 my names not meerschaum and if im not mistaken yours is not holmes
4733494 if im not mistaken the games afoot come on there is no time to lose we will need fresh provisions perhaps one of mrs miggins pork pies were off to the docks
4733495 get yourself across to baker street post haste and see inspector lestrade tell him to meet me at butlers wharf at precisely thirteen minutes past three oclock
4733496 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4733497 we have decided we will take all our types of cluster bombs out of service
4733498 of course we welcome the intention of a whole array of nations to renounce the use of cluster munitions as a means of warfare we understand the motives behind this decision
4733499 in march and april 2003 u s and british forces used almost 13 000 cluster munitions containing nearly 2 million submunitions that killed or wounded more than 1 000 civilians

4733556 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4733557 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4733558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4733559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4733560 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4733568 things have obviously changed again around the club since the new boss took charge
4733569 it is not massively different but there are little things that have changed especially around the training ground

4733574 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4733575 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question

4733608 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4733609 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4733610 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4733611 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4733612 i have come to share the joy of this country for the new era that begins with lugo
4733613 the church has shown me how the poor live in this country
4733614 that inspires me to work on behalf of this class that is so demeaned so abandoned so forgotten
4733615 today begins the story of a paraguay whose authorities and people will be implacably against the countrys thieves
4733616 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4733617 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4733618 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied
4733619 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4733620 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4733621 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4733622 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4733623 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4733624 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4733625 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4733626 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4733627 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4733628 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4733629 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4733630 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4733631 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4733632 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4733633 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4733634 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4733635 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4733636 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4733637 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4733638 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4733639 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4733640 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4733641 fatah has showed its readiness to join a national committee to resolve the issue of political arrests by setting up a mechanism to release the prisoners

4733660 on my hikes i met people who claimed to have had ghostly encounters so i began exploring the history behind the stories i was hearing on the trail
4733661 they were taking a track log of the track i needed
4733662 these guys winter hiked a lot while they were camping they heard the sound of someone crying and shrieking and didnt know what it was all they could imagine was that it was a bird but there were no birds to be found
4733663 their history is what makes those spirits alive the people who originally built these places and brought them to life their stories are already part of the land waiting to be rediscovered by families and children

4733689 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4733690 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4733691 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4733692 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4733693 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4733694 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4733695 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4733696 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4733697 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4733698 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4733699 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4733700 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4733701 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4733702 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4733703 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4733704 la propuesta es que yo me responsabilice que me haga cargo de m que yo termine adue ndome para siempre de mi vida
4733705 not an option last year i asked internal security minister avi dichter to include jaffa in the u0027city without violence u0027 project and
4733706 criteria u0022 u00c2 u00a0 kamal agbaria chairman of the neighborhood committee for jaffa u0027s ajami and jabaliya neighborhoods in jaffa added u0022i am shocked and

4733710 there was quite a bit of violence at the pool on the arab residents part and we had to figure out what to do
4733711 its a city pool and we want people to come here with their children have a good time and enjoy some peace and quiet it got to the point where violence was the order of the day and police presence at the pool was a common sight
4733712 several of the residents decided to come together and carry out a symbolic gesture so that the jewish families could enjoy themselves in a relaxed atmosphere
4733713 i hate to say this i wish the arab residents could join us and enjoy the pool with us while keeping the peace but thats just not happening theyre looking to cause trouble and thats a shame
4733714 none whatsoever they have the rest of the week for themselves to use the pool they show up whenever they want we are the ones who dont show up because of the violence
4733715 the problem of violence can be solved by instating a general overreach program not by implementing a limited one
4733716 leaving is not an option last year i asked internal security minister avi dichter to include jaffa in the city without violence project and he said that tel aviv jaffa does not meet the programs criteria
4733717 i am shocked and appalled this is outright racism to decide to deny arabs entry because theyre bad we cant accept people thinking that any official involved in making this decision should resign
4733718 the police should look into those matters and set things right but it cant affect the pool
4733719 hey baby calm down we just wanna have a little fun

4733724 el acuerdo por parte del juzgado y el hecho de que el ministerio p blico no haya solicitado ninguna medida concreta en la situaci n personal del se or g lvez implica que en su actuaci n en relaci n a los hechos que se est n estudiando y de los que tenemos un conocimiento escaso es pr cticamente ninguna

4733727 el marcador dice que yo puse la mano en el muro primero
4733728 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude
4733729 yo sab a que no estaba tan detr s de cavic como en la eliminatoria cuando cort la ltima brazada pens que me costar a la carrera pero fue justamente lo contrario si yo me hubiera deslizado no habr a ido tan lejos hice dos r pidas brazadas cortas para intentar llegar y tocar el muro al final tome la decisi n correcta
4733730 vi la carrera despu s en la pantalla gigante y la vi a c mara lenta imagen a imagen en la c mara de masaje en el ordenador
4733731 esto demuestra que no importa lo que pongas en tu imaginaci n que cualquier cosa puede pasar sue a tanto como puedas so ar y cualquier cosa ser posible
4733732 algunas personas dec an que esto ser a imposible y no pasar a esto muestra que cualquier cosa puede suceder antes de que yo fuera a entrenar con bob bowman entrenador del equipo de los estados unidos es el nico que realmente me ayud a querer so ar acerca de cualquier cosa
4733733 yo quer a ser un atleta profesional y s quer a ganar medallas ol mpicas pero l es el nico que me dijo que so ara que so ara tanto como pudiera finalmente ha ocurrido el duro trabajo que bob y yo hemos realizado juntos nos ha dado sus frutos

4733735 ya lo he dicho antes y lo seguir diciendo mi meta principal es cambiar el deporte de la nataci n por los chicos que vienen a este deporte y por el deporte en am rica
4733736 as que dijo mi meta se est empezando a cumplir pero me queda un largo camino todav a
4733737 creo que bob y yo podemos pensar en m s objetivos en los pr ximos cuatro a os
4733738 si bob y yo hici ramos esto por dinero estar amos en otro deporte
4733739 estoy en una especie de mundo de los sue os algunas veces me tengo que pinchar a m mismo para estar seguro de que es real estoy feliz de estar en el mundo real
4733740 inmediatamente despu s de la carrera tuvimos una protesta de la delegaci n de serbia cuestionando la llegada y afirmando que su nadador hab a sido m s r pido
4733741 seg n nuestras reglas revisamos imagen a imagen el v deo de omega y estaba muy claro que el nadador serbio tocaba segundo despu s de phelps es evidente que uno est braceando y el otro est volando de acuerdo con nuestras reglas usamos el sistema autom tico de cronometrar y el sistema en este caso estaba en perfectas condiciones en perfecto orden y no hay duda
4733742 despu s de ver el v deo nos reunimos con los serbios para darles una explicaci n y ofrecerles a ellos el v deo porque no hab an tenido la oportunidad debido a que antes las reglas no se lo permiten
4733743 las im genes son las que se ven en la c mara de cronometro de omega
4733744 michael phelps es el m s grande y hubiera sido el primero de cualquier forma la cuesti n era compartir o no compartir el primer puesto los jueces fueron muy claros no hay duda el primero que lleg fue michael phelps
4733745 el sistema de cronometraje siempre es probado antes de la competici n antes de usarlo siempre lo probamos si no est s de acuerdo con los rbitros puedes apelar al jurado pero ellos los serbios la aceptaron no es el ojo del hombre el que decide qui n gana sino el sistema de cronometraje
4733746 el primer paso es hacer una protesta a los rbitros en 30 minutos y el arbitro contesta el siguiente es apelar que es el ultimo y ellos decidieron no apelar y aceptar la decisi n de los rbitros
4733747 el sistema de crono funciona en dos diferentes maneras uno por el cable y otro por bater a y son independientes
4733748 i was not a christian for many many years of my life and when i decided to go back to the church i just experienced that there are a lot of people that have that need for a religion and im hoping i can help people
4733749 everybody who came was so struck by what a powerful spiritual experience it was
4733750 he seems to be a great listener and very empathetic and interested in people
4733751 so i think he brings that kind of nurturing which is so important for people that maybe have lost their spouse or their kids are not here in town its almost like church provides a family for people and he just sort of seems to meet people where they are and support them that way
4733752 we got married on may 24 and seven days later on june 1 we moved to berkeley calif for seminary
4733753 it was pretty wild you cant change your life any more than what we did in seven days
4733754 this ordination was as much about my wifes work and triumph as it was about my own studies and work to get to this point
4733755 and of course its all a celebration of what god has done with us
4733756 i was given a snow shovel by one of the congregations
4733757 its this calling that god has called some people to know we have to know the bible back and forth and we have to know human relationships back and forth
4733758 the church wants to grow and i think god wants it to grow too
4733759 you cant focus on numbers you have to focus on ministry if you focus on that take care of the people and the people in the community it will draw people to us
4733760 trying to set aside enough time for both family and work takes a lot of practice
4733761 motherhood the elephant in the laboratory women scientists speak out
4733762 critical to being able to juggle a scientific career and a young family was having the perfect collaborator a husband who shared all aspects with me from scientific discovery to baby trips to the doctor
4733763 it was a male dominated environment when i first arrived there
4733764 i remember clearly how all astronomers were spoken of as he and never she and there were no family leave policies or tenure clock stop policies at the time to support young scientists and engineers as they started families
4733765 stefi is a very compassionate person ready to listen to each and everyone of us and accommodate our needs
4733766 she has an unending reservoir of energy and was able to stamp her particular leadership style pretty soon after she joined the center
4733767 im a single mom and like stefi i understand the extra effort that is required to carry on with our academic duties while helping our kids to grow up and be responsible citizens
4733768 im not sure this is something that our male colleagues understand fully

4733782 how could you not be a baseball fan its such a great game
4733783 all i do during baseball season is watch games i was so pumped the other night when greg maddux stole a base my team is the braves but they dont stand much of a chance
4733784 we dont really have any baseball fans except for my stage manager who is a cubs fan and my road manager who is a red sox fan
4733785 unfortunately for the guys in my band they have to sit and watch the games
4733786 i have to be drawn to the lyrics or im completely uninterested
4733787 im a storyteller im not concerned about showing off vocally or whatever you want to make a song shimmer but if im really loving a song even if it takes 30 takes in the recording studio to get that vocal right i never tire of it my vocal range is very limited but hopefully what i have is more of an emotional range and the emotional range can be limitless if you have the right song
4733788 it was such a thrill to meet her back in the mid 1980s and then to actually sing with her later on i love not only her distinctive voice her songwriting and the great songs she picks to sing by other artists but she also just always has the greatest bands in the world her hot band was such a school for really wonderful up and coming musicians from ricky skaggs to rodney crowell
4733789 they were an astonishing group to play with and taught me so much about harmony singing
4733790 weve had an amicable relationship professionally and as parents of our daughter for many years
4733791 i guess i always thought that at some point wed do another record together and this seemed like the right time
4733792 i made a conscious effort to do that in 1990 by abandoning my group the hot band
4733793 i guess i needed even more change after a few years and thats when i made the edgy intensely atmospheric 1995 album wrecking ball which really took me to another planet i wasnt really singing any differently but because of the free flowing rhythms and completely different sound u2 producer daniel lanois brought to the mix it was just inspiring
4733794 i always feel that the grass has to be your starting point
4733795 i never go below medium height even in the spring when its growing fast
4733796 one thing people do is they try to do too much and become overwhelmed
4733797 i just like to tinker and try to make things look nice
4733798 it was just a very nice way to work with the property
4733799 i do like to see some color when i pull in the driveway

4733818 low dividend growth or cut a decline in revenue and earnings for more than two years and a disinterest in the stock

4733821 i think michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball
4733822 what he achieved no other human has or in my opinion will its hard enough surviving cancer but winning seven tour de france titles after that is amazing
4733823 id have to say its a tie between michael jordan and tiger woods
4733824 jordan has the ability to be a closer the person everyone on his team can count on when the team needs a shot at the buzzer id like to think the three other people i am swimming with can count on me in the same way
4733825 has the ability to drown out all distraction and focus in on the moment i feel like i am in a similar situation in swimming since swimming is an individual sport how you perform can impact only you
4733826 jackie joyner kersee is the perfect athlete because she dedicates every day of her life to perfecting herself
4733827 its not so she can be the greatest athlete for her own selfish reasons but so she can deliver hope to a younger generation
4733828 i dont think there is such a thing as the perfect athlete
4733829 to be the perfect athlete i think one would need to be great at any sport they tried tiger woods is an incredible golfer he is physically and mentally tough and near perfect at what he does but would he have the ability to do gymnastics i dont think so

4733833 many times its possible to consolidate your shopping to one destination
4733834 this years back to school shopper is a bargain hunter at the core
4733835 though parents want to make sure kids are fully prepared for school they will be comparing prices online and in stores before making any big purchases
4733836 they should take stock of what they already have in terms of clothing and supplies and see what they can repurpose
4733837 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4733838 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4733839 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4733840 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4733841 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4733842 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4733843 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4734085 newspapers are less than honorable if they deal in rumor and innuendo
4734086 the media self psychoanalysis continues about why the mainstream media missed the story of john edwards affair but theres a reason the transition from tabloid cover to mainstream media does not happen with the same hyper warp speed that occurs with internet blogs and increasingly with cable television its called verification
4734087 the practice of verification distinguishes the mainstream media from other news sources published information is tied to documents or reliable human sources that usually can be independently scrutinized by others
4734088 for the most part rumor and innuendo are kept out of the news pages and thats a good thing serving as a protection for the reputations of innocent people and the credibility of the press

4734097 i am loyal to our supporters and people at the club but more than anything i am loyal to the players
4734098 we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed
4734099 if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season
4734100 that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down
4734101 at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it was possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face
4734102 it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic
4734103 no one has worked harder to get players in but it just hasnt happened yet there are all sorts of reasons and some of it must remain private
4734104 but there arent many clubs looking to sell players at the moment and certainly some people who have been brokering deals for us have let us down quite badly
4734105 i still hope to resolve everything with the club and sign a new contract

4734252 a year ago i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 23 goals and i replied that i was looking for improvement
4734253 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season forty two goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent of the boy and his goal scoring ability but you have to say its a big target for him
4734254 where you will see the improvement is in his authority and decision making which comes with experience whichgives you a lot of things timing especially
4734255 he has been doing excellent he is well ahead of schedule

4734292 we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed
4734293 if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season
4734294 that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down
4734295 at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it was possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face
4734296 it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic
4734297 no one has worked harder to get players in but it just hasnt happened yet there are all sorts of reasons and some of it must remain private
4734298 but there arent many clubs looking to sell players at the moment and certainly some people who have been brokering deals for us have let us down quite badly

4734326 i was not a christian for many many years of my life and when i decided to go back to the church i just experienced that there are a lot of people that have that need for a religion and im hoping i can help people
4734327 everybody who came was so struck by what a powerful spiritual experience it was
4734328 he seems to be a great listener and very empathetic and interested in people
4734329 so i think he brings that kind of nurturing which is so important for people that maybe have lost their spouse or their kids are not here in town its almost like church provides a family for people and he just sort of seems to meet people where they are and support them that way
4734330 we got married on may 24 and seven days later on june 1 we moved to berkeley calif for seminary
4734331 it was pretty wild you cant change your life any more than what we did in seven days
4734332 this ordination was as much about my wifes work and triumph as it was about my own studies and work to get to this point
4734333 and of course its all a celebration of what god has done with us
4734334 i was given a snow shovel by one of the congregations
4734335 its this calling that god has called some people to know we have to know the bible back and forth and we have to know human relationships back and forth
4734336 the church wants to grow and i think god wants it to grow too
4734337 you cant focus on numbers you have to focus on ministry if you focus on that take care of the people and the people in the community it will draw people to us

4734339 john madden left the broadcast booth some time ago and despite an increased presence in 09 his headset remains dormant at least play by play has been included this time around though tom hammonds deadpan delivery isnt much of an improvement over the radio announcer from last year cris collinsworth handles the color commentary and does a fine job but where he really excels is in the backtrack feature which points out mistakes you made with a startling accuracy the madden series is a seesaw every year as it inevitably adds features that are hit or miss while failing to address long standing issues madden nfl 09 is no different theres a whole lot of game here but that was true last year and for every gameplay improvement theres something annoying to dampen the enthusiasm its still an excellent football game but the casual player is going to like it a lot more than the grizzled vet
4734340 as to the t mobile rumor i really cant comment but android has been due for sometime now
4734341 q4 delivery of an android product would make sense and htc does seem to be the most likely device manufacturer to deliver a first android device
4734342 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4734343 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4734344 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening
4734345 with android you dont have one device that you can use as a frame of reference
4734346 a large number of developers dont know what it an android phone is going to look like or how popular its going to be i dont see or hear a large number of developers that are developing for android yet
4734347 chorea is a major cause of disability and death in patients with huntingtons disease chorea is not just a mere inconvenience it can prevent huntingtons disease patients from walking talking working watching television and almost every aspect of ones life we are ecstatic that through the approval of xenazine patients and families will have the option to take the only drug developed specifically for treating the movements of huntingtons disease
4734348 while we are still hopeful we can some day find a cure the approval of xenazine is a breakthrough for the huntingtons disease community
4734349 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4734350 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4734351 weve known for more than 10 years which gene is at fault but we havent known some of the specifics of the process
4734352 now that we know that the fly gene works pretty much the way that the human one does we can look for the key substrate in flies and eventually test likely candidates in mice and see if theyre really associated with the disease
4734353 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4734354 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4734355 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4734356 an important reason to study metacognitive monitoring processes is because monitoring is supposed to play a central role in directing how people study
4734357 our research affects issues of cognitive intellectual development and can be used to develop training programs particularly for young children to ensure adequate metacognitive processing in educational contexts

4734364 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4734365 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies
4734366 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4734367 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4734368 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4734369 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4734370 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4734371 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4734372 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4734373 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4734374 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4734375 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4734376 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4734377 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4734378 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4734379 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4734380 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4734381 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4734382 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4734383 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4734384 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4734385 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease
4734386 ocular sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis in brazil compared with europe
4734387 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to ones self and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4734388 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired
4734389 is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behavior which would place new selection pressures on populations and favor adaptive divergence
4734390 brain size and the diversification of body size in birds
4734391 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4734392 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4734393 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4734394 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4734395 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families
4734396 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4734397 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4734398 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4734399 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4734400 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4734401 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4734402 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4734403 early case identification and treatment with oseltamivir is key to addressing the high case fatality rate in indonesian cases there is a clear need to identify definite causes for high case fatality while additional research is done we propose the following strategies to provide early diagnosis and prompt treatment to improve quality of case management poultry surveillance is being stepped up and active human case finding by local health centres and village officials is being instituted in areas of poultry deaths
4734404 consideration needs to be given now not in the teeth of a pandemic and not deflected by either proprietary defensiveness or opportunistic profiteering to gauging the comprehensiveness of national surveillance for human h5n1 cases and to ensuring the analysability of a minimum dataset on the exposures and clinical course of every confirmed case of human h5n1 the world also needs to find a more equitable way to ensure that all share in the benefits of such important research indonesia could give the lead here
4734405 flexus tm is the culmination of utilizing surgeon input and engineering simplicity to create innovative technologies to treat spinal stenosis the flexus tm ide reflects globus position as the worldwide leader in the development of posterior motion preservation devices we are excited to begin the clinical trial to develop strong supportive data for the product
4734406 the combination of a unilateral approach and a unitary implant makes flexus tm not only a more efficient procedure but also one that is less traumatic to the patient
4734407 i am pleased with the peek design as it will enable better radiographic follow up and allow me to monitor both the decompression and the adjacent anatomy
4734408 the surgical technique and approach was very straightforward the simplicity of the flexus tm design in distracting the stenotic segment may be beneficial in treating this painful condition we are excited to participate in this ide

4734451 they found she had a hardening around her belly button
4734452 basically the doctors gave it a fancy name which can be called flesh eating disease
4734453 i can confirm that there were two babies transferred up from the lethbridge regional hospital but flesh eating disease is a specific diagnosis and the organism was not isolated in either baby
4734454 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language
4734455 our involvement from the ministry is to see what is going on and theres been nothing to suggest a breach of proper infection control measures we havent been able to find any reason why these babies developed the infection
4734456 why is it two babies born on the same day in the same hospital have the same problem
4734457 the fires started one after another over a few block area
4734458 the whole backyard was just going orangey red and i could see the house beside me just engulfed in flames
4734459 you wonder if people really understand the repercussions of how this affects someones life
4734460 hes got a wife and two kids and his house is just torched
4734461 its life changing just the stupidity of these people to do this

4734478 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4734479 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were s but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4734480 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4734481 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4734482 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4734483 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4734484 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4734485 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4734486 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4734487 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4734488 i just came to run and do what i can do
4734489 i cant be too mad because thats all i had today so im just happy that i was in contention until the last little bit when they started pulling away all in all it was a good experience
4734490 it was just that i gave them too much in the beginning in the sense that between the 800 and 1 200 meter mark they had a little gap with this caliber of guys you cant really make up that gap in the last 300 meters thats what i got myself into but im still happy
4734491 i didnt get it done when i needed to i guess

4734499 i cannot give you an answer because there isnt one
4734500 we have been trying to add to the squad but nothing has changed i have nothing else to say
4734501 you might be surprised at what is going to happen over the next two days
4734502 you would think with young players like anderson ronaldo rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that
4734503 there is no doubt this team will win championships long after i have left there is a good foundation here now
4734504 i am friends with carlos and we will talk before the game
4734505 hes very good and our defenders will have to pay a lot of attention because he can score a goal at any moment
4734506 there are many good players in the united team but carlos is playing very well and had a great season last time
4734507 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward
4734508 he played well in the friendly matches but he is quiet if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything
4734509 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for him
4734510 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4734511 there is no money left to spend the owner has backed me and i cant fault him there are still great players here but we still are short of cover

4734517 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window

4734528 i am loyal to our supporters and people at the club but more than anything i am loyal to the players
4734529 we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed
4734530 if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season
4734531 that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down
4734532 at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it was possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face
4734533 it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic
4734534 no one has worked harder to get players in but it just hasnt happened yet there are all sorts of reasons and some of it must remain private
4734535 but there arent many clubs looking to sell players at the moment and certainly some people who have been brokering deals for us have let us down quite badly
4734536 i still hope to resolve everything with the club and sign a new contract
4734537 david moyes is probably the best manager this club has ever had yet howard was the one who won the trophies
4734538 they said they werent willing to give me an extended contract so that gives me no option but to get my head down thats not a problem
4734539 lets get one thing straight i want to sign for fulham hopefully in time they will extend my contract

4734543 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
4734544 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night

4734552 i cannot give you an answer because there isnt one
4734553 we have been trying to add to the squad but nothing has changed i have nothing else to say
4734554 you might be surprised at what is going to happen over the next two days
4734555 you would think with young players like anderson ronaldo rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that
4734556 there is no doubt this team will win championships long after i have left there is a good foundation here now
4734557 i am friends with carlos and we will talk before the game
4734558 hes very good and our defenders will have to pay a lot of attention because he can score a goal at any moment
4734559 there are many good players in the united team but carlos is playing very well and had a great season last time

4734561 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward
4734562 he played well in the friendly matches but he is quiet if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything
4734563 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for him
4734564 we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4734565 there is no money left to spend the owner has backed me and i cant fault him there are still great players here but we still are short of cover
4734566 its annoying for sailing as a sport it does not look good when you cant race because there is no wind
4734567 its not the sports fault its not the sailors fault its the fact that we have been put in this venue where we do not get any wind
4734568 with this venue we always knew it was going to be a bit like this i think you have to accept it and try not to let it wind you up to much
4734569 its only going to make the challenge harder for you

4734573 beh a dire il vero il tuo cuore molto meno bello del mio
4734574 confronta il tuo cuore col mio il mio perfetto mentre il tuo un rattoppo di ferite e lacrime
4734575 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai a cambio col mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio amore ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ne ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi e cos ho qualche rattoppo a cui sono affezionato per ciascuno mi ricorda lamore che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini amare rischioso certo ma per quanto dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che provo anche per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo spazio che ho riservato per loro comprendi adesso che cosa sia la vera bellezza
4734576 as to the t mobile rumor i really cant comment but android has been due for sometime now
4734577 q4 delivery of an android product would make sense and htc does seem to be the most likely device manufacturer to deliver a first android device
4734578 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4734579 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4734580 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening
4734581 with android you dont have one device that you can use as a frame of reference
4734582 a large number of developers dont know what it an android phone is going to look like or how popular its going to be i dont see or hear a large number of developers that are developing for android yet

4734593 delegation of episcopal priests from fort worth paid a visit to catholic bishop kevin vann earlier this summer asking for guidance on how their highly conservative diocese might come into
4734594 in those days there was no king in israel every man did what was right in his own eyes
4734595 what was not possible twenty years ago may be possible today
4734596 it feels really great i owe everything to my husband also coach and my family who have supported and believed in me do i have any plans no
4734597 hang in there just hang in there go and go harder couldnt let up and the whole field didnt let up either such a hard race tried to play it differently than the semifinal because i knew there was a lot of early speed i found i could sustain it and just up it a little bit just tried to stay strong stay fresh at 500m i pushed a bit harder 30 power strokes at the end which turned into 40 45 just go and it worked this was better than my best race
4734598 i saw that the czech girl went out fast with bulgaria following her i was trying to keep my strength for the whole race and to have enough energy for the final sprint i did what i could rumyana neykova was losing all season and far behind and if she could win here then she is stronger i never thought that michelle guerette would come second
4734599 it was a hard race and for a while i thought i had lost it but today i did not want to lose i did this for my team and my family after this im going to go home and get married
4734600 it wasnt expected that wed get a medal because the olympics is such a huge event were very honoured to take silver the romanians are a very experienced crew and theyve already been to two olympics
4734601 that was a bad race i am not satisfied with the result

4734620 i was impressed with the way they scrummed against the springboks
4734621 i thought she was going to attack me but anyway part of the job so just got to be polite
4734622 theres someone whos probably taken some big risks in life and is comfortable with uncertainty
4734623 man that dude is grossly overpaid he doesnt even do anything more than i do at work i work way harder than that guy why does he get to make so much money
4734624 person1 i want to make money as a blogger like those 25k m bloggers out there whats the first step
4734625 our board feels rather strongly about the open door policy
4734626 but we also recognize that the community colleges are supported by the taxpayers so we have to listen to both sides
4734627 we have people who say to us what part of illegal do you not understand
4734628 we should be serving those young people who have grown up in our community who have graduated from our high schools and are likely to remain in our communities
4734629 while i cannot absolutely say that there are not more i think its very unlikely that there are many more than that
4734630 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4734631 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4734632 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardizing russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
4734633 held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4734634 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world
4734635 there will be a time and a place to deal with the consequences and the repercussions of russias actions
4734636 its clear the policies we have pursued regarding missile defense and installations in europe regarding further expansion of nato have created difficulties with russia
4734637 i know that in this community people want to be connected and want to be involved
4734638 our downfall is that we havent done a good job in communicating for a long time we took the low hanging fruit and went to the same people were trying to broaden that base
4734639 i think its more important for our community to get this right
4734640 we have this baby boom generation thats getting ready otcbb gtry to retire people are living longer they want to be engaged they want to remain involved in things that are important
4734641 if an increasing number of families on the stable side are being affected by the economy volunteering may not be one of the priorities they set for their families right then and there
4734642 financially you might not be able to donate money but you can make a difference if you volunteer your time
4734643 when you weigh out the benefits its no problem paying for the gas
4734644 we have a culture in north carolina of helping each other of neighbors helping neighbors going through tough times
4734645 they dont consider themselves a volunteer they take food over to a neighbor they do something in church its a different sort of mind set so when they say only 33 percent are volunteering i would say no way jose they dont count the informal volunteering of giving back to your fellow man
4734646 im hoping that we are going to hold our own and maybe even see a small increase
4734647 im concerned energy concerns will have an impact on the number of people who volunteer gas prices keep going up
4734648 specific sites lowes may be considering for new stores unless we have closed on all real estate matters
4734649 its been hard because ive been sick ive had heart surgery and everything else
4734650 i think its pretty sad when people are on fixed income and all of a sudden their homes are destroyed
4734651 i dont like having to pay lot rent and having to get out
4734652 i dont think thats right youve got older people whove been here for so long theyve got to have money to put down for their deposit
4734653 they give us 60 days from the date of the notice if a person cant get out in 60 days its something wrong with their banking account
4734654 all these older people who live here i dont know what theyre going to do
4734655 if you could give them notices at income tax time people would have money to move but no this is down right cruel
4734656 we are trying to cross train them to existing staff to work on bank failures so we dont need a huge staff waiting around for the next bank failure
4734657 in the 1980s one third of the s amp ls were insolvent
4734658 even if you listen to the extreme reports today it does not sound as if it will be anything like that
4734659 i came in about three weeks before the bank was closed
4734660 if anybody asked why they were in town they were told to say that they were with the toy shop on business
4734661 you dont want to start a run on the bank
4734662 i was the asset manager and the biggest assets were in utah
4734663 they also had offices in jackson hole wyo and idaho falls idaho so we consolidated them
4734664 between friday night and sunday morning we separated the bad loans that would ultimately be sold off from the assets and deposits that would go to pulaski bank and trust company
4734665 we are contemplating turning one project down where the borrowers need another 7 million to 8 million
4734666 we are about halfway through but the builders net worth is not as strong as we would like
4734667 i get gratification at a job well done and knowing that people did not lose their money
4734668 any money that retirees take out of their portfolios or that they lose in market declines in the first five years of retirement has a higher cost because its money that wont be invested to earn returns in succeeding years when the markets recover
4734669 and the less they have invested after a bear market the less potential they have to benefit from the compounding of any earnings in subsequent years
4734670 psychologically people find it hard to retire when the market is down 20 percent
4734671 thats a self imposed discipline that retirees would be wise to adhere to
4734672 you want to figure out what is the right portfolio mix for you and to also understand or have a realistic sense of how bumpy the risk is likely to be
4734673 its not sufficient to say that im well diversified because im 60 30 10 in stocks bonds and cash
4734674 large cap and small cap growth and value domestic and international
4734675 rebalancing forces us to do what is emotionally uncomfortable but financially productive
4734676 the natural thing to do is to add to areas that are doing really well
4734677 youve gotta know when to hold em know when to fold em
4734678 the dip a little book that teaches you when to quit and when to stick
4734679 they just quit the right stuff at the right time
4734680 how do you draw the line between whats attainable and whats not
4734681 this relentless pursuit of goals has a cost to it
4734682 if you are a pursuing a goal that is constantly frustrating you will be less successful in goal attainment in other areas of life
4734683 one of the most frustrating goals for people is weight loss or weight loss maintenance
4734684 stepping back temporarily and saying im going to try to live a healthy life and not try so hard to lose weight
4734685 there is a huge amount of social and psychological forces keeping people from quitting
4734686 they didnt want to be a sucker paying 12 for nothing
4734687 rather than thinking about winning theyre playing not to lose
4734688 it is as important to teach someone how to quit as staying committed
4734689 lots of times people just stop showing up and thats wrong
4734690 i tried to work it out and this not a good match for me do it in a responsible manner
4734691 youre going against the grain and its hard to be the lone dissenter
4734692 for europeans its more understandable to have to quit a goal because its healthier because its wreaking havoc on other parts of your life
4734693 aligning itself firmly with washington georgia sent troops to afghanistan and iraq bush visited georgia in a show of solidarity and promised that the united states would stand with the former soviet republic
4734694 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside

4734712 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions
4734713 why does this remarkable species devise a vastly laborious and time consuming system for channeling its piss and shite into its water supply and then expend equally vast amounts of time and effort on partly removing its piss and shite from its water supply
4734714 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

4734758 apabila membenarkan anwar bertanding dalam pilihanraya ia merupakan satu kaedah yang beliau tidak bersalah
4734759 dalam islam sesiapapun bebas bersumpah untuk membuktikan dirinya benar tetapi bukanlah dengan memegang kitab suci al quran kerana ia adalah perbuatan orang kristian yang memegang kitab mereka ketika bersumpah

4734815 i remember looking down and seeing 106 fever 10 days unresponsive after one of the immunizations
4734816 i think that parents need to really think about medical advice thats one size fits all whether its for a vaccine or something else they need to look at their individual child
4734817 act as if the principle on which your action is based were to become by your will a universal law of nature
4734818 if not explicitly then at least implicitly commanded that the principle of the advancement of science bow to a higher principle protection of individual inviolability the rights of individuals to thoroughgoing self determination and autonomy must come first scientific advances may be impeded perhaps even become impossible at times but this is a price worth paying
4734819 envisioned a world in which free women and men after careful explanation could make their own good or bad decisions but not decisions unknowingly imposed on them by the authority of the state science or medicine
4734820 the nuremberg code explicitly rejects the moral argument that the creation of benefits for many justifies the sacrifice of the few every experiment no matter how important or valuable requires the express voluntary consent of the individual the right of individuals to control their bodies trumps the interest of others in obtaining knowledge or benefits from them
4734821 the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential this means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice without the intervention of any element of force fraud deceit duress overreaching or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision
4734822 conscience is a judgment of reason whereby the human person recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act that he is going to perform is in the process of performing or has already completed in all he says and does man is obliged to follow faithfully what he knows to be just and right it is by the judgment of his conscience that man perceives and recognizes the prescription of the divine law
4734823 a human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience if he were deliberately to act against it he would condemn himself
4734824 whenever war politics or ideology treat humans as objects we all lose our humanity
4734825 when you take an idea or a concept and turn it into an abstraction that opens the way to take human beings and turn in any war whether it be a war using humans armed with guns in an attempt to defeat other humans or a war using humans injected with vaccines in an attempt to eliminate microorganisms it is easy for those in charge to view the instruments of that war human beings as objects and a means to an end
4734826 when the number of deaths caused by a disease in a community outweigh the number of births
4734827 let us not forget that progress is an optional goal not an unconditional commitment and that its tempo in particular compulsive as it may be has nothing sacred about it let us also remember that a slower progress in the conquest of disease would not threaten society grievous as it is to those who have to deplore that their particular disease be not yet con quered but that society would indeed by threatened by the erosion of those moral values whose loss possibly caused by too ruthless a pursuit of scientific progress would make its most dazzling triumphs not worth having
4734828 our conduct whatever our ethic may be will only serve social purposes in so far as self interest and the interests of society are in harmony
4734829 it is the business of wise institutions to create such harmony as far as possible
4734830 the committee was unable to address the concern that repeated exposure of a susceptible child to multiple immunizations over the developmental period may also produce atypical or non specific immune or nervous system injury that could lead to severe disability or death fisher 2001 there are no epidemiological studies that address this thus the committee recognizes with some discomfort that this report addresses only part of the overall set of concerns of some of those most wary about the safety of childhood immunizations
4734831 felt powerlessness of ordinary people the resignation before the enormity of events
4734832 the subjective apathy is encouraged by the objective american situation the actual structural separation of people from power from relevant knowledge from pinnacles of decision making the very isolation of the individual from power and community and the ability to aspire means the rise of democracy without publics
4734833 babies are born with a very immature cellular immune system
4734834 childhood viral infectious diseases like measles mumps and chickenpox initially stimulate the cellular part of the immune system which leads to the production of the signs of inflammation fever redness swelling and mucus this cellular immune response stimulates the humoral part of the immune system to produce anti inflammatory chemicals and antibodies that assist in recovery from these illnesses this natural process helps the cellular and humoral immune systems mature a healthy mature immune system for children requires an equal balance of cellular and humoral immune system responses
4734835 vaccination does not mimic the natural infection process although vaccines stimulate production of antibodies in an attempt to artificially induce immunity to disease chronic inflammation can be a by product of vaccination by disrupting the balance of cellular and humoral immune system responses especially in those children genetically predisposed to inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disorders
4734836 physically health is about balancing acute inflammatory responses to infection which stimulate one arm of the immune system and chronic inflammatory responses to infection which stimulate the other arm of the immune system overuse of vaccines to suppress all acute externalizing inflammations early in life can set up the immune system to respond to future stresses and infections by developing chronic internalizing disease later in life

4734930 t he difference between an abstract question and a controversy contemplated by the declaratory judgment act is necessarily one of degree and it would be difficult if it would be possible to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy
4734931 the analysis must be calibrated to the particular facts of each case

4734973 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4734974 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4734975 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4734976 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4734977 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4734978 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4734979 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4734994 but i think youve got to balance it against all of the other issues that the consumer faces
4734995 macro economic conditions remained weak and the selling environment particularly as we moved into the back to school selling period was tough
4734996 its the first time ive heard parents tell their children this is all we can afford this year
4734997 maybe numbers are being cut low enough that expectations can be met or even beat

4735072 give us your swift your strong your huddled athletes longing to be olympians
4735073 so to have such an off routine was really disappointing to me thats one of the routines that gets my score up there
4735074 it was my first event and it is my best event so i should have been confident on it and doing really well i just didnt perform my routine to the best of my ability its as simple as that
4735075 i knew it was my last routine with my coach and i was really pleased at how it went the last event was excellent a good way to finish off
4735076 im just going to take those with me and focus on the positive things because its still the olympics and its pretty much a once in a lifetime opportunity for me its still amazing to be here
4735077 if the opportunity should arrive and im needed or if im still in good shape its definitely a possibility
4735078 este foarte greu ca fc arge s ia m car un punct n ghencea
4735079 evident ca meciul cu fc arges trebuie tratat cu toata serizoitatea ei isi pun mari sperante si in general echipele mici care vin in ghencea lupta mult cu steaua dar trebuie sa se gandeasca si ei ca steaua este o echipa de liga campionilor si este foarte greu sa ia macar un punct

4735083 a hundredth of a second is the most difficult loss you can have especially at the olympics
4735084 but its a complete miracle to me that im here im enjoying this moment from my heart
4735085 beforehand bob said it would be good for me if i lost
4735086 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4735087 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4735088 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the record

4735148 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4735149 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4735150 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4735151 a problem occurred when trying to transfer the file tsdata res sound voice5 package
4735152 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air

4735157 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4735158 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4735159 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4735169 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4735170 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4735171 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4735172 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4735173 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4735174 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4735175 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4735176 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4735177 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4735178 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4735179 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4735180 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4735181 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4735182 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4735183 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4735184 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4735185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4735186 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4735187 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4735188 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4735189 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4735190 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4735191 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4735192 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4735193 who are open to doing something on the production side
4735194 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4735195 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4735196 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4735197 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4735198 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4735199 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4735200 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4735201 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4735202 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4735203 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4735204 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4735205 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4735206 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4735207 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4735208 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4735209 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4735210 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4735211 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4735212 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4735213 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4735214 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4735215 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4735216 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4735217 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4735218 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4735219 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4735220 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4735221 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4735222 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4735223 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4735224 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4735225 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4735226 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4735227 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4735228 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4735229 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4735230 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4735231 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4735232 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4735233 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4735234 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4735235 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4735236 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4735237 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4735238 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4735239 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4735240 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4735241 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4735242 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4735243 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4735244 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4735245 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4735246 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4735247 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4735248 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4735249 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4735250 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4735251 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4735252 watch your cars mileage rise to unprecedented heights and your gasoline expenses go
4735253 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4735254 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4735255 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4735256 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4735257 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4735258 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4735259 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4735260 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4735261 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4735262 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4735263 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4735264 as promised when symphony was launched we will be coming out with updates every two months
4735265 but this is just the start of the open platform we have envisioned
4735266 theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4735267 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4735268 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4735269 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4735270 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4735271 they probably will be the third team in our group
4735272 one of the first times i saw her when she was awake in the icu she was asking me why i wasnt coaching the team
4735273 she was extremely encouraging she was adamant that i stay she assured me shes going to be good weve had a week here to grieve together and ive been trying to do my best to help her through this very difficult process
4735274 but shes a strong woman and shes in a good place right now to be with her family and to get on with the next phase of this thing
4735275 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4735276 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4735277 theres nothing we can do about it the fact is that so many people want to help us pick up the pieces is certainly the positive thing in this whole thing
4735278 i think that theres some comfort or something in just getting back into the normal rhythm of how i deal with my players when im here im here and im giving it everything ive got
4735279 when im not with the team i have to go and kind of recharge my batteries and get ready for the next round i hope that over the next couple of days ill be able to do that im confident that ill be able to do that otherwise i wouldnt be here
4735280 i think we wanted to play as hard as we could for him
4735281 but he didnt want to make it about him he wanted it to be about the team
4735282 when i win the medal it will be for akhil
4735283 i was not expecting for him to miss but i could feel the nervousness building up inside me so i wasnt hoping for it to last much longer
4735284 my personal motto is if youre perfect nobody can beat you
4735285 you want to fight the next day or two but im still happy im a mexican american representing his country at the heaviest weight weve ever done it
4735286 when i win the medal it will be for akhil
4735287 ive beaten him already so i know i can do it
4735288 i had said russia were the strongest nation here ahead of
4735289 we wanted an all green suit so that we werent visible we were very conscious of being visible in the water
4735290 the open water swim is very rough and people tend to converge on each other because there are no lanes there can be physical interaction and the perception is that at times it can be deliberate
4735291 between the slushies the ice vests and the colder water on the bikes our guys are pretty well prepared
4735292 i was trying to run as slow as i could and advance
4735293 it is very unfortunate what happened to them and i have heard the allegations about me but i dont know whats going on
4735294 i have been training secluded and have barely seen my team mates

4735318 it seems to me ive seen that look you have upon your face a thousand times before
4735319 maybe the one of hurt pride of having to sit alone on rain swept mornings drinking to forget
4735320 well i never this conversation seems to be going round in circles do i look the lonely sort do i look as if i have no friends
4735321 sort of but i wouldnt go as far as saying in the sense of academic pursuits universities for me have always held a kind of well
4735322 a threshold of boredom that i find easy to cross
4735323 oh i see youre more the self educated class the kind that searches the rivers of life that flow through our world and take from it what you wish
4735324 very well spoken i could not have put it better myself here let me buy you another
4735325 they say there is no end in sight to this weather i suppose in biblical times people would be building an ark by now it seems that spring is slumbering still under the overcoat of winter
4735326 yes its very strange indeed very strange ive seen nothing like this in my life before by the way i could not help thinking that when you said earlier that you were very old that you look well on it what ever age you are
4735327 thank you kind sir it is difficult knowing what to do with eternity
4735328 but then again i watch the grass growing and it watches me shrinking and if i lived so long i would probably die of terminal boredom anyway living in a place like this i have difficulty fitting in as it is let alone after so much time
4735329 many miles i never seem to stop yes i was born many years ago in the southern states of america down louisiana way in the swampy marshlands
4735330 i have not been back there for a long long time
4735331 and did you know there are many people on this planet who believe more in past lives than this one
4735332 yes it is good to talk of life in such a manner one is not enough you need many to give understanding and even then thousands more are not sufficient
4735333 you must know the story of peter pan the boy who would not grow up or could not grow up im not sure which and of course there was wendy and that other pesky child and of course captain hook and if you stretch your memory a little further there was a very large crocodile who when attempting to eat hook on one occasion accidentally swallowed a ticking clock that fell into his open jaws
4735334 well if you put your ear a little closer to my chest tell me what it is you can hear
4735335 your not saying in all seriousness that youre the crocodile are you are you what i thought earlier when i noticed your black nail varnish and black mascara one of those
4735336 well i never it does sound like what you said have you had it examined surely it cannot be right i mean its not natural to have such a thing
4735337 has it ever gone off in public the alarm i mean
4735338 but i will have to be going now im meeting a pal of mine down at the mucky duck down by the river and i cannot be late it has been very nice meeting you you have cheered me up no end you have rescued me from the doldrums
4735339 look im pushing off down to muggersby about a mile down stream if im not mistaken there are one or two tasty morsels i have to meet do you mind if i walk with you down as far as the river
4735340 if this carries on much longer it will fill the pub well goodbye dear friend
4735341 if i dont see you again take all the care in the world and get that ticking noise sorted out

4735353 were going to have to see but i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games the proof will be in the pudding but hopefully i will be fine
4735354 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully touch wood i will be able to do that
4735355 its been tough the toughest part of my career so far definitely
4735356 obviously there are rumours and everything there were times that it did get on top of me you have your friends and family and you need those people around you to keep you going
4735357 the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt fit at the time
4735358 then he doesnt really know the history of everything that comes with it i admit it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4735359 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4735360 he had a serious injury which means we have to treat him differently to the rest of the squad and take it game by game to see how his knee responds
4735361 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4735362 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us
4735363 weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it
4735364 there are 38 games and every one is tough you have to be willing to grind out results when youre not playing so well and get results away from home
4735365 weve not been doing that and well have to do that if we want to break in the top four
4735366 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico

4735375 to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4735376 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4735377 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4735378 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4735379 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4735380 they probably will be the third team in our group
4735381 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday

4735391 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4735392 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4735393 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4735394 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4735395 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4735396 the failure to make a couple defensive plays gave them extra outs and then the momentum of our inabilility to get outs became insurmountable
4735397 the whole game changed and changed dramatically in their favor after we the mistakes
4735398 we did some good hitting tonight we stuck with it and hustled thoughout the ball game
4735399 i am sure every historian archaeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4735400 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4735401 our objective is to find and protect the wrecks because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4735402 once we have covered a certain area it will be marked finished nobody has to go there it is done
4735403 we never had real relationships we were so dependent and leaned so heavily on others that they rebelled and pulled away then we grew resentful
4735404 well where were sitting right now used to be underwater
4735405 but youre probably talking about the pool garden they drain it mid september and use it as tennis courts

4735408 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world

4735410 the united states will soon leave the region then regional countries should fill the security vacuum there is no need for interference of other countries
4735411 such projects in natural gas and oil require investment and they take time
4735412 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4735413 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4735414 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4735415 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4735416 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4735417 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4735418 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4735419 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4735420 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4735421 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4735422 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4735423 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4735424 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4735425 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4735426 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood
4735427 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4735428 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4735429 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4735430 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union

4735433 dakwaan urutan ini mampu meningkatkan tenaga batin dan ketahanan alat kelamin ketika melakukan hubungan seks tidak benar
4735434 dalam ilmu perubatan urutan batin bukan langkah bijak menangani masalah berkaitan alat sulit seperti didakwa pengamal perubatan tradisional kerana urutan hanya akan menimbulkan pelbagai masalah dan berisiko tinggi mendapat penyakit mati pucuk
4735435 kebanyakan tukang urut batin menggunakan kaedah urutan sama seperti anggota badan lain seperti urutan di badan kaki dan tangan kerana mereka tidak mengetahui teknik sebenar urutan pada bahagian berkenaan
4735436 mereka mudah terpedaya dan enggan mempelajari ilmu seks walaupun konsep urutan yang salah di sisi undang undang perubatan ini sudah kerap mendapat liputan akhbar

4735463 wait a minute doc ah are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean

4735470 she provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town and no doubt she will help them set their goals
4735471 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4735472 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4735473 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4735474 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4735475 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4735476 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4735477 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4735480 it has to be done on a weekly basi dont get me wrong if someone comes in and scores and keeps playing well then they retain their position
4735481 places have to be up for grabs if theyre not then what would all those players do if theyre not in
4735482 why would they bother training why would they bother being involved if there are no places up for grabs it wouldnt be worthwhile at all
4735483 they must have some motivation and their motivation is getting in the team the motivation for the ones in the team is to stay in the side
4735484 the motivation has been great among all of them they have all been pushed and their positions have all been challenged thats a good position for me to have
4735485 well see how it pans out if theyre playing well and scoring goals they think they should be in the team and i guess the best thing they can do is play well it gives them a better chance of being in the side
4735486 one or two gave me food for thought thats for sure but its great when people come in and do well
4735487 chris iwelumo did well i said to the players before the game if i picked a team with any of those subs on saturday and left five people out including wayne hennessey because carl ikeme has been excellent i dont think anyone could have argued
4735488 if it had been the two centre forwards matt jarvis and ikeme instead of keogh sylvan neill stears or wardy or wayne none of them could have complained because they have all been terrific whats been really nice of them is they have all supported each other
4735489 even though theyre not in the team they have pushed one another to be in the team which is the best thing you can get good competition for places
4735490 its proven as well because when people have come in theyve played well
4735491 we wanted to beat them more than we did last time

4735516 we set up our fishing activity in 1985 here of course for around two to three years we incurred losses when excess tidal saline water enters our lake it is not favourable we sensed the prospects of this place being a good place for tourism we approached the officials and then the ball was set rolling during off season we breed fish here poomai and chemeen prawns are the prime varieties of fish
4735517 it has been a very good ambience set here with all this nature spreading across backwaters the rafting facility was quite a different thing offered here
4735518 we have a platform for an exhibition depicting our way of making art even though exhibitions usually held here but the process of working and different techniques of an artist have never been displayed people should see it interact because if you dont know the artist it is very difficult to understand his work so we have provided an open platform for the people to come and interact with us
4735519 we have learnt a lot as we are directly interacting with the artists being a student i am getting a great exposure i have always painted by reference drawing but i am learning as how to paint through expressions
4735520 when such events are held they are very useful and enriching i feel so good that we got an opportunity to see a variety of artwork workshops are held in jalandhar and other places in punjab and this adds another jewel to its crown
4735521 we want to make good citizens not just produce clerks we want good citizens good engineers and good doctors

4735595 i dont think of it as work if it seemed like work i think id just give it up its just something i like and enjoy and theres so much to write about
4735596 theres lots of things ive changed my mind about for instance when i started out i never had bonds i was thinking if stocks are going to beat bonds in the long run why even bother that by the way is a question i ask myself all the time but ive changed my mind over the years you need bonds to reduce the volatility in your portfolio
4735597 i thought it would only be fair if i put my own neck out there with a few ideas of what id do with 40 million of capital if i flame out therell be no secret about that

4735602 when we asked her about the blood stains she said that suman name of the boy has cut his fingers over a bonti and ran away but we did not believe her and informed the police
4735603 i returned home at 4 30pm and asked sabita about suman she told me he has cut his fingers and fled away i grew suspicious seeing blood all over the floor but i never imagined that she may kill her son
4735604 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4735605 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4735606 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4735607 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4735608 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4735609 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4735610 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4735611 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4735612 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4735613 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4735614 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4735615 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4735616 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4735617 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4735618 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4735619 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4735620 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4735621 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4735622 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4735623 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4735624 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4735625 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4735626 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4735627 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4735628 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4735629 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4735630 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4735631 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4735632 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4735633 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4735635 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4735636 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4735637 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4735638 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4735639 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4735640 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4735641 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4735642 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4735643 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4735644 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4735645 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4735646 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4735650 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4735651 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4735652 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4735653 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4735654 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4735655 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4735656 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4735657 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4735658 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4735659 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4735660 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4735661 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4735662 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4735663 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4735664 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4735665 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4735666 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4735667 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

4735680 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4735681 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4735682 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4735683 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4735689 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4735690 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4735691 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4735702 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4735703 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4735704 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4735705 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4735706 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4735707 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4735708 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4735709 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4735710 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4735712 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4735713 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4735714 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4735715 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4735716 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4735717 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4735718 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4735720 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4735721 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4735722 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4735742 in the past few days several of the big financiers of illegal logging here have been very active trying to portray the anti illegal logging task force and the church as anti poor because they claim that we are taking away the livelihood of the poor

4735772 su paso por la escuela cuando lo ha habido ha sido ineficaz pues los valores transmitidos imprescindibles para una buena integraci n social al sistema general se presentan disfuncionales para vivir entre los suyos y no son asumidos por el alumno gitano que ha de desenvolverse en su mundo en su barrio con su gente
4735773 si a un ni o gitano se le ofrece la misma educaci n que a un payo no debe tener problemas para adaptarse a la sociedad
4735774 los gitanos no quieren adaptarse a la sociedad quieren que la sociedad se adapte a ellos
4735775 el que se integra ha desaparecido si ahora mismo cogemos una botella de buen vino y la metemos en un r o a los pocos segundos no queda ni gota eso es desaparecer o integrarse eso es desaparecer como somos una minor a si nos integramos en el pueblo payo que es mayor a vamos a desaparecer y nosotros no queremos perder nuestra identidad nuestra cultura es tradicional oralmente transmitida y no queremos perderla yo quiero convivir socialmente pero sin destruir mi condici n de gitano porque para nosotros el ser gitano es lo m s grande del mundo

4735794 dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety

4735813 when it first happened i pretty much knew exactly what it was
4735814 while i was laying on the floor i realized i couldnt pick myself up off the ground so i knew something was really wrong
4735815 one of the first things that came into mind the mike cook play from pittsburgh it was the same exact move i spoke to mike a little after that game he said he knew exactly what it was
4735816 i went into the back tried to cut and just couldnt do it
4735817 and actually its not the hardest one either ive been through worse i know all i have to do is put in the work
4735818 i guess its safe to say ive played my last game in a bulls uniform

4735821 its always tough its funny to play each other in the semis here we know each other so well what we like and what we dont like
4735822 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better said dechy who hasnt reached a semifinal since last augusts tier iv event at forest hills
4735823 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen wozniak said
4735824 if i would have had a little more focus i could have held serve and won the first set 6 3 but she has a lot of experience she was battling for every point even when she was down 5 2
4735825 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4735826 i was able to play my game in the second set and i guess she had trouble with it lusicki said
4735827 i was fighting it it still hurts ill have to get treatment on it and get ready for the u s open
4735828 i think this was my easiest match against her but i didnt exactly play my best petrova said

4735846 its always been an amazing experience for me last year i was at the under 23 level and this year i jumped into senior level with ramon and we went from a c final 13 to 18 place at munich to fifth in the a final in the olympics
4735847 for me its just a major achievement to be up there racing with the best in the world im just disappointed that we never got a medal for as much as they are the best in the world we want to be better
4735848 its been pushing and squeezing every day to try and get up to speed in six months i think this last race was just a bit too much for us
4735849 theres been anxiety and nerves every day to get up there because we have to improve thats not a normal training environment and it took a lot out of us but weve been up to the challenge
4735850 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4735851 all the parties appear to be agreeable to reaching an agreement this weekend but its a wait and see situation

4735857 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4735858 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4735859 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4735860 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4735861 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4735862 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4735863 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4735864 pls dont adjust my chair if you are working on my desk pls be considerate
4735865 how insensitive i must have seemed when he told me that he loved me how unmoved and cold i must have seemed when he told me so sincerely why he must have asked did i just turn and stare in icy silence what was i to say what can you say when a love affair is over now hes gone away and im alone with a memory of his last look vague and drawn and sad i see it still all the heartbreak in his last look how he must have asked did i just turn and stare in icy silence what was i to say what can you say when a love affair is over
4735866 i dont know how i would feel if that happened
4735867 you know i just basically dont give a shit anyway
4735868 we really dont need to understand what marx or lenin or stalin wrote because they are just gangsters not smart men just nihilists and we can beat them because we are the good guys
4735869 well where were sitting right now used to be underwater
4735870 but youre probably talking about the pool garden they drain it mid september and use it as tennis courts
4735871 they squirm around here after it rains and its squishy going
4735872 the bay bottom is very soft and there are dangerous gullies
4735873 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4735874 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4735875 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4735876 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4735877 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4735878 if im showing a picasso i want them to see a picasso
4735879 those who dont care about their companions are even worse than trash
4735880 bien s r que je serai l car je sais que je ne pourrais as vivre les 40 ans de dallas car jai 76 ans
4735881 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4735882 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4735883 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4735884 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4735885 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4735886 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4735887 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4735888 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4735889 je suis venue vous dire ma tristesse pour tout ce qui se passe au tibet pour votre peuple

4735894 tous les hommes et les femmes de bonne volont doivent aujourdhui bouger pour quune solution pacifique soit trouv e ce drame terrible qui frappe aujourdhui le tibet

4735900 general amherst was the guy that had blankets inoculated with small pox and had them given to native people as gifts
4735901 when it comes to linking specifically general amherst to the mikmaq we dont have any clear documentation that things like germ warfare were carried out
4735902 lets put it this way in the future i dont think there should ever be anything named after people who committed what can be described as crimes against humanity i dont see why this should be any exception
4735903 hes part of history so is amherst nothing says that you have to idolize them phony history is not in the best interest of anybody
4735904 i know theres some people around that are gonna be difficult to deal with but i think were fighting the good fight and were gonna go with it til the end
4735905 its in no way a name that was selected to glorify or to honour a particular person its a name used by the british to name the fort and its now a historic place name that has been used for the last 250 years
4735906 i think fort amherst is fine i dont really know all the history all i can say is its just been fort amherst for so long
4735907 its been that way for centuries its just part of the local fabric fort amherst has been there as long as i can remember
4735908 it might be a good policy for canada to recognize our people
4735909 but since it was established by the french why not give it the original french name i would be in favour of that
4735910 i guess anyone could potentially ask for a name change we would review it and determine if its appropriate
4735911 to have a place named after general amherst would be like having a city in jerusalem named after adolf hitler its disgusting
4735912 i dont generally comment on people who quote adolf hitler or make comparisons to him
4735913 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4735914 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4735915 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4735916 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4735917 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4735918 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4735919 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4735920 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4735921 from my point of view this deal is not directed against russia
4735922 we will continue to advocate that talks be continued on how we can convince russia of this and also include it
4735923 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4735924 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4735925 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4735926 after the tanks were cooled down enough firefighters were able to get on the catwalks and introduce foam onto the fires
4735927 a majority of our fifth and eighth grade students deserve our congratulations because they have met this important promotion requirement but clearly we have more work to do to help all students pass the math exam
4735928 it slowed us down a little bit but we kept the pit hot enough so we could still compete today
4735929 im so pleased with the eighth grade and immediately after that the boys won the track meet at lancaster the eighth grade is winning both in the classroom and in athletics as well
4735930 the issue is now with the supreme court lets wait for its ruling and all will have to submit to it when it comes the highest tribunal is the final aribter it will rise above the din and noise created by less noble considerations
4735931 yes there are political dynamics we are working to sort them out the government will assume a supporting role and let non government organizations support on the peace efforts spearhead the discussions for the problematic concerns we want to end the conflict that clearly claimed more than 120 000 lives
4735932 because if it is struck down the government is going to lose face will the other side milf still believe them
4735933 what if the sc strikes down the moa there will no longer be a peace process if there is no peace process what will we have
4735934 what were seeing now is the difficulty of moving forward if the court strikes it down its not a simple problem
4735935 the thing is its a negotiation you agreed when you talk about renegotiation after a strike by sc there will be many psychological elements that includes loss of face
4735936 im sure well talk about how we can move forward
4735937 whats clear is we cannot stop the negotiations thats how important peace is nagkakagulo na nga uli e
4735938 let us not play around with peace the alternative to peace is war it is best that everyone christians muslims lumad government officials politicians leaders of civil society congress and those in the judiciary must all treat the pending issue with sobriety and circumspection and with abiding resolve that all must contribute to install peace in the land
4735939 we are almost there lets not miss this rare opportunity of finding peace in the land
4735940 focused and resolute to fine a final settlement in the mindanao conflict
4735941 when peace comes development follows this is not only for mindanao
4735942 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4735943 we further strongly oppose provisions in the moa ad granting the milf through the bangsamoro juridical entity bje exclusive ownership over the bangsamoro homeland and removing this area from the public domain
4735944 we believe that lasting peace in mindanao should be done within the territorial integrity of the philippines
4735945 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4735946 the job market is in the worst most chaotic state ive ever seen it in fixed income ive been doing this for over 30 years and ive never seen anything like this
4735947 following the global credit crunch that started a year ago
4735948 7 1 of the 2007 peak will be cut by june 2009

4735969 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better

4736063 apa yang berlaku dalam konteks saiful bukhari bersumpah memperlihatkan keganjilan bilamana sepatutnya yang bersumpah adalah pihak yang kena tuduh tetapi apa yang berlaku adalah pihak yang menuduh
4736064 mendengar saiful melibatkan memohon kepada allah melaknatinya beserta keluarga dan keturunannya tanpa menyebutkan berapa lama seolah olah sampai ke hari kiamat mana ada sumpah yang meminta allah melaknati keturunan
4736065 tidak sepatutnya keturunan yang akan mewarisi kita dilaknati allah bersama atas permintaan kita sedangkan mereka keluarga tidak melakukan kesalahan
4736066 saya tidak nampak ini suatu cara yang sebenarnya berlaku dalam hukum syarak
4736067 iaitu siapa yang menasihati dirinya sama ada orang politik atau siapa
4736068 ianya seolah olah tidak diprogramkan secara teliti dengan persiapan yang tidak cukup sehingga sampai ke peringkat menyebutkan kalimah sumpah pun tersasul
4736069 ianya dibuat secara tergesa gesa sebab dirujuk kepada orang yang benar benar mengetahui prosiding sumpah sperti ini atau mungkin saiful tidak diberi penerangan yang sejelas jelasnya tentang akibat sumpah
4736070 kenapa beliau tidak boleh menunggu sehingga proses mahkamah berjalan dan hukuman dijatuhkan dan apa kepentingan dirinya untuk bersumpah

4736112 he is only 22 and has played the last number of internationals and the olympics so id hope we will get him all right
4736113 if there are clubs interested they just need to get in touch with us
4736114 he needs regular football hes been out for two years now and there is no guarantee of a position here that wont do him any good so we will let him go out until january

4736184 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4736185 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4736186 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4736187 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4736191 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4736192 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4736193 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4736194 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4736195 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4736196 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof
4736197 dude youre not even inhaling youre such a fucken puss
4736198 this is crestview childrens hospital your son has been in an accident
4736199 its a massive game for leon as hes playing against his hometown club if anybody is going to be up for this game its him
4736200 its only one game well look at the table again after 10 games and if were still up there then fantastic the important thing is we have the monkey off our backs as we lost the first six games last year
4736201 i dont see why we cant go there and give the same performance as last week against burnley we got off to a flier beating them which was always a winnable game
4736202 wolves too is winnable if we go with the same attitude we should come out on top
4736203 i feel that i have let the country down by winning only a single bronze through four olympics
4736204 i dedicated the best part of my youth to shooting while a bronze is less valuable than a gold it is nevertheless good enough for me i now would like to spend more time with my mother but of course if the country needs me i would continue shooting
4736205 i am going to go back and see what else i can do to help im keeping in touch with all the guys down there all the volunteers
4736206 people consider this generation to be self centered westernized and lacking a sense of responsibility
4736207 i think the earthquake is not only a tragedy but an opportunity for us to grow up
4736208 ive seen so many things ive never seen in my 26 years of life
4736209 and we all barged through it is difficult to see how they close it again
4736210 wir sitzen wieder bis abends auf der veranda das haben wir unserem herrn pr sidenten zu verdanken
4736211 captured with a canon 5d with a 70 200mm canon l using a matching 1 4x multiplier
4736212 this is the most amount of three putts ive ever had here if i just putted normal today i would have given phil a run it was frustrating its the best ive hit it in years just the way you want to hit it in a major championship but i absolutely lost it on the greens im probably going to go snap this putter in about eight pieces
4736213 with all this focus on his swing putting is the one thing thats gone neglected but hes worked hard on it and its starting to show
4736214 i keep very comprehensive details of tigers statistics no question the difference between his winning and not winning comes down to putting my statistics tell you that if he plays 72 holes without a three putt his chances of a victory are about 80 percent in 2000 he had several stretches of more than 100 straight holes without a three putt i believe he got to 258 at one point he had only one stretch longer than 100 holes this year
4736215 tiger woods its frustrating because i didnt win simple as that i felt like i was playing so well coming into this event and i was its unfortunate that i just didnt continue that way that first day when i played decent but putted so poorly it just put me so far back that it was very frustrating q inaudible tiger woods first day was mechanics today i just didnt feel it at all to feel that poorly over a putt is just very unusual especially this year
4736216 as tiger woods signed his scorecard near the 18th green a member of his entourage had his putter and mimicked snapping it over his knee woods caddie agreed
4736217 as good as i hit it today thats as bad as i putted it was frustrating i felt in so much control of my ball from tee to green the best i have hit it in years the final round of a major thats exactly how you want to hit it but then again i absolutely lost it out there on the greens i putted so bad i am probably going to go snap this putter in about eight pieces
4736218 the way i controlled my ball today i felt like today was the day
4736219 if i would have just putted normal i didnt have to play great just had to putt normal i had so many putts in there inside 10 feet for birdies and eagles and i missed them all
4736220 if i knew what went wrong i would have fixed it
4736221 i was both pulling them and pushing them bad speed short long you name it i had it all today
4736222 done in by a horrible day on the greens for the first time in a major championship in which he was in contention woods fell short in his bid to win his fifth masters and his 11th major title sunday
4736223 as good as i hit it thats as bad as i putted it i felt so in control of my game but once i got on the green i was a spaz
4736224 this is the most amount of three putts ive ever had here
4736225 if i just putted normal today i would have given phil a run
4736226 it was frustrating its the best ive hit it in years just the way you want to hit it in a major championship but i absolutely lost it on the greens im probably going to go snap this putter in about eight pieces
4736227 if i knew i would have fixed it i was pulling em pushing em bad speed missing short and long you name it and i did it
4736228 the missing piece for woods was his putting at hoylake he prevailed even though he had three three putts on the back nine on saturday typical of an uneven year on the greens
4736229 with all this focus on his swing its the one thing thats gone neglected
4736230 but hes worked hard on it and its starting to show
4736231 but he was equally proud of the most boring shot in golf a special gift for swing coach hank haney
4736232 he told me saturday afternoon hank youve never seen me putt good
4736233 and i told him after he got done ive seen you putt good now
4736234 i just felt like if i got the ball anywhere on the green i could make it
4736235 its not too often you get days like that and i happened to have it on the final round of a major championship
4736236 on woods putting struggles in the first half of 06
4736237 woods was undone by uncharacteristically poor putting missing a putt from less than three feet at the ninth
4736238 i felt like i hit the ball pretty decent all day but i just didnt make any putts
4736239 i had my chances but had a hard time with my pace on the greens
4736240 q was the lead tape on the putter today tiger woods yeah well the whole idea like i told stevie when we did it was to build continuity for next two tournaments this tournament and the next because you know the british open never has fast greens so it was nice to have an adjustment like ive made for this week probably going to last until the next event
4736241 woods has lost his past two tournaments in large part because of his putter this week he had 28 putts thursday 31 on friday and saturday and 30 on sunday
4736242 i didnt make the putts i needed to make this entire week i had the speed just didnt get the line right you have good weeks and have bad weeks certainly this was not one of my best
4736243 dont ever speed up the normal timing of your downstroke
4736244 we fit the club to the swing not the other way around
4736245 based upon your data what do you say to a student so that his effort at the skill generates data more closely mirroring the
4736246 why is it essential that you develop a quiet eye when you putt its simple your hands are controlled by your brain which gets valuable information about what to do from your eyes as you putt your brain needs to organize more than 100 billion neurons these neural networks are informed by your gaze and control your hands arms and body as the stroke is performed these networks will stay organized for only a short period of time a window of opportunity opens that must be used when it is at its most optimal
4736247 align the line of his throat or neck to match the top edge of the putter face
4736248 i think he just has such a strong sense of belief in himself that hes just never out of it
4736249 hes never going to mess up hes just always in control he never loses his composure
4736250 he gets mad thats not what im referring to but he never loses his composure he always stays very poised and he doesnt very often throw away a shot
4736251 my father was the same way anyone in here who knows my mom my mom is probably more fiery than my dad thats kind of the household i grew up in
4736252 we were always competitive you never backed down to anybody and thats the fun part about competing its the fun thing about playing sports my dad in his former occupation you back down you die so you cant have that mentality
4736253 getting the heck out of dodge the quickest and shortest way possible
4736254 the idea of me as a controlling father is 180 degrees from the truth he says it was never a question of me forcing tiger to play golf everything came from him we transcended the father son thing when he was five we became best friends equals the normal way of things is that the father is always in command that wasnt the case with us because when we went to a golf tournament i would be the father until we signed in then tiger took over as the father and i was the son he would tell me what time we had to get there when his tee time was he learnt to compute travel time and warm up time and practice time after the tournament was finished he would always practise he would tell me when it was time to go home and then as we were checking out of the hotel or going to the airport our roles were reversed back again i became the father again

4736256 when doc nall was there with me working on russell fear real fear hit me fear like i had never known before fear comes and once you recognize it and accept it it passes just as fast as it comes and you dont really think about it anymore you just do what you have to do but you learn the real meaning of fear and life and death for the next two hours i was alone on that gun shooting at the enemy
4736257 that place sucks its for white people people had better be glad that the scots lived there instead of the soul brothers or golf would never have been invented we wouldnt have been stupid enough to go out in that weather and play a silly ass game and freeze to death we would have stayed inside listening to jazz laughing and joking and drinking rum
4736258 he didnt drink before he went to stanford but this time he came home for thanksgiving and i was lying on my bed having a drink and he says
4736259 its a war but it is also an exquisite pleasure
4736260 the laser gizmo will certainly confirm his problem but how will it actually remedy it i suppose it will give him an idea how badly his alignment is biased but after that what good is the thing
4736261 suck the know how for the physical motion out of the use of the aid
4736262 immediate feedback in the form of knowledge of results or kr
4736263 wrong assessment objective reality of putter face aim from laser does not agree with golfers assessment
4736264 or kp but that is only possible assuming the golfer knows in advance
4736265 a final distinction that can be made is between knowledge of results and knowledge of performance the former refers to how well one did at executing a task in terms of the outcome of the action the latter refers to the action or movement pattern involved in the skill e
4736266 your elbow was bent when you tried to hit the ball
4736267 a surprising general finding from research on the importance of feedback kr to ultimate performance is that it rarely helps and sometimes actually hurts long term learning
4736268 most research on feedback has looked at the effectiveness of knowledge of results kr schmidt 1988 provides a thorough review of much of the literature pertaining to motor learning an interesting finding from his laboratory is that if the feedback on results is provided after each trial immediate practice performance is better than when only summary performance is given every 15 trials delayed intermittent summary kr however long term or ultimate learning is facilitated by giving only summary feedback intermittently such as after 15 trials
4736269 a general principle seems to be that identical elements are necessary
4736270 mastery of a task requires learning the pool of relevant stimulus cues learning to perform the response repertoire and learning the relationship between the cue context and the responses
4736271 an important conclusion from this research is that once automatic responses are attained to a stimulus set eg training aid device with specific cues some if not most of which are irrelevant in comparison to available on course performance cues changes in even part of that set will substantially disrupt performance if lengthy training leads to automatic responses to task irrelevant stimuli which are not similarly linked to those responses in the transfer context ie on the course transfer performance will be impaired ie on course putting will sort of suck
4736272 in order to execute the appropriate actions in play a person needs to be able to recognize the cue in the target task play situation as the same cue that was used for training
4736273 an explanation for the lack of long term benefit from error feedback immediate kr of the
4736274 the studies provide strong support for the benefits of abstract instruction but it is important to emphasize that abstract instruction in the absence of concrete examples rarely results in transfer
4736275 although concrete experience is critically important the teaching of abstract principles has been shown to play a role in acquiring skills over a broad domain of tasks ie useful in a wide array of situations during play somewhat surprisingly giving immediate and constant feedback may fail to optimize performance delayed and intermittent feedback of the kr sort may produce superior results because it allows learners to detect and self correct errors and it diminishes reliance on extrinsic sources ie training device with irrelevant cues
4736276 the motor learning literature and clinical practice protocols are surprisingly consistent in showing that during the practice phase in most tasks nearly any variation that increases the availability eg immediacy precision frequency number of channels of information feedback benefits performance and increases the rate of improvement over trials because performance benefits from such conditions it is easy to assume that these conditions also benefit learning and retention recent research however has revealed that certain variations of kr that provide information feedback less often during practice prove to be more beneficial for long term learning and retention than practice conditions with feedback provided more often these feedback variations that appear to enhance learning pertain to the scheduling of kr during practice and include 1 kr relative frequency which is the proportion of trials receiving kr 2 bandwidth kr which provides kr after trials for which performance is outside a given error tolerance range and 3 kr delay which provides kr following some temporal delay after completion of a response
4736277 these findings run counter to the conventional viewpoint that less frequent kr should degrade learning
4736278 oh well thats probably not going to be a birdie but my chances of getting the ball out of the rough onto the green and two putting for par are still very high so bogey is not much in play at this point at least until i assess my actual lie
4736279 success on the green pga tour pros secrets for putting your best
4736280 theres no one technique that fits all the important thing is to find a style with which you are comfortable each of our professionals has a different technique and in some cases a different length putter all are successful while their individual styles may not suit you much can be learned from their advice drills and practice lessons
4736281 in skills such as putting a subject is not aware of the moving of the eyes as being separate from moving the head shoulder trunk or other muscle systems
4736282 all ive done is pay into the bbcs pension fund
4736283 our staff deserve bonuses i personally believe that its right for people to take bonuses mine was cut by 40 per cent this year and i think thats right i do think i have to take some of the responsibility for some of the lapses in editorial standards that occurred across radio in the past few years
4736284 but over the next few years weve got to deliver efficiencies like everyone else in the public sector
4736285 one of the reasons why i feel confident that the bbc recognises the importance of radio is that it didnt ask radio for the same level of efficiencies that it asked television it asked for significantly less because it recognised the impact
4736286 there were insufficient systems in place to prevent or identify the unfair conduct that occurred this was totally unacceptable
4736287 the deliberate decision to fake a winner in this pre recorded edition of russell brand was taken with the full knowledge of the bbc 6music head of programmes
4736288 these werent premium rate telephone services as we know them
4736289 they were normally just ordinary calls or if they were emails there was no charge at all so thats one reason why the fines are of a different order
4736290 what weve done is impose a penalty which to us appears proportionate to the seriousness of the offences but also appropriate to the fact that its effectively public money which is being taken from the bbc
4736291 the regulatory system is flawed because the bbc is not a commercial company whose shareholders would be hurt by such a move it is a public institution
4736292 fining the bbc is akin to imposing a tax upon a tax the treasury will benefit but licence fee payers through no fault of their own will suffer from the inevitable drop in programme budgets and hence the quality of programmes provided by the bbc
4736293 the loss of licence fee payers money as a result
4736294 it tastes excellent not unlike venison only a different flavour
4736295 the part of the waistcloth that falls below the ankles is in the fire
4736296 whoever treads on his waistcloth in pride will tread on it in the fire
4736297 on the day of resurrection allah will not look at the one who dragged his garment out of pride
4736298 o messenger of allah my waistcloth slips down if i do not pay attention to it
4736299 you are not one of those who do it out of pride
4736300 do not worry about it because you did not let it slip on purpose
4736301 why do we find some texts on the subject fail to mention the condition of pride
4736302 this is because letting ones garments hang below the ankle gives an impression of pride and is therefore disliked as is anything else that gives an impression something sinful

4736412 widely denounced by activists clerics and others who say such unions are harmful to the children and trivialise the institution of marriage saudi arabia is already rocked by a high divorce rate that has jumped from 25 per cent to 60 per cent over the past 20 years there are no laws in saudi arabia defining the minimum age for marriage though a womans consent is legally required some marriage officials do not seek it for example a father can marry off a one year old girl as long as sex is delayed until she reaches puberty there are no statistics to show how many marriages involving children are performed every year and its also not clear whether these unions are on the rise or whether people are hearing about them more now because of the prevalence of media outlets and easy access to the internet but the phenomenon is not new said shaikh mohammad al nujaimi a strong opponent of the marriages he and other clerics activists and writers have urged the government to pass legislation setting the minimum age for marriage and to resolve differences among the kingdoms religious authorities over the issue

4736521 het doel blijft de finale en een goede tijd natuurlijk we hebben wel nog nooit in groep gelopen want in onze vorige wedstrijden lagen we altijd ver voorop op de spelen hebben de anderen zo veel ervaring dat ze gewoonweg blijven staan om de achterkomende aflossingen te hinderen maar ik vrees er niet voor we hebben getraind op chaotische aflossingen en de broers borl e lossen elkaar af na de eerste ronde wanneer iedereen nog in banen loopt
4736522 we zijn allemaal goed in vorm en gaan dus volop voor een plaats in de finale die plaats is ook belangrijker dan de tijd die we lopen de trainingen in yantai zijn goed verlopen we voelen dat we nog een grote groeimarge hebben
4736523 de bedoeling is ook om individueel ervaring op te doen
4736524 maandagmorgen zal ik in de reeksen van de 400 m voluit lopen niemand heeft me de indruk gegeven dat ik me moet inhouden met het oog op de 4x400 m integendeel de individuele 400 m zal ons helpen voor de aflossing al is het maar omdat we dan alles al eens meegemaakt zullen hebben de opwarming de wachtruimte het binnenkomen in het stadion ik kan niet wachten om te lopen eigenlijk
4736525 als ik in vorm ben vertrek ik altijd om het belgisch record te verbreken

4736534 it will be interesting to see if the impact is the same this year as last year when we had terrific media coverage
4736535 a group of world citizens sharing a common concern for the future of humanity
4736536 if the present growth trends in world population industrialization pollution food production and resource depletion continue unchanged the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity
4736537 it is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future the state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential
4736538 the overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth rate loop is a recent phenomenon a result of mankinds very successful reduction of worldwide mortality the controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint there are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new lower death rate or the death rate must rise again
4736539 the result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985 with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food industrial output and services per person eventually however resource shortages reduce industrial output and the temporarily stable state degenerates
4736540 man possesses for a small moment in his history the most powerful combination of knowledge tools and resources the world has ever known he has all that is physically necessary to create a totally new form of human society one that would be built to last for generations the two missing ingredients are a realistic long term goal that can guide mankind to the equilibrium society and the human will to achieve that goal
4736541 without such a goal and a commitment to it short term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and ultimate collapse with that goal and that commitment mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium
4736542 this is the way we are setting the scene for mankinds encounter with the planet
4736543 modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the earths natural regenerative and life supporting capacity
4736544 at current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years
4736545 gaia our mother who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution is dying
4736546 a small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for earth
4736547 a radical change from the current trajectory is required a complete reordering of global society
4736548 humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy
4736549 at this time a new enemy must be found one either real or invented for the purpose
4736550 democracy has failed us a new system of global governance based on environmental imperatives must be implemented quickly
4736551 isnt the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse isnt it our responsiblity to bring that about
4736552 a massive campaign must be launched to de develop the united states de development means bringing our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and the world resource situation
4736553 the prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet
4736554 my three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness with its full complement of species returning throughout the world
4736555 a total population of 250 300 million people a 95 decline from present levels would be ideal
4736556 the extinction of the human species may not only be inevitable but a good thing
4736557 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected

4736559 there were real fears of a breakdown of togetherness in the dream teams camp following head coach samson siasias public upbraiding of the squad for their poor show in the last minutes against usa which did not go down well with the senior players

4736561 things became somewhat hot and odemwingie contemplated leaving the team camp

4736571 this is the grandest stage of swimming if they can take positives away and say ive got four years to make it even better then thats the key
4736572 i received a mail from a friend with part of the scripture im victorious in jesus and i came here with that attitude

4736581 the fact that 10 member unions have signaled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4736582 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signaling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4736583 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time
4736584 this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited and the tournaments commercial partners it also ensures that future development investment initiatives in the game worldwide can continue to be underwritten by the tournament and planned accordingly

4736586 the antiwar activists were basically right to protest the war was waged under a false premise and should never have escalated as it did they made their points very rudely though and it would have been nicer if they had been a little more polite and diplomatic and nixon stepped way over the line and deserved to leave office in disgrace

4736596 are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4736597 put forward serious arguments that need to be heard and struck a resounding chord with the public
4736598 he was actually talking at the time about how to support local food producers in scotland something he knows a lot about i suspect his explosion about farmers going to live in horrible cities wasnt like his denunciation of the modern uk city along the lines of his hideous carbuncle speech it was addressing how if you pursue further industrialisation of agriculture it inevitably means growers are displaced from the land and will end up in mega slums this isnt wild fantasy its describing what is happening
4736599 but farming is right at the top not least because hes a farmer he spends a lot of time on home farm in gloucestershire and takes an immense interest in contemporary farming this year he is patron of the year of food and farming and most small farmers would see him as a friend and advocate
4736600 the daily telegraph interview was given to highlight the north highland initiative thats one of the four or five initiatives he has set up to help farmers products become more competitive by using imaginative marketing solutions
4736601 no but i think he was overstating it if someone asked me what was the most serious issue affecting the environment at the moment id say climate change rather than biotechnology biotechnology is a very important issue there are lots of scientific and health issues connected with it that are still unanswered but the most important issue about biotechnology is that the vast majority of applications which have come out of research into gm have had nothing to solving the problems of poverty hunger and food security and everything to do with extending the control which agri business has over the food chain
4736602 if you do ask how to go about solving those issues biotechnology would be quite low down higher up would be solutions such as giving people more entitlement to the land land reform redirecting agricultural extension services to small farmers and looking at a wide range of sustainable farming techniques which dont rely on invasive high technology approaches but build on farmers existing knowledge
4736603 is that hes talking about corporate control and its effect on agriculture its not exactly leftwing but it is radical i would place him in that tradition of philanthropic experimental landowners like robert owen who does things in a patriarchal and paternalistic way but genuinely wants to leave the world a better place
4736604 but he doesnt strike me as being too concerned about poverty and poverty reduction
4736605 the point is that charles for all his current voice of the people role is someone whose life is wrapped in cotton wool where every whim is catered for and not challenged
4736606 i remember leaving balmoral one evening with the prince of wales in a convoy of four vehicles suddenly to be instructed to return immediately to the castle fearing a real emergency i asked why he told me that he had left an electric light on and not to turn it off would be a terrible waste of electricity so the whole convoy returned to extinguish the light i dont begrudge the prince of wales his reed and lily bed for the natural recycling of liquid waste its just that no one seems to notice how totally at odds it is with all the devotion to detail and excess which is the hallmark of his life at highgrove
4736607 prince charles is who he is and says what he says and thats fine
4736608 but i dont think he should stand as a spokesperson for the broader environmental and social justice system the trouble is we are trapped in a celebrity culture and royalty is part of that there are many voices out there possibly more suited to speak people who know more about the issues in greater depth and from the perspective of global justice but its a celebrity system and celebrities crowd out more informed voices
4736609 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4736610 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4736611 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4736612 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4736613 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the us europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4736646 we are the jailingest motherf ckers on the planet more than that the number of violent offenders in federal prisons has gone down to its lowest level ever in the history of the country in the single digits by the bureau of prisons own statistics and the political party that let this get out of control it was the democrats the drug war has actually destroyed the deterrent in inner cities by teaching whole police departments to chase drug stats when they should be solving crimes and of course because they cant put all those people in prison it doesnt even work as a draconian policy most people are just thrown back onto the street more a smart politician could cite all these things and we could stop the madness but everyones worried that the little old lady in terre haute is going to think youre soft on drugs i think all the little old ladies in terre haute get it the american people are smarter than politicians give them credit for if mccain came to a democratic congress with reforms i think hed be a hero to moderates everywhere because do you know people who believe in the drug war i dont know if theres a cop in baltimore who believes in it except as a means of getting overtime pay i think everybody knows except the government
4736647 we have concluded that our guidance is incorrect in respect of primarily graphical material for this reason we will be amending this section of the guidance note on the vca website by close on 20th june to read as follows
4736648 the regulations define promotional literature as all printed matter used in the marketing advertising and promotion of a new passenger car we are of the view that this definition does include material which is largely graphical with limited textual content perhaps containing only the model name and an advertising slogan we therefore consider that street advertisements are subject to the requirements of the regulations

4736658 some sections of corporate australia seem to think the government is an easy mark at the very least theyre keen to try to call the governments bluff take telstra for example this is not some small widget maker operating in an industrial estate near moorabbin airport its one of the nations major companies at the leading edge of technology and infrastructure delivery telstra could not give a toss about the intent of the new governments industrial relations system which is skewed towards collective bargaining and restores the rights of unions to represent employees leaked internal documents show that it wants to use whats left of workchoices to further de unionise its workforce well into the next decade while also eschewing an updated enterprise agreement according to the documents the company has been working on this strategy since february well before it embarked upon and then pulled out of negotiations on an enterprise agreement with unions under the companys plan workers who signed non union deals would get pay increase of up to 22 while those who opted not to do so would have their pay frozen until late next year and then would receive inferior pay rises even before the documents surfaced telstra had declared that it would no longer negotiate with unions and that it would try to keep as many as possible of its 21 000 employees on australian workplace agreements on those individual contracts after they expire in 2012 the company will not allow any of these workers to opt out of their awas early in order to be covered by a collective agreement in other words it wants to do as much as it can to keep workchoices going this is completely contrary to what gillard promised would be the spirit and intent of labors ir policy before the election and yet here is one of the countrys signature companies quite blatantly thumbing its nose at the government which incidentally has a mandate and many would say an obligation to ditch the central premises of workchoices

4736690 the senators goal was to be tough and smart and so when the action in georgia happened on thursday he immediately called for a ceasefire condemned the unwarranted use of force by russia it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
4736691 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4736692 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4736693 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands

4736731 that was at the very start of the housing boom and the florida condominium market was really driven by speculative flippers who were placing preconstruction deposits and looking to flip these units for quick profits in many cases even before the buildings were complete
4736732 there were a lot of people who got rich doing this

4736760 het doel blijft de finale en een goede tijd natuurlijk we hebben wel nog nooit in groep gelopen want in onze vorige wedstrijden lagen we altijd ver voorop op de spelen hebben de anderen zo veel ervaring dat ze gewoonweg blijven staan om de achterkomende aflossingen te hinderen maar ik vrees er niet voor we hebben getraind op chaotische aflossingen en de broers borl e lossen elkaar af na de eerste ronde wanneer iedereen nog in banen loopt
4736761 we zijn allemaal goed in vorm en gaan dus volop voor een plaats in de finale die plaats is ook belangrijker dan de tijd die we lopen de trainingen in yantai zijn goed verlopen we voelen dat we nog een grote groeimarge hebben
4736762 de bedoeling is ook om individueel ervaring op te doen
4736763 maandagmorgen zal ik in de reeksen van de 400 m voluit lopen niemand heeft me de indruk gegeven dat ik me moet inhouden met het oog op de 4x400 m integendeel de individuele 400 m zal ons helpen voor de aflossing al is het maar omdat we dan alles al eens meegemaakt zullen hebben de opwarming de wachtruimte het binnenkomen in het stadion ik kan niet wachten om te lopen eigenlijk

4736780 ich dachte an einen bildschirmfehler oder dass sich das ergebnis sicher noch ndern wird erst als der heli schrie was normaleweise ein gutes zeichen ist habe ichs kapiert dabei habe ich nach platz sieben im halbfinale an die medaillenchance an das wunder nicht mehr geglaubt vielleicht war ich deshalb so locker solche aufholjagden sind bei uns aber nichts ungew hnliches auf fehler anderer zu hoffen mag ich aber an sich berhaupt nicht
4736781 wir haben das damals verheimlicht damit man mich nicht von der liste streicht ehe ich berhaupt noch draufstehe wir haben das sehr bewusst gemacht weil wir mit leistung berzeugen wollten anfang m rz kam die diagnose am 25 m rz erfolgte im akh linz der eingriff zehn tage sp ter war ich wieder im trainingslager es handelte sich um eine herzrhythmus st rung eine rechtsventrikul re ausflusstachykardie so der fachbegriff bei mir ist das nur bei belastung aufgetreten und war f r sport absolut hinderlich ich musste mich f r den sport oder ein ruhiges leben entscheiden
4736782 die situation ist die gleiche wie bei den sch tzen ich habe aber kein pers nliches problem damit es ist f r mich eine supernebenerscheinung es kann kann nicht das erste ziel sein im interesse der medien zu stehen
4736783 jeder tag jeder lauf jede millisekunde im wildwasser ist anders es gibt immer nur berraschungen da kann man einen lauf auch tausendmal durchgehen das wasser macht immer etwas anderes das f hlt sich wahnsinnig toll an
4736784 das war ein eindeutiger nachteil die anderen konnten da schon in peking trainieren keiner hat f r uns versucht eine lanze zu brechen ob sonst noch mehr m glich gewesen w re ist spekulation die ganze situation mit nur einem einzigen rennen f r den quotenplatz ist problematisch sogar der olympiasieger von athen musste deshalb daheimbleiben
4736785 ich bin total abergl ubisch das h rt ab heute aber sofort auf irgendwann wird es zu viel es f ngt bei der zahnpasta an und h rt damit auf wie oft ich mir vor dem rennen eine ohrfeige gebe normalerweise sind es zwei vor dem finale waren es irrt mlich drei dann habe ich gleich noch eine draufgegeben
4736786 ich f hle mich als sterreichern und verstehe 99 prozent aller dialekte es tut vielmehr meiner deutschen familie weh dass ich in der form mit deutschland nicht mehr verbunden bin
4736787 ich m chte in jedem rennen gut fahren ich will noch viele medaillen au erdem arbeite ich immmer noch am perfekten lauf
4736788 wir m ssen definitiv mehr ins fernsehen die kanu worldseries wo ich gut im rennen um ein auto bin wird teilweise vom weltverband boykottiert in der slowakei sind paddler nationalhelden punkto gef hrlichkeit hat der sport definitiv mehr respekt verdient weil er sehr viel mut erfordert auf der em strecke von 2006 ist ein gest rztes m del mit dem fu an einem am stein h ngegeblieben und f nf meter neben dem trainer j mmerlich ersoffen
4736789 wir sind pure idealisten ohne das bundesheer w rde es nicht gehen wir haben zudem sehr viel gl ck mit unserem ober sterreichischen sponsor energie ag
4736790 dem heli geh ren 90 prozent der medaille er hat mir den kopf
4736791 we have more then enough problems with pedophiles in this society
4736792 about babies being genderless got me thinking its true babies are completely free from the performance that is gender little boy babies and little girl babies dont act differently its sad that this passes so soon and that little girls are quickly taught to play quietly with dolls whilst little boys are encouraged to be active and inquisitive the very things little girls are told off for being
4736793 congress doesnt see what the air force is bringing to the fight
4736794 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4736795 if you add in other risk factors for cardiovascular disease stress or high blood pressure this could be potentially deadly
4736796 the study does not show effects which would go beyond drinking a normal cup of coffee
4736797 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease id think twice about drinking it

4736855 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend

4736858 the league of women voters is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential debate scheduled for mid october because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter
4736859 it has become clear to us that the candidates organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign trail charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions
4736860 the league has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the american public

4736868 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4736869 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4736870 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4736871 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4736872 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4736873 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4736874 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4736875 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4736876 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4736877 this is a planning took where all things are going
4736878 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4736879 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4736880 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4736881 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4736882 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4736883 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4736884 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4736885 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4736886 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4736887 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4736888 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4736889 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4736890 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4736891 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4736892 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4736893 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4736894 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4736895 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4736896 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4736897 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4736898 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4736899 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4736900 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4736901 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4736902 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4736903 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4736904 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4736905 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4736906 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4736907 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4736908 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4736909 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4736910 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4736911 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4736912 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4736913 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4736914 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4736915 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4736916 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4736917 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4736918 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4736919 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4736920 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4736921 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4736922 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4736923 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4736924 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4736925 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4736926 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4736927 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4736928 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4736929 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4736930 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4736931 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4736932 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4736933 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4736934 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4736935 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4736936 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4736937 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4736938 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4736939 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4736940 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4736941 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4736942 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4736943 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4736944 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4736945 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4736946 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4736947 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4736948 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4736949 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4736950 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4736951 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4736952 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4736953 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4736954 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4736955 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4736956 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4736957 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4736958 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4736959 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4736960 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4736961 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4736962 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4736963 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4736964 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4736965 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4736966 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4736967 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4736968 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4736969 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4736970 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

4736989 yes best intentions no security they never are of course you may say you wont interfere with another persons soul but you do merely by existing the snag about it is the practical difficulty so to speak of not existing i mean here we all are you know and what are we to do about it

4736994 what does it matter if it hurts like hell so long as it makes a good book
4736995 now that you have the age of national self realisation the age of colonial expansion the age of the barbarian invasions and the age of the decline and fall all jammed cheek by jowl in time and space all armed alike with poison gas and going through the outward motions of an advanced civilisation principles have become more dangerous than passions its getting uncommonly easy to kill people in large numbers and the first thing a principle does if it is really a principle is to kill somebody one may either hulloo on the inevitable and be called a bloodthirsty progressive or one may try to gain time and be called a blood thirsty reactionary but when blood is their argument all argument is apt to be merely bloody

4737082 we know its not going to be easy because there are no easy games in this league
4737083 i think swindon are a good team theyll be looking to better themselves from last year
4737084 a local derby obviously gives it a little bit of an edge
4737085 at our place were looking to continue the form of last year and im confident that we can take the game to people
4737086 thats the strangest thing for me its the closest game and supporters dont really class it as a derby local amp nations
4737087 we need to get ourselves over the line and over the winning line
4737088 we have to do it we have to put that winning formula together starting on saturday against southend
4737089 robinson is back after suspension other than that im pleased to say we have a clean bill of health and plenty to select from

4737096 i was not a christian for many many years of my life and when i decided to go back to the church i just experienced that there are a lot of people that have that need for a religion and im hoping i can help people
4737097 everybody who came was so struck by what a powerful spiritual experience it was
4737098 he seems to be a great listener and very empathetic and interested in people
4737099 so i think he brings that kind of nurturing which is so important for people that maybe have lost their spouse or their kids are not here in town its almost like church provides a family for people and he just sort of seems to meet people where they are and support them that way
4737100 we got married on may 24 and seven days later on june 1 we moved to berkeley calif for seminary
4737101 it was pretty wild you cant change your life any more than what we did in seven days
4737102 this ordination was as much about my wifes work and triumph as it was about my own studies and work to get to this point
4737103 and of course its all a celebration of what god has done with us
4737104 i was given a snow shovel by one of the congregations
4737105 its this calling that god has called some people to know we have to know the bible back and forth and we have to know human relationships back and forth
4737106 the church wants to grow and i think god wants it to grow too
4737107 you cant focus on numbers you have to focus on ministry if you focus on that take care of the people and the people in the community it will draw people to us
4737108 you spend three months with them day in day out and then you finish your film but you cannot show everything in it just a part of the truth not the whole truth because human life has so many sides and would never fit in one film so you show just a piece of their life and here theres a huge ethical problem a moral dilemma because these are real people and their real lives which you somehow transform by presenting it in some way and this often makes them unhappy and i am not happy that i am doing that you cut into living people in order to make art you cut into living things
4737109 the documentary film for me is essentially a terrible thing

4737112 critical to being able to juggle a scientific career and a young family was having the perfect collaborator a husband who shared all aspects with me from scientific discovery to baby trips to the doctor
4737113 it was a male dominated environment when i first arrived there
4737114 i remember clearly how all astronomers were spoken of as he and never she and there were no family leave policies or tenure clock stop policies at the time to support young scientists and engineers as they started families
4737115 stefi is a very compassionate person ready to listen to each and everyone of us and accommodate our needs
4737116 she has an unending reservoir of energy and was able to stamp her particular leadership style pretty soon after she joined the center
4737117 im a single mom and like stefi i understand the extra effort that is required to carry on with our academic duties while helping our kids to grow up and be responsible citizens

4737146 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
4737147 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
4737148 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
4737149 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated

4737164 the reaction of the players in training on thursday was fantastic
4737165 we were very happy to see them back on the pitch after a bad performance and they showed a high tempo and determination that is what we wanted to see
4737166 i think the reaction was positive and maybe we are talking about a wake up call they know it was a very tough game
4737167 we have one or two players who are not playing very well but as i said before maybe it was a wake up call i am very optimistic for the next game
4737168 the other day i was really concentrating on the game against standard liege
4737169 and now it is the same situation i am really concentrating on sunderland it will be a really tough game
4737170 sunderland have signed some good players it is always tough to play away at sunderland because they have some quality players it could be a physical game but also a game with good football
4737171 it is never easy for a new player to come into a new team especially if the team does not play well
4737172 i was pleased with the way dossena and keane worked against standard liege but i know that they will both play better
4737173 they are both players with quality and they are both internationals so i am sure that they will improve
4737174 sometimes a player can come into a team and do well straight away but usually they need time to adjust
4737175 when we signed skrtel some people were saying he was not good enough after just one game but we all know of his quality now
4737176 they both have a dead leg gerrard is fit its more or less the same situation we had for the last game because gerrard couldnt start
4737177 he will need time as always to get an understanding with torres and get to know all of his team mates
4737178 what sort of system they play in depends on the individual game keane has good movement in between the lines but also up front we can play with both up front or maybe just one
4737179 for a manager when the ball is in attack everything depends on the players you have when you have players with quality and game intelligence like keane and torres it makes it easier for me so maybe i will enjoy it
4737180 our priority is always to try to win every game then you see whether you are a contender or whether you can win this trophy or another
4737181 we will try to do our best in all the competitions but if you had to decide which one you wanted i think all the fans would say the premier league
4737182 thats a good sign because if youre not disappointed then it means you dont care enough but all the lads were really down about it and that makes it much more likely that there will be a positive reaction against sunderland
4737183 we definitely need one because we want to get off to a good start in the league and that means getting a good result today
4737184 sunderland will be difficult to beat because its their first game of the season and theyre playing in front of their own fans so they will definitely be up to this one
4737185 but we need to go there and show we are a good side and good sides dont perform badly twice on the run
4737186 it is a big test but thats what playing for liverpool football club is all about we need a reaction to what happened the other night and hopefully thats exactly what well get
4737187 you cant win the league early in the season but you can certainly lose it and that means we have to try and get ourselves off to the best possible start starting today
4737188 everybody has been talking and it is clear that i am being blamed for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4737189 in this case i want to be clear since i talked with martin oneill in april i havent talked with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4737190 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4737191 i just want to clarify because every time people say oh you were doing this i talked to martin oneill in april and after this i was not in charge
4737192 i talked just with martin oneill i havent had any contact with the owner or the chief executive of aston villa i havent talked with martin oneill since april
4737193 if you want to talk about players talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then talk to me
4737194 we do have some problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4737195 i think we need something on the left but anyway i will continue to try and improve and progress with the players that i have i want to be clear
4737196 i dont have any problem any problem with the owners so i am not talking about anything like this its just that i will try to improve the squad
4737197 we have players in mind i dont think it will be a problem to find players the question is to find the right players for us the right left footed players for us

4737220 theres lots of things ive changed my mind about for instance when i started out i never had bonds i was thinking if stocks are going to beat bonds in the long run why even bother that by the way is a question i ask myself all the time but ive changed my mind over the years you need bonds to reduce the volatility in your portfolio
4737221 i thought it would only be fair if i put my own neck out there with a few ideas of what id do with 40 million of capital if i flame out therell be no secret about that

4737232 if ive had any problems with gordon it was only because i thought he was putting too much pressure on tony to leave when tony wasnt ready
4737233 gordon and i have had our ups and downs and when it came down to it i think gordon would be astonished if i wasnt my husbands biggest supporter im sure gordons wife sarah is his
4737234 gordon brown was put on this planet to show how brilliant tony blair was
4737235 well as his wife i would say that tony is brilliant
4737236 tony always felt that this was a job he couldnt do forever hed always thought two terms or maybe ten years
4737237 i favoured the ten years because it fitted in better with getting the children through school doing their a levels that was from a purely selfish family point of view
4737238 there had been many times before when hed thought he might stand down and i told him i didnt think it was the right time
4737239 im really proud that tony left no10 on his own terms at a time when he left the country and the party in good shape
4737240 its a hard and lonely job being pm and i think tony was absolutely fantastic but when he first went to see the queen he stumbled and fell on her hand instead of just brushing over it with his lips like youre supposed to she told him her first pm was winston churchill i said to him then her tenth pm was going to be as good as winston churchill i in my completely unbiased opinion think he certainly did that
4737241 never tony is a deeply religious person and he takes his wedding vows very seriously hes probably more religious than i am hes the one who has chosen to become a catholic now and he has his morals and takes it seriously im much more lacksidasical
4737242 when he was in no10 he would go to the gym its a great release of the pressure i think hes lost weight more recently because he doesnt have as much stress now that hes not in the job also as prime minister quite often you are literally eating for your country at state functions
4737243 i think to some extent we certainly have got our lives back
4737244 hillary clinton did give me some good advice she said in the end you arent going to be able to win
4737245 there are going to be some things that people will criticise and youve just got to remember the most important thing is to be true to yourself and do what you feel comfortable doing so if thats advice then i pass it on
4737246 there were times where id go into court in the morning after having my hair and make up done because i was going to a function later in the day but id have to try and balance my wig so it didnt completely ruin my hair
4737247 it was a very very busy schedule i was lucky though i had a wonderful nanny and my mum would come up and help
4737248 never tony is a deeply religious person and takes his wedding vows very seriously
4737249 hes probably more religious than i am hes the one who has chosen to become a catholic now he has his morals and takes it seriously im much more lacksadaisical
4737250 to some extent we certainly have got our lives back
4737251 i think hes lost weight because he doesnt have as much stress
4737252 as prime minister quite often you are eating for your country on visits to arab countries if you eat everything on your plate they take that as meaning you havent had enough so they give you more
4737253 its a lonely job being pm and tony was fantastic but when he first went to see the queen he fell on her hand instead of brushing over it with his lips
4737254 she told him that her first pm was winston churchill i said to him her tenth pm was going to be as good as churchill in my unbiased opinion he did that
4737255 instead of which tony felt he had no option but to stay on and fight for the things he believed in
4737256 so i was just terribly partisan for tony and im sure sarah is partisan for gordon and so she should be
4737257 i know that tony thinks gordon could win the election and i know that he has spoken to gordon about how he could do that tony has given gordon advice he and gordon talk to each other even now
4737258 my own reading of the myth that is that a deal was done at granita was that gordon didnt want to admit that hes agreed anything without first discussing it with his people
4737259 after all she was the one that had to listen to tony night after night complaining about what a nightmare gordon was
4737260 if you agree with gordon one term only dont come back home
4737261 it was always a given that they would work in tandem and that when tony stood down gordon would take over tony also made it clear to gordon that he had no intention of staying leader forever and that when he did stand down he would support gordon as his natural successor assuming they worked well together in the meantime
4737262 as far as i know the timing was never discussed but when tony left for lyndseys i made my position perfectly clear even if i framed it as a joke
4737263 bla bla kommentare 1 geben da schon mehr zu denken
4737264 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4737265 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4737266 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4737267 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4737268 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4737269 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4737270 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4737271 we will be monitoring the situation closely and we will be talking with the airlines closer to the strike dates
4737272 however we would advise all passengers who have booked to fly on those days into gatwick or stanstead or from those two airports to belfast to contact their airline for advice
4737273 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4737274 swissport is working with the airport operator and the customer airlines to minimise disruption to the travelling public
4737275 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4737276 this result is just the first to be declared with positive ballot results expected over the next few days at stansted and manchester airports
4737277 swissport workers will also shortly be balloted at birmingham and newcastle airports which could see an escalation of industrial action across the uks airports
4737278 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4737279 gmb members can not afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4737280 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4737281 in putting together the production great care was taken to make every element as good as possible for the occasion and fully appropriate the space
4737282 we consulted widely sourced the best options available locally and where there were gaps we went further afield to complete the presentation
4737283 i think belfast is about to enter a really golden period for live music
4737284 cristiano has been doing excellently he is well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised the condition he was in
4737285 the next three weeks he will have rehab and then the next part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4737286 there has been no problem his progress has been great he has never missed a session morning or afternoon we are pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4737287 at the start of last season i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 25 goals and i replied i was looking for improvement
4737288 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season 42 goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve that given the talent of the boy and his goalscoring ability but you have to say it is a big target
4737289 we call on the british government to apologise for the immense suffering that has resulted from their imposition of section 377 and we call on the indian government to abandon this abhorrent alien legacy of the raj that should have left our shores when the british did
4737290 were going to have to see but i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games the proof will be in the pudding but hopefully i will be fine
4737291 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully touch wood i will be able to do that
4737292 its been tough the toughest part of my career so far definitely
4737293 obviously there are rumours and everything there were times that it did get on top of me you have your friends and family and you need those people around you to keep you going
4737294 the first impressions were probably not the best managers like fit players and i wasnt fit at the time
4737295 then he doesnt really know the history of everything that comes with it i admit it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4737296 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4737297 he had a serious injury which means we have to treat him differently to the rest of the squad and take it game by game to see how his knee responds
4737298 i dont think we want to talk about it too much but within the group and in the changing room we definitely believe we have the players capable of achieving that
4737299 deep down inside well be disappointed if we dont as players and a club we realise it is the next step for us
4737300 weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it
4737301 there are 38 games and every one is tough you have to be willing to grind out results when youre not playing so well and get results away from home
4737302 weve not been doing that and well have to do that if we want to break in the top four
4737303 we came to chens residence and his office to investigate the case this morning the former president and his wife wu shu chen explained transactions of the funds
4737304 we have notified them to return to taiwan as soon as possible for the investigation through the former president
4737305 i couldnt have been asked to shoot against a better shooter
4737306 i hoped he wouldnt miss because tore and me are really good friends but i could feel the nervousness building inside me so i was hoping it wouldnt last much longer
4737307 it had to be my day otherwise how can one think of defeating like likes of ralf christian and others
4737308 why not it is a good feeling to get medals
4737309 i will go to london and focus at the age of 50

4737315 it is impossible to win the championship without a world class goalkeeper and a world class striker and liverpool has both of these last season when the club bought fernando torres the spine of the team was completed pepe reina jamie carragher steven gerrard and torres
4737316 reina underlined his importance to the team again on wednesday night with his penalty save against liege and i know from first hand experience that his penalty saves are no flukes while i think everyone knows the respect i have for gerrard
4737317 as for torres benitez should take enormous credit for not only bringing spains superstar to anfield but making him a better player too you saw him grow through last season and at euro 2008 he will score at least 20 goals again this season with robbie keane at his side maybe he can even break 30 in the league
4737318 on top of all of that liverpool also has anfield on their side and they must use that to their advantage soon to win a title before they move grounds it is an incredible stadium i have so many emotional memories of taking my chelsea team there and i quickly learned what a tough tough ground it is to visit
4737319 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4737320 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4737321 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands
4737322 its roughly the same number we were down from the early bird sales last year people were renewing based on the fact we had finished in the play offs
4737323 there was huge excitement because wed finished fifth and fans felt wed improve seventh was a disappointment to where we finished the previous year
4737324 this time im not sure fans have picked up on the enthusiasm there is within molineux maybe because people are on holidays
4737325 there is a really big buzz within molineux about the season and that has manifested itself within the squad
4737326 were having to almost remind the players to keep a lid on their expectations and excitement for the new season
4737327 weve only just started the season but theres a general feeling of excitement and we hope that continues as the season unfolds
4737328 were keen to have a more focused squad because we carried a large squad last season although quite a few were youngsters who didnt play
4737329 we hope that feeling of excitement catches on with the fans and that brings additional season ticket sales
4737330 im hoping we can eke away at the deficit so we get closer to the total we had last year
4737331 if we start well and win some games im sure well sell more season tickets as we usually do at this time
4737332 we want to keep the expectations in check but we cant wait for the first game of the season
4737333 we have a young squad thats so enthusiastic and hopefully we can produce exciting football
4737334 we want to entertain our fans and if we do that the players will enjoy playing and the fans will enjoy watching hopefully if that happens then hopefully success will follow
4737335 everyone from the administration staff to the players fans manager and media is hoping for a really positive season on all fronts
4737336 with steve morgan trying to support us with our recruitment aims there are many reasons to be optimistic
4737337 we think we have signed four excellent players in sam vokes richard stearman david jones and chris iwelumo and our player recruitment drive hasnt finished
4737338 were still looking at one or two more players to strengthen and we hope to do that before the window shuts
4737339 summing it all up friends id say youll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true noble reputable authentic compelling gracious the best not the worst the beautiful not the ugly things to praise not things to curse put into practice what you learned from me what you heard and saw and realized do that and god who makes everything work together will work you into his most excellent harmonies

4737371 it didnt cross my mind that people wanted to talk to me today
4737372 i think its more important to be available when something goes wrong
4737373 since the trade happened ive had a lot of pent up emotions and anxiety thats how it is when you go to a new team
4737374 you try to fit in try to impress people sometimes maybe try to do too much thats what i didnt want to happen i tried to be as calm as i could tried to control my breathing tried to remember what i was doing in cleveland and not change anything just tried to be myself
4737375 kent knows how to hit thats the highest compliment i can pay
4737376 he knows the situation and is a patient hitter hes been huge for us
4737377 now if we fall behind early you know that if you stop the other team there weve got an offense that has produced a lot of runs lately
4737378 you can give up a couple runs and it doesnt mean we wont win
4737379 the way weve been putting runs on the board the past week theres no sense of panic on the bench if we get down a couple runs
4737380 some pitchers if they dont have good stuff or location they get frustrated
4737381 its not easy to face a guy who can hit the ball out of the park like him but joe beimel was a cool customer

4737398 we have to do it we have to put that winning formula together starting on saturday against southend
4737399 robinson is back after suspension other than that im pleased to say we have a clean bill of health and plenty to select from
4737400 away from home at those places you want to be in control of the game or at worst be 0 0 after 25 minutes local amp nations
4737401 i think swindon are a good team theyll be looking to better themselves from last year
4737402 a local derby obviously gives it a little bit of an edge
4737403 at our place were looking to continue the form of last year and im confident that we can take the game to people
4737404 thats the strangest thing for me its the closest game and supporters dont really class it as a derby local amp nations
4737405 do at least one good thing a day for someone else and you will feel good about yourself

4737413 we were sixth last season and the goal is to be better this time we were close to liverpool for a lot of time last season and now we have a stronger squad there is no reason to believe that we cant reach the top four
4737414 it is my belief and i hope that everyone else believes it as well we have a chance to do it
4737415 this is a challenge for me and i do like a challenge there is a great environment at the club and i like the way that we all pull together
4737416 i say to my friend capello terry is a good choice a very good choice
4737417 its all a matter of your choice if you truly want something want happiness you need to really grit your teeth and chase for it
4737418 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
4737419 for years before he bush came on the scene removing saddam hussein had been a priority embraced by the democratic administration of bill clinton and by clintons most vocal supporters in the senate
4737420 the unfolding catastrophe in iraq condemned the political judgment of a president
4737421 dozens of wmd related program activities and significant amounts of equipment
4737422 seriously underestimated the extent of saddams ties with terrorist groups of all sorts
4737423 al qaida in iraq has been driven out of its erstwhile strongholds in anbar baghdad and diyala provinces
4737424 whatever one wants to say about the conduct of the iraq war going to war to remove saddam hussein in 2003 was a necessary act
4737425 it should and could have been done earlier had not the clinton white house which understood the need not wasted the opportunity through timidity and bluster
4737426 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations

4737476 die menschen in sterreich haben die nase voll von dieser gro en koalition das ist die chance die wir nutzen wollen
4737477 wenn ich die wahl zwischen original und der kopie habe werde ich mich selbstverst ndlich f r das original entscheiden da werden sie mir wohl zustimmen j rg haider war in der langen entwicklung der fp der bestimmende faktor durch sein politisches handeln und wollen hat er diese partei getragen und an dem faktor hat sich nichts ge ndert
4737478 ich bin auch froh dass es seit haiders erscheinen im eurofighter untersuchungsausschu zu vermehrten gespr chen und letztendlich zu einer vers hnung gekommen ist ich bin froh dass j rg haider mir und an andere gesinnungsfreunde das angebot gemacht hat um eine breitere basis herzustellen ich hoffe dass es uns gelingen wird weitere freunde f r dieses projekt zu gewinnen wenn ich die politischen inhalte seit 1986 betrachte dann hat j rg haider in seiner politik immer recht behalten wie etwa in der eu politik ausl nderpolitik bei der globalisierung oder steuer und familienpolitik
4737479 es gibt jetzt die chance die politik von j rg haider fortzusetzen
4737480 wir sind beide 1986 angetreten um die gro e koalition zu berwinden und das politische system zu erneuern nach unserem ausscheiden hat sich vieles wieder in die falsche richtung entwickelt deshalb werden ewald stadler und ich nach dem erneuten scheitern der gro en koalition wieder f r eine erneuerung k mpfen ewald stadler wird als unabh ngiger volksanwalt f r das bz liste j rg haider kandidieren das ist eine einladung an alle mitzuarbeiten und ein zeichen f r die ffnung und verbreiterung der partei

4737491 usually one or two of the other party are chosen as a nod to non partisanship
4737492 you cant tell me that the very best people in the country except for one in 1999 were all democrats but then suddenly two years later all the best people in the country except for one were republicans
4737493 if the country is a third democratic a third republican and a third independent a democratic president who appoints only democrats has eliminated two thirds of the public from consideration
4737494 that rare combination of humility and confidence required to perform wisely at the highest level
4737495 the world has changed fundamentally and our system has not been able to adapt to these changes
4737496 the kind of reaching across the aisle that all of us believe is necessary
4737497 even if we have a landslide in the congressional elections we have to have a good 10 or 15 of the other party who are ready to join legislation or you are not going to get anything done
4737498 the worst thing anyone could do is not pay any attention to this low pressure system
4737499 you need to pay attention to what could potentially happen

4737509 when i started i never thought id make a good scout or hiker i never made eagle scoutings highest rank because i could not do a standing broad jump my family being depression poor we had no equipment no mess kits not much food slept in blankets pinned together and wore city shoes with leather soles with no grip
4737510 we gave him a big head start but wed always thought wed catch him
4737511 but we were huffing and puffing and when we got to where he was he was sunning himself with our sister crew from texas on his good days he was a speed demon
4737512 my knees were starting to fail i was mad at myself because i thought i might create an emergency
4737513 i knew so many people who when they turned 65 all they could talk about was sitting in a lounge chair and smoking a pipe
4737514 to me that was like preparing to die i hope to do this until the day i die
4737515 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding
4737516 were still working at it but we just dont have that much new
4737517 we have no record that he was ever any trouble on this campus
4737518 to me he was no different then when i went to the forestry school with him

4737542 and we are currently going through a second book of material from open hearts ministry weve heard one anothers stories and have journeyed alongside one another in our lives watching god take what felt devastating in the past and create places of beauty in our lives today
4737543 mack do you realize that your imagination of the future which is almost always dictated by fear of some kind rarely if ever pictures me there with you
4737544 because you dont believe you dont know that we love you the person who lives by their fears will not find freedom in my love i am not talking about rational fears regarding legitimate dangers but imagined fears and especially the projection of those into the future to the degree that those fears have a place in your life you neither believe i am good nor know deep in your heart that i love you you sing about it you talk about it but you dont know it
4737545 it is shocking that we live in a society where thieves are even prepared to steal from children parents are often more concerned with negotiating public transport and crowded supermarkets when out in public than keeping a watchful eye for criminals
4737546 parents with young children can ill afford additional expenditure to replace toys when faced with meeting the costs of nursery care nappies and clothing

4737549 blackburn have a new manager someone i played with when i was young
4737550 he ince left a big impression on me because he is such a winner and nothing stands in his way
4737551 he is probably the most determined player i have ever played with
4737552 out of all the current crop he is the one who i thought may just walk away from the game
4737553 but i look at the 1994 team at united and look at the strong characters who are now becoming managers it shows the strength of character that those players had
4737554 more weak economic news added to the gathering momentum of negative sentiment about the housing market
4737555 a further fall in house prices in may was not unexpected and for most of those not wishing to move house or borrow money secured on it the fall in value of their home is likely to be of limited concern in the short term
4737556 the national sales figures do not tell the whole story
4737557 indeed our recent survey of agents records some stability returning to the market in the number of sales agreed the number of viewings before a sale is secured and the average difference between asking and sales price
4737558 in the current climate its not surprising that more people are looking to fix their mortgage rate for longer
4737559 its more important than ever for borrowers to shop around for the best mortgage deal overall and not just settle for the cheapest headline rate
4737560 in the meantime customers wishing to receive a better deal from sky and virgin should look towards their bundled services where they will see discounts on home phone and broadband when they take up their tv service
4737561 will have quite a challenge on their hands convincing customers to part with their hard earned cash
4737562 i know that families up and down the country are feeling the impact in the cost of filling up at the petrol station and in the rise in gas and electricity bills
4737563 united states does not consider aweys a legitimate representative of the opposition movement the alliance for the re liberation of somalia
4737564 have to be very careful they dont find themselves overly reliant on credit which is unsustainable in the long run and can lead to people getting in real difficulty
4737565 regulation is only seven months away and firms need to make sure they are fully prepared
4737566 our rules are designed to put in place a proportionate risk based regulatory regime for these sales of travel insurance securing protection for customers

4737568 eco cars arent necessarily cheap to repair and every car has a grouping between one and 50
4737569 its just the case that smaller cars which therefore give out less pollution are automatically going to be cheaper to insure
4737570 todas as tropas russas e qualquer tropa paramilitar e irregular que tenha entrado com elas devem partir imediatamente
4737571 o mundo tem assistido com temor a r ssia invadindo um estado vizinho soberano e amea ando um governo democr tico eleito pelo povo
4737572 ela fujona e adora correr atr s da molecada do pr dio s vezes ela trope a principalmente quando est correndo e vai parar acho que porque n o tem muito apoio
4737573 as pessoas deviam olhar mais para esses animais porque eles tamb m merecem uma chance
4737574 eu fiquei com d e resolvi tentar cuidar dela tratei com homeopatia e contei com a ajuda de uma amiga que acupunturista
4737575 como ela tem incontin ncia urin ria precisa usar fralda todos os dias
4737576 mas ela se vira muito bem at entra em briga com os outros gatos e escala as gaiolas ela apronta mesmo
4737577 meu cunhado resgatou ela mas ningu m sabia que a gata era surda
4737578 descobriram que ela morava l porque ela miava muito alto justamente porque ela surda
4737579 meu sogro resgatou os gatos e levou para o consult rio quatro eram saud veis e eu consegui novos donos logo ficaram dolly e outra gata que era velha preta desdentada e gorda essa ningu m ia querer adotar mesmo e eu levei para a minha casa
4737580 achei que n o era justo mandar ela para outra fam lia
4737581 acho que as pessoas t m medo de enfrentar a situa o pensam nos gastos e que v o ter que ficar presas em casa
4737582 as pessoas s o mais dispostas a encarar a situa o cuidar de um bicho com limita es quando ela acontece com um animal que j faz parte da fam lia
4737583 de cara eu me assustei porque achava que n o ia conseguir cuidar dele que ia ter muita d
4737584 ele ainda estava com os pontos e a carinha toda raspada sem p lo sempre que ia pegar ele no colo para limpar ele ficava nervoso e eu percebi que era trauma de tanto levar inje o quando estava doente
4737585 ele corre no quintal brinca com os meus dois cachorros e j apareceu em casa com inseto e passarinho na boca
4737586 hoje as empresas p blicas t m praticamente um monop lio das grandes sele es nacionais acho que como controlador dessas empresas o governo exerce seu poder para manter isso e n o d as mesmas oportunidades para as privadas n o ilegal mas imoral na minha opini o
4737587 a bola da vez o marketing esportivo como estrat gia de sucesso
4737588 acontece devido a uma liga o mais estreita entre os presidentes de confedera es com pessoas ligadas ao governo
4737589 o retorno desse patroc nio alt ssimo especialmente em ano de olimp adas e o governo reserva tudo para si
4737590 1 somando se gin stica art stica e r timica 2 somando se nata o nado sincronizado e saltos ornamentais 3 somando se v lei de quadra e de praia
4737591 evidentemente isso tamb m bom para a imagem das empresas estatais
4737592 o esporte como instrumento de marketing positivo uma parceria onde ganham os clubes e as empresas n o vejo nada de mais que as empresas mesmo que p blicas queiram usar os esportes ol mpicos para se aproveitar disso
4737593 tem v rias empresas privadas que investem em times mas n o conseguem chegar s sele es o porqu disso para mim uma caixa preta o retorno de um selecionado maior sob todos os aspectos sobretudo em ano de olimp adas e empresas que poderiam ajudar muito mais o esporte e ter um retorno disso est o obrigadas a ficarem de fora desse neg cio
4737594 a televis o transmite em m dia por ano 33 mil horas de esporte no brasil um espa o enorme comparando sai muito mais barato exibir a marca atrav s do marketing esportivo do que comprar um hor rio correspondente na tv
4737595 os patrocinadores buscam no esporte uma forma de estabelecer rela o entre seus produtos e o esporte por exemplo uma empresa de energ ticos n o vai patrocinar um esporte calminho e sim um mais agitado isso gera uma identifica o com o p blico alvo da empresa
4737596 ent o patrocinar um esporte ol mpico algo que gera um retorno quase garantido
4737597 a lei de mercado tamb m vale para o patroc nio o espa o na m dia para esportes coletivos e mais conhecidos maior do que para esportes individuais com menos adeptos e se n o h um grau de exposi o adequado o patroc nio deixa de valer a pena

4737620 with donated land and labor provided by our volunteers we are able to build homes at a price our applicants can afford

4737630 as an attorney i have stood up to the big insurance companies and drug companies
4737631 we need to put a five month moratorium on foreclosures to give people time to work with lenders to make their loans affordable this will prevent the housing market from getting flooded which is driving down everyones home values lending regulations also need to be tightened to stop predatory lending practices
4737632 there are serious downsides to this approach though besides paying thousands more in interest buyers taking out long car loans are more likely to find themselves in a financial bind if they need a new car again in just a few years that could happen because of an accident or simply because a car owner is tempted by a newer model

4737652 he has a point to prove after what must have been a very frustrating year for him at chelsea
4737653 but he has channelled all that into training and his performances so far he is very versatile and is a good tackler
4737654 i felt we needed to be a bit more vocal at the back and tal has already shown that he likes everyone around him to know what he thinks they should be doing

4737677 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality

4737683 i have just completed the eleventh draft of noor jehan jehangir i just need three more drafts to finalise on the script

4737695 think of all the wall street firms where top executives pocketing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars based on what turned out to be non existent profits
4737696 well if we had real free market everything you want would come to pass
4737697 the only way to find out if ceos are over paid would be to reform corporate governance law and see what happens to salaries

4737707 poor russian president dmitry medvedev was one of the collateral victims of the war
4737708 who will say and when whether what began in south ossetia at the weekend is a passing crisis or on the contrary a gravely worrying prospect
4737709 it is perfectly normal that russia wants to defend its own interests and the interests of russians inside russia as well as russian speakers outside russia
4737710 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4737711 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4737712 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4737713 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4737714 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect

4737716 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4737717 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4737726 the league of women voters is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential debate scheduled for mid october because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the american voter
4737727 it has become clear to us that the candidates organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign trail charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions
4737728 the league has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the american public
4737729 neither barr nor nader are currently qualified to participate according to rules set out by the commission on presidential debates a private non profit corporation that has organized debates in the last several presidential election cycles the cpd requires that to be included in their debates candidates must appear on enough state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority of electoral college votes and must be winning at least 15 support in national public opinion polls before the debates

4737737 we zitten nu in een fase van ultieme politieke correctheid daar moeten wij als groenlinks genuanceerd mee omgaan en dat doet femke halsema op dit moment niet
4737738 het is alsof zij met terugwerkende kracht de bezettingen van het maagdenhuis dennendal of de strijd voor abortus afkeurt zulk soort acties waren destijds een belangrijke motor van de verandering halsema vliegt uit de bocht
4737739 binnen groenlinks zijn veel mensen die niet vinden dat je alle regels voetstoots moet aannemen het ligt niet zo simpel kraken was ook inbreken
4737740 ik weet nog dat inbreken misschien wel kon maar dat we het publiceren van namen fout vonden daarmee maakte je mensen tot doelwit er hoeft maar n gek te zijn die rare dingen gaat doen
4737741 maar gaat iemand van de telegraaf nu verantwoording afleggen voor het publiceren van het adres van duyvendak

4737754 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
4737755 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
4737756 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
4737757 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
4737758 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
4737759 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4737760 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
4737761 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
4737762 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there

4737780 with the slowed down economy with gas prices going through the roof that equals food prices and restaurant prices going up
4737781 look at the difference it can make economically to someone when you as a chef can help them have a great gathering of friends and family at their home that is affordable its wonderful
4737782 the most important thing chefs have to remember as teachers is to not make recipes that are too complicated or involve ingredients that are impossible to find
4737783 somehow i get the ladies the ladies kind of like me
4737784 it could be because im very passionate women love that
4737785 it is very important that you write your notes on the recipes in your cookbook
4737786 years from now your great great grandchildren will read your notes they are an imprint of your time on this earth
4737787 we put a good amount of thought into not making the recipes overkill and keeping them home cook friendly

4737792 i give professional tips and ideas about the way we do things
4737793 we omit some of the recipes that take three to four hours to make like the tomato marmalade on our caprese salad but we give them the recipe so if they want to take the time to do that they could
4737794 sometimes i wish i did get those kinds of questions

4737800 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4737801 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4737802 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4737803 god im hungry for you i need you i want to know you

4737816 kebanyakan tukang urut batin menggunakan kaedah urutan sama seperti anggota badan lain seperti urutan di badan kaki dan tangan kerana mereka tidak mengetahui teknik sebenar urutan pada bahagian berkenaan
4737817 mereka mudah terpedaya dan enggan mempelajari ilmu seks walaupun konsep urutan yang salah di sisi undang undang perubatan ini sudah kerap mendapat liputan akhbar
4737818 selain bayaran murah dan perkhidmatan mudah diperoleh mereka tidak percaya teknologi perubatan moden mampu memberi kesan lebih baik

4737830 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4737831 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4737832 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4737833 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4737834 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4737835 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4737836 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4737837 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log

4737839 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media
4737840 he was a man of integrity and honour a modern day knight
4737841 part of the problem is you have police officers who arent known around here coming in and making arrests harassing people and then leaving
4737842 its important to have a police presence here but they also need to understand the flavour of the neighbourhood and the benefits of dialogue and prevention
4737843 i would say that after 20 or more years of constant change there is a sort of reform fatigue in the montreal police service
4737844 you cant avoid creating widespread confusion if youre simultaneously practising two kinds of policing that are philosophically opposed and that erodes confidence in the police
4737845 and i think theres work to be done on all sides to shift distorted perceptions there are links that need to be repaired
4737846 its another stress to worry about instead of making music
4737847 a u k agent liked what he saw and wanted to put together a tour of them in the u k this fall
4737848 this would be a first time tour in a foreign land theyre not going to sell out huge halls its a building process so we rely on funding from these programs
4737849 its all the components that the artists and companies need to build the team to export internationally

4737853 the culture industry is no more entitled to receiving government aid than any other business or industry
4737854 im not saying that none of that money goes to good use
4737855 but a lot of that money goes to corporate welfare or projects of questionable value
4737856 that level of funding has a potential to support a large number of artists

4737861 police were called to the premises at 7 48pm on thursday august 14 where they found the body lying on the remains of a bonfire in the grounds
4737862 police believe the deceased may be a 40 year old male but have not been able to formally identify him as yet
4737863 police are treating the death as unexplained at present and are hoping that the results of the post mortem forensic tests and other available evidence will enable them to focus the inquiry in a positive direction
4737864 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4737865 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4737868 when i began investigating and documenting the history of prabhupadas books in 2003 it seemed more important than ever
4737869 the bbt was increasingly under fire from within iskcon for their editorial changes defending themselves from criticisms which had little or nothing to do with reality
4737870 it will also include resources such as handwritten corrections and references that prabhupada used such as sridhara swamis srimad bhagavatam commentaries and dr radhakrishnans gita
4737871 devotees working on srila prabhupadas books will be able to compare everything and understand how the editions we have now developed over the years
4737872 these are accompanied by infor mation on how to understand editorial changes who made them when they were made and how accurate or inaccurate they were
4737873 there were gorgeous orchards and gardens all around and the whole city was encircled by cannons so that no enemy could enter very easily
4737874 despite the recent attacks on the editors for making changes
4737875 its a fact that the bbts highest priority is always to bring the books closer to what prabhupada originally meant
4737876 and often without background history and information to help you understand what prabhupada wanted to say its hard to reflect the mood intended in a different language a translator shouldnt have to guess if he doesnt understand it that means the reader has no chance
4737877 prabhupadas works have such value for iskcon and the bbt and are already the topic of major heated discussions
4737878 those who remember how they were put together wont be here for much longer some like hayagriva have already left us
4737879 schools are already springing up all over iskcon to fulfill their educational needs
4737880 the cycle is beginning again and thats great but its important to make sure that we control the horse this time around rather than letting it gallop under a bridge and knock us off like last time
4737881 if our vision for quality education in iskcon is to become a reality teachers will have to be paid proper salaries
4737882 most devotee teachers would rather teach devotee kids exclusively and teach them about krishna but they cant do that and get the same salaries and benefits
4737883 their situation is unique since most of the residents of vrindavana are vaishnavas and are happy to wear tilak to work and teach krishna consciousness bgis can hire outside teachers
4737884 and with the dollar still worth a lot more than the rupee they can afford to pay them well too
4737885 we are amassing much of the excellent primary secondary and homeschooling information put together by iskcons best educators over the years
4737886 we can show you your options and help you navigate through the government labyrinth that stands in your way in many countries before you can take your childs education into your own hands
4737887 homeschooling is an excellent option because it allows you to give the necessary education within a krishna conscious framework
4737888 it also gives the parent the opportunity to become very in tune with the individual childs needs and craft a learning experience that they can thrive in
4737889 parents need to network with each other and create social environments were their children can interact with each other
4737890 parents can also rotate the homeschooling job teaching or providing after school engagement for several children as well as their own this allows the children to learn together and is a very viable possibility for stay at home moms or even mothers who work part time
4737891 in traditional indian families the parents and grandparents would spend a lot of time with the children teaching them moral values and philosophy through the mahabharata and ramayana
4737892 the more parents spend quality krishna conscious time with their children the more theyll excel no matter what their educational situation is
4737893 i love the new book but i wonder about milk touched by the lips of a serpent i refer of course to the non iskcon people represented in your book shouldnt we only hear from authorized representatives who embody the mood of lord chaitanya
4737894 why do i even want to know about these people outside of iskcon why should i care about what they have to say
4737895 when one is encouraged in devotional service by the association of devotees one becomes free from all unwanted contamination
4737896 those who merely appreciate the chanting of the holy name can be counted amongst the vaishnavas
4737897 all living beings are actually vaishnavas since all souls are ultimately servants of krishna
4737898 there are no hard and fast rules for chanting the holy name
4737899 one does not have to undergo initiation or execute the activities required before initiation one simply has to vibrate the holy name with his lips thus even a man in the lowest class candala can be delivered
4737900 a mantra not received through an authorized lineage will not bear fruit
4737901 its not like theyre chanting the maha mantra srila prabhupada
4737902 they are engaged in glorifying the names of god so it is alright do you want me to be sectarian
4737903 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4737904 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4737905 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4737906 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4737907 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4737908 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4737909 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4737910 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4737911 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4737912 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4737913 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4737914 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4737915 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4737916 jelas amalan meramal membaca dan menaruh sikit rasa yakin apa dikatakan ramalan bintang itu perlu dijauhi mulai hari ini ini bukan perkara main main atau seronok seronok kerana ia bercanggah dengan hukum islam
4737917 sesiapa yang datang kepada dukun kemudian dia membenarkan terhadap apa yang dikatakan olehnya maka solat orang itu tidak diterima allah selama 40 hari
4737918 jika tidak percaya atau untuk suka suka kenapa hingga melanggan sms horoskop maknanya bangun pagi kita mahu tengok apa yang diramalkan untuk kita hari itu begitu juga dengan membaca di akhbar dan majalah kenapa kita hendak tahu ramalan
4737919 jika katanya dalam bab rezeki apa yang diperoleh tidak setanding kerja dilakukan maka akan timbul perasaan malas buat kerja sebab rezeki yang dapat sikit saja kesan ramalan ini bukan saja pada akidah juga aspek psikologi
4737920 daripada suka suka itu juga apabila kebetulan perkara diramalkan itu benar berlaku ia mula menerbitkan kepercayaan yang akhirnya menyebabkan mereka jatuh ke lembah kepercayaan perkara karut marut ini
4737921 jika allah tidak izinkan perkara itu berlaku ia tidak akan jadi tukang ramal pusinglah daun terup atau biarlah burung dia bercakap tetapi tanpa izin allah tidak akan berlaku malangnya kita tengok zaman moden ramai yang kembali percaya dan mencari petunjuk daripada zodiak
4737922 contohnya bintang capricorn untuk mereka yang lahir 22 disember hingga 20 januari ikut mitos yunani ialah lambang kambing kambing itu bernama almateus dan pernah beri air pada dewa zeus iaitu dewa tertinggi bagi bangsa kuno ketika kecil
4737923 oleh itu bagi mengenang jasa kambing itu ia dijadikan bintang dan bercahaya di langit kesimpulannya capricorn itu kambing saja di sini pun banyak kambing tidak perlu tengok ke langit umat islam perlu renung sejenak adakah bintang ini sesuai dengan peribadi muslim
4737924 sesuai ke jika umat islam percaya kepada bintang kambing biri biri atau lambang orang lelaki gagah tuang air dalam tempayan besar sedangkan banyak perkara lain lebih bermanfaat yang boleh kita fikirkan
4737925 i love you i love you and i have no doubt about that im just afraid that
4737926 that everything your feeling right now is because we are not really together its an affair

4737928 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4737929 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4737930 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront

4737956 es immens el deute del nostre public ab carles salvador per haver donar a coneixer en valencia l excelent codificacio de la llengua elaborada cientificament per filolecs barcelonins de l escola de pompeu fabra
4737957 el dilema no era puix en valencia si fullanisme o fabrisme com en barcelona no era tampoc fabrisme o antifabrisme
4737958 que en valencia la cosa era senzillament o fabrisme o caos
4737959 si els escritors valencians tenim ara estem en l any 1967 l ortografia unificada i la morfologia prou establida ho devem principalment a carles salvador qui no sols fon un patriota insobornable i un excelent poeta sino tambe un pedagoc eficient i un gramatic sempre ben orientat
4737960 seria una injusticia oblidar les greus dificultats que el malaurat carles salvador hague de vencer ab paciencia la desorientacio l indisciplina i la perea colectiva els falsos prestigis i l apassionament dels contradictors etc etc
4737961 normes de castello de 1932 subterfugi o canal per a introduir les normes de l institut d estudis catalans en valencia en contra de la vera i autoctonai vernacula llengua valenciana a fi d impondre l imperi catala en llengua i cultura territori i demes
4737962 paralelament a la tasca de divulgacio en valencia de la doctrina gramatical fabrista que en tant d exit realisava carles salvador atres lleng istes no diu qui son havien mampres l estudi de la realitat idiomatica del pa s valenci tant en la llengua viva de les comarques en els pobles diriem nosatres com de la llengua dels nostres classics
4737963 quan encara era yo un jovenet el meu volgut colega josep giner de castello ab el seudonim de guillem renart i ferris public
4737964 en este seudonim de guillem renart ademes de numerosos articuls sobre temes gramaticals valencians del seu valenci s ha d entendre ha publicat un extens estudi de gramatica preceptiva com a introduccio al meritori
4737965 tambe vaig considerar que hi havia que mampendre com a base el fet viu i vivent valenci o siga el valenci tal com estava en eixe temps dels anys 30 40 i unificar lo idiomaticament ab catalunya i mallorca de forma coordinada mes que de forma subordinada
4737966 a l escriure yo la meua gramatica valenciana nosatres diriem valenciana de nom esta gramatica s edita en 1950 en mallorca pero ya la tenia acabada fea un grapat d anys mes no tenia diners
4737967 a l escriure yo la meua gramatica valenciana diu ell vaig pendre com a lema el consell del nostre mestre pompeu fabra i vaig procurar ajustar me a d ell concien udament
4737968 nosaltres els catalans no desitjariem altra cosa sin que emprengu ssiu una obra forta de depuracio del vostre idioma encara que no us preocup ssiu gens d acostar vos al nostre catala que tract ssiu de descastellanitzar el valenci i enriquint lo procurar acostar lo al valenci dels vostres grans escriptors medievals

4737970 sabem coneguem que hi ha prou catalans i no sols dins del principat que planyen que se llamenten per les concessions a la morfologia regional que hem fet els gramatics valencians i mallorquins ya que venen a significar una duplicitat de formes en la llengua lliteraria
4737971 pero podriem objectarlos proseguix guarner a eixos catalans que mai ha segut unitaria la comunitat historico cultural que formen els paisos catalans en l orde intelectual ni en el politic perque la corona d arago fon diu ell una confederacio d estats lliures en uns monarques itinerants es dir sense una capital federal fixa i si entenem per capitalitat lliteraria el lloc a on l idioma ha gojat de mes llustre i vigor hi ha que proclamar si be des de la renaixen a ho es barcelona el cap i casal espiritual i material de la nostra comunitat cultural fou la ciutat de valencia la verdadera capital de les lletres catalanes en el sigle xv es a dir en el seu periode aureu en eixe temps fou tambe la capital financiera de la corona d arago

4737974 en la situacio actual les normes de castello han perdut en gran part la seua vigencia de fe per a convertir se o fer se una mostra eixemplar de l intent dignificador de la propia llengua
4737975 en la situacio tan delicada a o ya fa 13 anys 1982 per la que atravessa la cultura dels valencians hem de deixar a part l estil d una commemoracio academicista i convertir la en una manifestacio d amples resonancies civiques i reivindicatives en favor del catala com a instrument definidor de la nostra personalitat nacional

4737986 les normes de castello foren l enaltiment d una llengua que en l epoca de llorente tots li dien
4737987 encara queda encara hi ha gent que creu que les normes de castello del 1932 foren una meta final un lloc al que haviem d arribar tots els que escriuen quan en realitat les normes de castello son una cita una parada en el cami son un punt o lloc d unio a fi d escomen ar a caminar tots junts treballant dia a dia per a millorar la nostra llengua aixi ho va entendre carles salvador i aixi anaven avan ant els cursos de lo rat penat dirigits pel mateix carles salvador

4738091 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
4738092 it seems extraordinary to imagine that four us agents whod gone to pick her up two military two fbi along with at least two afghan translators were somehow surprised by this woman who overpowered them grabbed a gun flipped the safety fired off a couple of shots and then could only be subdued by shots to the torso
4738093 if the story suggested by the us government is accurate it paints a very unflattering picture of the competence of forces who are literally on the frontlines of the war on terror
4738094 if the us story is not true then were looking at a serious breach of us and international law when a prisoner in custody is shot
4738095 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
4738096 we have captured 689 members of al qaeda and handed over 369 to the united states we have earned bounties totalling millions of dollars those who habitually accuse us of not doing enough in the war on terror should simply ask cia how much prize money it has paid to the government of pakistan
4738097 the policy followed by pakistan on the extradition of foreigners has been first to ask their countries of origin to take them back if a country of origin refuses as is normally the case we hand the prisoner over to the united states

4738121 biscardi is a las vegas promoter and a showman and hes doing it again
4738122 we always say this is the end of biscardi hes never coming back i mean the man has nine lives
4738123 is to attract lots of attention to himself to hold the attention of the mass media while he arranges various deals for documentaries books etc

4738125 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4738126 we believe 99 percent of the bigfoot world is lunatics
4738127 thats what our videos are about we just wanted to turn things around and make fun of the bigfoot world and how crazy they are
4738128 are just huge frauds and the thing about it is when we come out with the bigfoot and evidence of a true bigfoot all the fraud things theyve been saying and what they put out there as gospel is no longer true
4738129 there is no reason that exactly the opposite kind of people that everyone wished would find bigfoot have tripped across one in the woods
4738130 its not a mythological creature that theres just one of
4738131 its a species that may be really rare but theyre actually out there breeding
4738132 we have located a family of bigfoot and besides the clear photos and video we have something even more shocking a body
4738133 that has nothing to do with the business of the clayton county police department as long as hes not engaged in any type of illegal activity his business is his business
4738134 maybe whitton did obtain the hard evidence required to solve one of the worlds greatest mysteries
4738135 it is apparently being promoted by a police officer that has everything to lose as far as his profession is concerned if it is a game a hoax or just a joke on the other hand if it is true and the bigfoot body is in his custody his decision to announce it on an internet web site before the body was examined by an expert certainly indicates a lack of good judgment
4738136 live and let live what happened to that guys just trying to have a little fun you know
4738137 why would we jeopardize matts job why would we risk the embarrassment of the backlash that we would get we just have a lot to lose if this is a hoax i thought bigfoot trackers and hunters were ridiculous and i made fun of them to be honest and i still do they know nothing as fact we do

4738158 we gave a brief run down of what happened at each spot and relatives of those killed spoke about what it meant to the families to have lost a family member

4738160 this is another stage in our campaign for a public apology and international investigation into the killings

4738166 the intention is not to change the composition of the board
4738167 reinforce among the public a perception that the universitys faculty lacks intellectual and ideological diversity
4738168 it is a right wing think tank being put in place
4738169 the long term consequences will be very severe this will be a flagship entity and it will attract a lot of money and a lot of attention and i think work at the university and the universitys reputation will take a serious rightward turn to the detriment of all
4738170 the credit crunch about which we hear so much but inflation
4738171 the conventional wisdom is that the period of exuberance during the boom period
4738172 it carries connotations of something fragile which was never quite real in the first place

4738211 terry is a proper captain he is a man that when you say something to him he will help you achieve it
4738212 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4738213 he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is

4738232 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4738236 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4738251 more than one in five christian kids admit they use or have used drugs alcohol in a nationwide survey 17 of pastors with kids ages 10 to 30 revealed their children either currently abuse drugs or alcohol or have abused them in the past 74 of those pastoral families do not seek professional assistance when they discover the problem in their family
4738252 58 of clergy acknowledge that they avoid addressing alcoholism among the individuals and families they counsel when asked how many had tried marijuana 47 percent of the unchurched young people had done so compared with 38 percent of the churched youth
4738253 by the 12th grade 49 percent of us youth have used marijuana research has long shown that the abuse of illicit drugs is the single most serious health problem in the united states thirteen year olds are three times more likely to know how to obtain marijuana or to know someone who abuses drugs than are 12 year olds
4738254 only 1 4 of individuals who abuse illicit drugs seek treatment recent studies have shown that after 6 months treatment for alcoholism is successful for 40 to 70 percent of patients

4738256 specialists who inspected those objects found no usable fingerprints on them
4738257 in essence there is no proof of who that stuff belonged to
4738258 could you please tell me what conclusion i should draw from this
4738259 it was declared that huge quantities of weapons and ammunition were handed out to protesters but forensic tests showed that the quantities were not huge
4738260 and even assuming that they were handed out they can not serve as evidence
4738261 this seems to prove the theory that the police actions had elements of disproportionateness
4738262 this is my subjective view as far as supporting evidence is concerned the situation is quite sad
4738263 so eine interessante trainerkonstellation hat es wirklich schon lange nicht mehr gegeben wenn das eine mannschaft w re k nnte man sagen die mischung zwischen jung und alt stimmt

4738269 das wird ein interessantes spiel zum auftakt bruno labbadia ist als trainer eine bereicherung f r die bundesliga
4738270 ihn kann keiner ersetzen die rolle von diego kann nur diego spielen
4738271 wenn wir gegen bielefeld unsere chancen nutzen dann wird es keinen einfluss haben ob diego da ist oder nicht

4738282 we have come to australia a little ahead of the series we will play five practice matches before the odis and that will give us a good idea about the conditions here
4738283 the last time we were here in 2003 the pitches did not have too much pace or bounce
4738284 and the weather here is almost similar to bangladesh i think well feel comfortable here
4738285 i am sure they australia remember the loss to bangladesh in 2005 and they will come hard at us
4738286 we are an improving side and the objective remains the same here also we have shown in the past that if we get to scores in the region of 250 then we can put pressure on the opposition

4738330 dois homens e um destino 1969 fazendo dupla com robert redford
4738331 sam was born north of the tyne during my four years playing at st jamess park
4738332 so hes officially a geordie even though we moved to manchester when he was only a baby he has always supported newcastle hell be with me at barnsley tomorrow and in among the toon army at old trafford on sunday
4738333 his jaw dropped when he heard the news it was his dream tie so obviously hes delighted he is due to be on holiday with his pals in greece but hell be coming back for the game
4738334 i think its the plum tie of the round newcastle are one of the biggest clubs in the country and their first trip to the ricoh should make it a fantastic evening
4738335 there are lots of links between the two clubs i was at newcastle during kevin keegans first spell as manager chris coleman was his captain at fulham and last but by no means least our vice chairman gary hoffman takes over as chief executive of northern rock a couple of days after the game
4738336 the additional revenues are a tremendous boost but more than that its a great occasion for everybody concerned me chris the players and the supporters
4738337 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris
4738338 these demonstrations should open the eyes of indians every soul wants freedom
4738339 authorities have said no force should be used against peaceful demonstrations
4738340 he is our hero he has laid a fresh foundation for our freedom struggle with his martyrdom
4738341 the garage had the money in its account earning interest while i was forced to pay for insurance and make finance instalments
4738342 the law does not set out anything unless youve agreed a delivery date however it does say you must get your goods within a reasonable time we would say six weeks is unreasonable the consumer should argue that he should not have to pay for something he hasnt used so asking for one months finance payment back would be fair
4738343 there was a communication breakdown between mr mcclaren and our workshop
4738344 i have now spoken to him and his car has been booked in to be repaired i will then sit down with him and discuss what would make him happy following all this inconvenience
4738345 im happy that things are progressing i think six weeks insurance and finance payments would be adequate compensation
4738346 remington and its top producers have developed a stellar reputation for successfully delivering financing to complex transactions
4738347 bluestones goal is to leverage our past record of success and experience serving the institutional borrower while focusing solely on their demanding and complex needs
4738348 punitive old fashioned and creating a negative impression of libraries
4738349 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second
4738350 it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4738351 what you did tonight was epic i never thought for one moment that you were out of the race
4738352 he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4738353 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud itll be exciting back home
4738354 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face

4738360 rane should handle the situation patiently otherwise he is not going to get anything
4738361 rane has a different political course otherwise we would have come together much earlier
4738362 every weekend it seems theyre hauling one off for one reason or another
4738363 they may not all have to be euthanized but theyre definitely career ending injuries attributable to a surface thats too hard too unlevel or punching through the base owners have told me never again they wont come back
4738364 i keep my fingers crossed every time i run youve got enough to worry about without having to worry about whether theyre going to break down in a damn race my owners put a lot of money and time into this and its becoming a judgment call do we want to run on this
4738365 we have 250 to 300 owners and trainers working in this backstretch and not one of them has mentioned their concern to our racetrack manager
4738366 and now that theres a big article in the paper and theyre complaining about it its remarkable to us
4738367 the horsemen are not the ones on the track the jockeys are the ones on the track this is their livelihood they put their lives on the line every time they go out on that track if its not safe they will not do it and they tell us the track is in good shape
4738368 i attribute the complaints to people who are losing theyre losing at the track they get frustrated and like to blame it on somebody else
4738369 i took my car out there and ive never been on a smoother road
4738370 there was not a bump on that track not a bump
4738371 i say to my friend capello terry is a good choice a very good choice
4738372 terry is a proper captain he is a man that when you say something to him he will help you achieve it
4738373 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4738374 he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4738375 quantity has been low but the quality is very very high
4738376 we have just broken our record for a defender and that sends out a message
4738377 spurs have brought in more players but there is still two weeks to go and it does not mean to say we cannot catch them up or compete with them this season
4738378 i dont think fabricio will be the last to come in by a long way
4738379 i do not think we have ever been closer than we are now
4738380 we are very much united and i am sure if you ask dennis wise tony jiminez jeff vetere mike ashley and derek llambias they would say the same thing because it is the truth
4738381 we all understand each others briefs and what each of us brings to the club
4738382 when you have six or seven guys in a room talking football you are never going to agree on everything but the important thing is that when we dont agree it stays in the room
4738383 mike has come out and said how he sees the club and i welcome that because it stops the uncertainty which was destabilising for fans
4738384 mike is really committed to this club he would be the first to tell you he does not understand everything about football but i guarantee that what he doesnt know he will learn very quickly
4738385 i felt a bit of pressure out there today saturday but im just glad to get the win and i cant wait to get back in the ring
4738386 its going to be a tough fight but im ready for him
4738387 i did everything i could out there and i thought it was closer but im not saying he didnt win
4738388 the cubans a very good experienced fighter and hell probably go on to win the gold medal
4738389 this has all been a great experience for me one year ago i wasnt even thinking of reaching the beijing olympics
4738390 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4738391 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4738392 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4738393 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4738394 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4738395 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4738396 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4738397 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4738398 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4738399 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4738400 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4738401 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4738402 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4738403 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4738404 nous avons t enchant s par les succ s de l v nement 2006
4738405 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4738406 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4738407 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4738408 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4738409 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4738410 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4738411 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4738412 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4738413 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4738414 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4738415 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4738416 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4738417 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4738418 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4738419 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving

4738455 the other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intention
4738456 i had been learning to drive with power steering i turned the wheel to what i thought was enough and found myself in a different direction going the opposite way
4738457 coming home i drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree i dont have
4738458 i thought my window was down but found it was up when i put my hand through it
4738459 no one was to blame for the accident but it never would have happened if the other driver had been alert
4738460 the pedestrian had no idea which direction to go so i ran over him
4738461 i saw the slow moving sad faced old gentleman as he bounced off the hood of my car
4738462 i had been driving for 40 years when i fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident
4738463 i was taking my canary to the hospital it got loose in the car and flew out the window the next thing i saw was his rear end and there was a crash
4738464 i was backing my car out of the driveway in the usual manner when it was struck by the other car in the same place where it had been struck several times before
4738465 the indirect cause of this accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth
4738466 the accident happened when the right door of a car came around the corner without giving a signal
4738467 i was thrown from my car as it left the road i was later found in a ditch by some stray cows
4738468 i had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home as i reached an intersection a hedge sprung up obscuring my vision
4738469 i was on the way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal joint gave way causing me to have an accident
4738470 i was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the road when i struck him
4738471 i told the police that i was not injured but on removing my hat i found that i had a fractured skull
4738472 my wench slipped losing my balance and i hurt my back
4738473 i was unable to stop in time and my car crashed into the other vehicle the driver and passengers then left immediately for a vacation with injuries
4738474 to avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front i struck the pedestrian
4738475 the accident occurred when i was attempting to bring my car out of a skid by steering it into the other vehicle
4738476 when i could not avoid a collision i stepped on the gas and crashed into the other car
4738477 i collided with a stationary truck coming the other way
4738478 in my attempt to kill a fly i drove into a telephone pole
4738479 my car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle
4738480 as i approached the intersection a stop sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign had ever appeared before i was unable to stop in time to avoid the accident
4738481 the telephone pole was approaching fast i was attempting to swerve out of its path when it struck my front end
4738482 a truck backed though my windshield and into my wifes face
4738483 i pulled away from the side of the road glanced at my mother in law and headed over the embankment
4738484 the guy was all over the road i had to swerve a number of times before i hit him
4738485 an invisible car came out of nowhere struck my vehicle and vanished

4738490 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is okay because we were able to protect them
4738491 when i trained him to listen i trained him to listen for stories
4738492 when you go out and interview someone you try to build a relationship with them their story indicates how they feel about their life its a narrative and you listen for that
4738493 if what we wanted was change to eliminate multi generation poverty and the impact of discrimination we were not able to do that
4738494 but no one else has been able to do that
4738495 he knew a lot about king he knew a lot about the civil rights movement he was half black looked black to the world he identified with him and that was the source of his idealism
4738496 he wanted to find his own way to continue kings work
4738497 i didnt know a soul in chicago and i wasnt sure what this community organizing business was all about
4738498 i had always been inspired by stories of the civil rights movement and jfks call to service but when i got to the south side there were no marches and no soaring speeches in the shadow of an empty steel plant there were just a lot of folks who were struggling
4738499 i still remember one of the very first meetings we put together to discuss gang violence with a group of community leaders
4738500 we waited and waited for people to show up and finally a group of older people walked into the hall
4738501 all those years watching him as a larger than life figure and seeing the impact he had on the confidence of the african american community the hopefulness of the community had a lasting effect on me
4738502 he said he wanted to do community work and i said well thats great barack
4738503 he said sit down before i tell you the rest of this im taking michelle with me i said you no good rotten so and so
4738504 he was an extraordinarily bright young man who didnt know what he was going to do

4738619 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
4738620 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
4738621 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
4738622 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
4738623 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
4738624 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4738625 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
4738626 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
4738627 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there

4738633 hey lets go out for a new england frozen lemonade
4738634 i blaze my own trail through this landscape of garish facades
4738635 and you might be quite varied in your interests but keep in mind that you picked each of them up somewhere and you probably share them with someone you know
4738636 this is what we play this is what well always play and fuck you too
4738637 glorified ad rag with a leftist front a nasty organization with a great emphasis on squeezing people and intimidating advertisers

4738640 were country fans in general and weve been waiting for this all week weve got perfect seats
4738641 we came out for the entertainment food and the beautiful night and i look forward to the singing i printed out a picture of him and if i can catch him afterwards id like to get his autograph
4738642 if its ok with you im going to play some songs from my first album and some from the new album everyone having a good time so far
4738643 this hits not only those plants and workers but all the businesses and suppliers who may have been dependent on those workers and this is all working its way through the system
4738644 and other manufacturing is way down too this tracks with what we are seeing especially among blue collar jobs
4738645 total employment decreased in both goods producing and service producing industries
4738646 the competition is where we take our top showmen from each of the six large animal species it is the greatest honor for a kid to be able to compete in this and win the overall basically they are going to show each of the six species and well make our pick of the best showmen of the entire group
4738647 we have watched her grow up this was her first year to show dairy cows and then she won showmanship usually she shows hogs and horses
4738648 he watched to see my movements that i did everything right when he touches my pig he wants to see that i got my brush out and brushed it off i had to keep the pig between myself and him and if he tries to trick me and go around the pig i have to get to the other side the horse was definitely the most foreign to me ive never worked with horses before this week ive shown a sheep and goat but obviously the hogs are what i excelled in ive shown open class beef but ive never shown dairy at least ive been around them but ive never been around horses before so i think im doing pretty well so far i just had to get the horse out of the way
4738649 you have to win your age division with your own animal and then through the sweepstakes and you are entered in this and you go around and show the different animals
4738650 the only thing i havent shown is a steer and a goat so im looking forward to that
4738651 we felt that theres more sentiment in the community to save the auditorium and theres definitely a lot of fine arts groups and theatre groups that could benefit from it with the building of the new high school there will be two new gyms in it and the main court will be nearly as big and have nearly the seating capacity as the old gym we knew wed be asking too much of the public to try to save both of them the price tag was just too high
4738652 and there was no real significant difference except this one i think by renovating the old high school wed end up with twice as much space as wed get for virtually the same amount of money just to put in actual seating and a stage area for a new one
4738653 the cost to renovate was established at 5 7 million but because we have to borrow to get the project done in order to borrow we can only borrow against 50 percent of proceeds so we have to generate double that to borrow
4738654 the board will get started on the process to fill that vacancy right away hell be missed hes certainly a very objective and experienced board member
4738655 ive got some stuff going on in my personal and professional life thats not going to allow me to devote the time it takes to do the job that i like to do for that
4738656 but thats for them to decide i think well have some good candidates
4738657 he hasnt as of yet friday afternoon but the timeline isnt over until monday midnight
4738658 this is the clearest its been all year were doing pretty good
4738659 we havent seen the sampling of these lakes for over a decade
4738660 its been almost two decades of not sampling this dillon lake
4738661 in 1990 this lake was going through what we call eutrophication meaning it had a lot of nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen from fertilizers and agriculture run off
4738662 that kind of nutrient input causes increased algae and a lot of it will start to negatively impact fish because of the decrease in oxygen
4738663 weve been really good at sampling streams but weve ignored the lakes
4738664 dillon is a part of a large watershed initiative to sample the streams in the watershed it catches all the streams allowing us to see the overall quality of the watershed
4738665 this was my first year i didnt know what to expect so i just went with the flow
4738666 it was hard raising a hog but it was a good experience
4738667 i got attached to it but i plan to continue doing this i hope this one goes for at least 3 or 4 a pound
4738668 im on the livestock committee and i always try to attend all the sales
4738669 i enjoy seeing the variety of hogs in this one
4738670 this has been a great experience for them year after year they look forward to it every year and my one son has five years under his belt
4738671 the average is 2 50 a pound which is exceptionally good considering the market
4738672 the significant amount of physical and circumstantial evidence that have been uncovered reveal that this was no accident

4738675 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
4738676 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
4738677 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
4738678 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
4738679 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler
4738680 hab a recibido varios cad veres que pertenec an supuestamente a hitler
4738681 en julio de 1986 salimos por primera vez del estudio para hacer el tiempo

4738689 quantity has been low but the quality is very very high
4738690 we have just broken our record for a defender and that sends out a message
4738691 spurs have brought in more players but there is still two weeks to go and it does not mean to say we cannot catch them up or compete with them this season
4738692 i dont think fabricio will be the last to come in by a long way
4738693 i do not think we have ever been closer than we are now
4738694 we are very much united and i am sure if you ask dennis wise tony jiminez jeff vetere mike ashley and derek llambias they would say the same thing because it is the truth
4738695 we all understand each others briefs and what each of us brings to the club
4738696 when you have six or seven guys in a room talking football you are never going to agree on everything but the important thing is that when we dont agree it stays in the room
4738697 mike has come out and said how he sees the club and i welcome that because it stops the uncertainty which was destabilising for fans
4738698 mike is really committed to this club he would be the first to tell you he does not understand everything about football but i guarantee that what he doesnt know he will learn very quickly
4738699 i say to my friend capello terry is a good choice a very good choice
4738700 terry is a proper captain he is a man that when you say something to him he will help you achieve it
4738701 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4738702 he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4738703 i felt a bit of pressure out there today saturday but im just glad to get the win and i cant wait to get back in the ring
4738704 its going to be a tough fight but im ready for him
4738705 i did everything i could out there and i thought it was closer but im not saying he didnt win
4738706 the cubans a very good experienced fighter and hell probably go on to win the gold medal
4738707 this has all been a great experience for me one year ago i wasnt even thinking of reaching the beijing olympics
4738708 it is a great new way for people to get fit and stay motivated

4738718 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4738719 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4738720 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4738721 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4738722 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4738723 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4738724 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4738725 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4738726 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4738727 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change

4738735 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4738736 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4738737 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4738738 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4738739 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4738740 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4738741 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4738742 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4738743 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4738744 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4738745 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4738746 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4738747 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4738748 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4738749 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4738750 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4738751 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4738752 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4738753 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4738754 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4738755 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4738756 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4738757 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4738758 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4738759 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4738760 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4738761 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

4738766 russia had to move in if only to save face
4738767 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
4738768 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor
4738769 you can measure the demise of the empire by the rate at which its satraps are falling and wringing their hands
4738770 peter has a sound financial goal but his mortgage will not finish until three years after he reaches state pension age
4738771 a good first step would be to review his household expenditure and see how much extra he can put towards paying off the mortgages early
4738772 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4738773 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops

4738797 complained that exxon mobil corp makes too much money and should be forced to give some of that profit to the government
4738798 the other day we learned that exxon mobil made nearly 12 billion last quarter to put it another way they made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank of gas

4738857 its just fantastic to see that they stood up for their rights and had something to say on the matter
4738858 i think its about turning those draws into wins and narrow losses into draws
4738859 you know times that we slipped up last year we can do much better so thats certainly a focus for us
4738860 otherwise were doing the same thing the king and the knights have done previously you know
4738861 its looked good to start with but then we havent produced the goods so we need to produce the goods on the field
4738862 it doesnt matter who were playing were out there to win
4738863 home games are very important for everyone but particularly coming across the ditch teams dont like to come here and if we can get a good group of supporters behind us tomorrow itll add to the atmosphere and make it even harder for teams to come across here

4738865 speak ing out long repeatedly with lots of detail and literally eloquence
4738866 this has been accepted without changes and signed by the russian side and has also been signed by representatives of the georgian sides
4738867 they are taking up defensive positions 2km north of kaspi junction and there is word of talks between georgian and russian troops
4738868 it appears the russians are not going anywhere at least not until they are ready this comes despite the ceasefire agreement which requires russian withdrawal to pre conflict positions
4738869 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4738870 this therefore can only be yet another completely unverified statement we are not conducting bombardments i can say with full responsibility that this cannot be the case
4738871 the original six point plan had a different sixth point it only said that the status of abhazia and south ossetia would be up for negotiation in talks by the international community
4738872 what the russians did on tuesday was add an extra dimesnion to that they said that they want to have international peacekeepers in the two breakaway regions russian peacekeepers as well as the removal of georgian forces from both zones
4738873 quite clearly what saakashvili has agreed to is a reduction in any influence on the georgian side in these two areas
4738874 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris
4738875 these demonstrations should open the eyes of indians every soul wants freedom

4738886 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4738887 we think its going to make good sense in the long run
4738888 we kind of predicted there would be some plateauing of it

4738899 n o existe minimalismo neste momento da moda o mercado come a a absorver esta tend ncia que deve permanecer pelo menos at o pr ximo ver o toda mulher deve ter um colar de impacto em seu guarda roupa

4738901 eles d o uma sofistica o parte mas preciso saber usar acho mais adequado usar com um brinquinho pequeno
4738902 ela fujona e adora correr atr s da molecada do pr dio s vezes ela trope a principalmente quando est correndo e vai parar acho que porque n o tem muito apoio
4738903 as pessoas deviam olhar mais para esses animais porque eles tamb m merecem uma chance
4738904 eu fiquei com d e resolvi tentar cuidar dela tratei com homeopatia e contei com a ajuda de uma amiga que acupunturista
4738905 como ela tem incontin ncia urin ria precisa usar fralda todos os dias
4738906 mas ela se vira muito bem at entra em briga com os outros gatos e escala as gaiolas ela apronta mesmo
4738907 meu cunhado resgatou ela mas ningu m sabia que a gata era surda
4738908 descobriram que ela morava l porque ela miava muito alto justamente porque ela surda
4738909 meu sogro resgatou os gatos e levou para o consult rio quatro eram saud veis e eu consegui novos donos logo ficaram dolly e outra gata que era velha preta desdentada e gorda essa ningu m ia querer adotar mesmo e eu levei para a minha casa
4738910 achei que n o era justo mandar ela para outra fam lia
4738911 acho que as pessoas t m medo de enfrentar a situa o pensam nos gastos e que v o ter que ficar presas em casa
4738912 as pessoas s o mais dispostas a encarar a situa o cuidar de um bicho com limita es quando ela acontece com um animal que j faz parte da fam lia
4738913 de cara eu me assustei porque achava que n o ia conseguir cuidar dele que ia ter muita d
4738914 ele ainda estava com os pontos e a carinha toda raspada sem p lo sempre que ia pegar ele no colo para limpar ele ficava nervoso e eu percebi que era trauma de tanto levar inje o quando estava doente
4738915 ele corre no quintal brinca com os meus dois cachorros e j apareceu em casa com inseto e passarinho na boca
4738916 hoje as empresas p blicas t m praticamente um monop lio das grandes sele es nacionais acho que como controlador dessas empresas o governo exerce seu poder para manter isso e n o d as mesmas oportunidades para as privadas n o ilegal mas imoral na minha opini o
4738917 a bola da vez o marketing esportivo como estrat gia de sucesso
4738918 acontece devido a uma liga o mais estreita entre os presidentes de confedera es com pessoas ligadas ao governo
4738919 o retorno desse patroc nio alt ssimo especialmente em ano de olimp adas e o governo reserva tudo para si
4738920 1 somando se gin stica art stica e r timica 2 somando se nata o nado sincronizado e saltos ornamentais 3 somando se v lei de quadra e de praia
4738921 evidentemente isso tamb m bom para a imagem das empresas estatais
4738922 o esporte como instrumento de marketing positivo uma parceria onde ganham os clubes e as empresas n o vejo nada de mais que as empresas mesmo que p blicas queiram usar os esportes ol mpicos para se aproveitar disso
4738923 tem v rias empresas privadas que investem em times mas n o conseguem chegar s sele es o porqu disso para mim uma caixa preta o retorno de um selecionado maior sob todos os aspectos sobretudo em ano de olimp adas e empresas que poderiam ajudar muito mais o esporte e ter um retorno disso est o obrigadas a ficarem de fora desse neg cio
4738924 a televis o transmite em m dia por ano 33 mil horas de esporte no brasil um espa o enorme comparando sai muito mais barato exibir a marca atrav s do marketing esportivo do que comprar um hor rio correspondente na tv
4738925 os patrocinadores buscam no esporte uma forma de estabelecer rela o entre seus produtos e o esporte por exemplo uma empresa de energ ticos n o vai patrocinar um esporte calminho e sim um mais agitado isso gera uma identifica o com o p blico alvo da empresa
4738926 ent o patrocinar um esporte ol mpico algo que gera um retorno quase garantido
4738927 a lei de mercado tamb m vale para o patroc nio o espa o na m dia para esportes coletivos e mais conhecidos maior do que para esportes individuais com menos adeptos e se n o h um grau de exposi o adequado o patroc nio deixa de valer a pena

4738952 therefore since god was just and evil deeds were punished
4738953 what is necessary to the perfection of the universe is not our sins or our unhappiness but the existence of souls that simply because they are souls sin if they so will and become unhappy if they sin
4738954 that adams sin injured only adam himself and not the human race and that infants at their birth are in the same state that adam was in before his transgression
4738955 a treatise on the grace of christ and on original sin
4738956 so if it was not our natures that force us to sin what was it augustine maintained that it was the penalty of the original sin the sin of adam and eve not a change in the nature of humans
4738957 t o struggle against the pain of carnal bondage and not be able to refrain from acts of inordinate desire these do not belong to the nature that human beings were created with they are the penalty of the condemned prisoner
4738958 augustine asked if human foreknowledge of an action determined it
4738959 if esau was rejected for no fault of his own because he too was not born and had done nothing when it was said the elder shall serve the younger how can his rejection be said to be just
4738960 all humans are sinful as a consequent all humans deserve the hatred of god
4738961 augustine solved this conundrum by appealing to a divergence in the words
4738962 when god called someone he enabled the will to choose god or to reject god
4738963 god does what he will in the hearts of humans either by assistance or judgment so that even through their means may be fulfilled what his hand and counsel have predestined to be done
4738964 he says that it was not until he wrote his letter to simplician that he was
4738965 led augustine to solidify his theological quivering so while his arguments were most definitely shaped against those he was combating at the time when one looks at them as a whole there were only slight variances that solidified in his later years

4739018 the united states is inching closer toward ratifying the united nations convention on the law of the sea treaty lost
4739019 the law of the sea treaty lost entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 153 countries for a list of recent lost developments the treaty gives the un complete jurisdiction over the oceans and everything in them including the ocean floor with all its resources along with the power to regulate 70 percent of the worlds surface the international seabed authority could require the united states to share intelligence technology and even military information lost could impose restrictions on intelligence gathering by u s submarines activities that are essential to national defense

4739059 a fost o cursa echilibrata iar echipele belarusului si chinei au fost intr adevar puternice am fost cu ochii pe ele toata cursa ne asteptam ca belarus sa fie principalul nostru competitor insa china chiar ne a surprins pe toti psihologic este o victorie foarte buna pentru canotajul romanesc acum cu o zi inainte de finala de 8 1
4739060 mi a fost putin teama de aceasta finala tinand cont ca am avut probleme la mana dreapta inainte de a ajunge la beijing dar dupa primii 500 de metri am stiut ca este cursa noastra am avut un start foarte bun si ne asteptam sa se termine asa personal credeam ca germania o sa evolueze mai bine speram ca maine sa luam al doilea aur la canotaj pentru romania
4739061 tot ce pot sa va spun este ca la ceremonia de premiere a fost superb ca intotdeauna am avut o cursa grea dar cand primesti medalia de aur uiti de toate eforturile fizice si de toate sacrificiile am incredere ca si maine vom fi victorioase la proba de 8 1 pentru ca am muncit tot anul pentru asta
4739062 we recovered about 30 percent of what we lost but we still have a ways
4739063 the releases were frequently in the neighborhood of half of what they would normally be it looks better at least for this year
4739064 its a combination of the normal mountain snowpack some good rain this spring up in the dakotas and montana and the fact that we had extraordinarily low releases from gavins point throughout the spring and into the early summer
4739065 we are now releasing 22 500 cfs out of gavins and have been that way for a week and it will remain that way for another two weeks
4739066 fort randall is now at 20 500 cfs and it will maintain that until about sunday and then it will go up to 21 000
4739067 thats not much of an adjustment and they will hold it through the end of the month
4739068 in october we will start to draw randall down and put a hole in it
4739069 we can then accept releases from oahe and big bend over the winter when the current level is drawn down by 15 feet
4739070 there isnt much need to support navigation in that reach between omaha and sioux city so we are not supporting any commercial traffic
4739071 we can cut our release and continue to support water in the reservoirs its a balance to do a bit of both
4739072 we review the current status reports coming off the river from monitoring crews
4739073 its essentially a routine coordination process until we end up needing to make some modifications to the system operations
4739074 if there is an increase in releases by 1 000 cfs thats about two inches that the water will rise in the river level
4739075 our release is pretty locked in for the year our forecast is half the normal generation
4739076 its one of those things if youre not releasing water youre not making electricity
4739077 last year the wapa folks that market the power that we generate had to buy 123 million worth of electricity on the open market to make up for what was not produced in 2007
4739078 they had to go out and buy power when it was much more expensive wapa had two pretty significant rate increases that they charged their customers

4739157 developmental agency to be dissolved we should face squarely the issues at stake some of these issues concern the abandonment of construction sites by contractors who have collected money and failed to complete their jobs
4739158 you read in the papers recently the nddcs director of finance and administration chief p z agininghan lamenting the spade of abandoned contracts that should concern every stakeholders in the region why are construction companies abandoning sites what should be done to bring them back on site i want a situation whereby construction works would be taking place in the region because that has been our cry and there are reasons why the youths took up arms in the first place since independence no concrete efforts have been made to develop their region despite the huge gains to the nigerian state from this region for over 50 years now

4739223 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4739224 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4739225 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4739226 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4739227 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4739228 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4739229 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4739230 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4739231 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4739232 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4739233 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4739234 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4739235 their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and lay the foundations for measures that are needed to counteract such change
4739236 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4739237 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4739238 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4739239 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4739240 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4739241 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4739242 a lot of people think that the impact they make by adopting energy saving strategies is so miniscule that it doesnt make a difference
4739243 however if more small businesses began adopting green practices the businesses would not only save money but there would be a marked decrease in pollution for instance on the tv show extreme makeover home edition they built a house so energy efficient that it generates more power than it consumes imagine not having to pay the electricity bill every month for your business and being perceived by your customers as a socially responsible company
4739244 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4739245 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4739246 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4739247 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4739248 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4739249 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4739250 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4739251 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4739252 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4739253 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4739254 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4739255 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4739256 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4739257 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4739258 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4739259 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4739260 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4739261 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4739262 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4739263 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4739264 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4739265 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4739266 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4739267 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4739268 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4739269 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4739270 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4739271 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4739272 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4739273 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4739274 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4739275 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4739276 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick

4739280 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4739281 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4739282 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4739283 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4739284 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4739285 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4739286 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4739287 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4739288 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4739289 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4739290 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4739291 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4739292 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4739293 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4739294 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4739295 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4739296 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4739297 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4739298 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4739299 what do you want your look to say to people
4739300 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4739301 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4739302 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4739303 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4739304 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4739305 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4739306 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4739307 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4739308 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4739309 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4739310 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4739311 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4739312 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4739313 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4739314 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4739315 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4739316 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4739317 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4739318 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4739319 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4739320 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4739321 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4739322 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4739323 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4739324 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4739325 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4739326 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4739327 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4739328 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4739329 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4739330 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4739331 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4739332 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4739333 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4739334 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4739335 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4739336 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4739337 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4739338 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4739339 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4739340 regarding the cameras you can choose gt presentation cam for your own golfer if you are gt playing in tour pro this is disabled in other modes gt due to the spin you can add to the ball while its in gt flight
4739341 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4739342 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4739343 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4739344 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4739345 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4739346 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4739347 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4739348 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4739349 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4739350 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4739351 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4739352 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4739353 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4739354 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4739355 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4739356 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4739357 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4739358 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4739359 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4739360 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4739361 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4739362 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4739363 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4739364 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4739365 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4739366 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4739367 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4739368 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4739369 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4739370 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4739371 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4739372 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4739373 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4739374 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4739375 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4739376 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4739377 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4739378 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4739379 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4739380 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4739381 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4739382 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4739383 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4739384 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4739385 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4739386 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4739387 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4739388 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4739389 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4739390 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4739391 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4739393 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4739394 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4739395 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4739396 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4739397 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4739398 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4739399 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4739400 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4739401 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4739402 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4739403 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4739404 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4739405 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4739406 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4739407 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4739408 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4739409 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4739410 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4739411 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4739412 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4739413 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4739414 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4739415 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4739416 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4739417 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4739418 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4739419 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4739420 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4739421 we have finally got an understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4739422 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4739423 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4739424 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4739425 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4739426 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4739427 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4739428 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4739429 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4739430 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4739431 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4739432 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4739433 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4739434 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4739435 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4739436 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4739437 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4739438 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4739439 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4739440 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4739441 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4739442 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4739443 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4739444 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4739445 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4739446 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4739447 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4739448 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4739449 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4739450 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4739451 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4739452 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4739453 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4739454 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4739455 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4739456 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4739457 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4739458 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4739459 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4739460 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4739461 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4739462 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4739463 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4739464 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
4739465 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
4739466 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4739467 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4739468 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
4739469 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
4739470 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
4739471 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
4739472 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4739473 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4739474 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4739475 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4739476 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4739477 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4739478 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4739479 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4739480 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4739481 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4739482 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4739483 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4739484 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4739485 there is a dead body in your parkway do you know anything about it
4739486 nope i didnt hear anything i returned from my friends place early morning around 3 30 am didnt notice anything particular then
4739487 so you returned at 3 30am and you didnt see anything and didnt notice anything unusual
4739488 yeah thats true but i am not sure of the time it might have been earlier than 3 30am it should be around 3 00am as i retired to bed at 3 30am
4739489 we had the best race we ever had its galling i am always in those finishes and always seem to be the wrong side of the margin but its an olympic bronze medal
4739490 i shouted with 250m to go we can do this i really honestly thought we were on a charge but we just left a little bit too much to do but its annas first final and everything else and the pressure was really there it was a cracking race and it was a really good race
4739491 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4739492 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4739493 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4739494 thank you for being a friend travel down the road and back again your heart is true youre a pal and a confidant
4739495 last dance with mary jane one more time to kill the pain i feel summer creepin in and im tired of this town again
4739496 well i guess i could finish reading pride and prejudice while nancys page opens
4739497 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4739498 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4739499 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4739500 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4739501 next time i get a penalty i will try and put things right i am not scared
4739502 i am always confident i have 38 goals this season it is not a problem if i miss one or two i try to do my best in every game
4739503 since i have been in manchester i have scored 15 or 16 penalties i think and missed two
4739504 no one has said anything to me because i always try to score to play well
4739505 while you have to respect the decision of the referee he did not make the best decisions
4739506 too many decisions went to barcelona he gave us nothing
4739507 it wasnt the best game in barcelona but in manchester we will try to win
4739508 barcelona wont keep the ball like they did in this match and well create more chances
4739509 it will be a different game and im sure were going to play better we are at home we will have 75 000 people behind us we will try to play good football and try to win
4739510 we are optimistic as we will play a lot differently than we did at the nou camp
4739511 we will attack barcelona and see how they deal with it
4739512 they had a lot of possession but did not really penetrate us we had a strategy and played really well
4739513 effects of climate change are being noticed in ecosystems across the country and mumbai being a coastal city could be hit the hardest by rising sea water levels and a possible reduction in fish catch as a fallout of global warming it is critical that all concerned citizens come forward and participate in this unique endeavor
4739514 it is heartening to see a young group of concerned citizens come forward to address climate crisis wwf india encourages the spirit of responsible adventure and supports the pioneering spirit in bringing to the fore actions for betterment of the environment we hope that this small yet powerful activity creates a greater understanding about climate change and triggers larger actions by citizens and institutions to address global warming
4739515 kamu sekali kali tidak sampai kepada kebajikan yang sempurna sebelum kamu menafkahkan sebahagian harta yang kamu cintai dan apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka sesungguhnya allah mengetahuinya

4739517 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4739518 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4739519 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4739520 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4739521 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4739522 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4739523 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4739524 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4739525 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4739526 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4739527 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

4739542 the population of balmer island increases to 100 000 duing the summer months to reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians the town council of balmer island should limit the number of mopeds rented by each of the islands six moped and bicycle rental companies from 50 per day to 30 per day during the summer season by limiting the number of rentals the town council is sure to attain the 50 percent reduction in moped accidents that was achieved last year in the neighboring island of torseau when torseaus town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals

4739549 when i saw the replay when i saw i took that extra half stroke i thought i lost the race

4739551 phelps had a chance to win eight and lost to some guy
4739552 those are the differences in swimming everything counts you cant even show one one hundredth of a second on tv its that close
4739553 i knew i was leading the race i usually swim a faster first 50 and phelps is a back half swimmer so i knew hed be chasing me at the end i saw a shadow in the side of my goggles so the final eight meters i just put my head down didnt breathe and hoped for the best
4739554 how does it feel to be the one man who beat phelps
4739555 i didnt beat phelps maybe im the only guy who had a real shot of beating phelps this is all completely new to me i felt so much pressure and im very proud i was able to control my emotions and get so close it was an honor for me to race michael phelps with all eyes on me if we got to do it again id win it

4739608 when dna sequence data began to pour in after the early 1980s the situation changed dramatically
4739609 molecular evolutionists had largely abandoned the null hypothesis of selection to explain observed molecular differences and accepted the neutral theory even the molecular evolutionists who argue for the importance of selection at the dna level construct and use models for which the neutral theory is the assumption

4739615 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4739616 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4739617 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4739618 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4739619 they probably will be the third team in our group
4739620 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday
4739621 i did everything i could do we banged it out and he came up the winner
4739622 we thought he was going to fight as a righty and he fought as a lefty
4739623 i was trying to counterpunch him but when i fell behind its hard to do the catch up
4739624 this is not the end of the road for shawn estrada

4739629 ladies and gentlemen please say hello to our presidential candidate mr hank obama
4739630 a dinosaur out of context is like a character without a story worse than that the character suffers from amnesia
4739631 first off that quote is in reference to specimens taken from the field before the proper scientific studies have been completed
4739632 when this bone was found nobody recorded its location or other relevant data its a worthless piece of bone because it is out of context
4739633 science is about falsification not verification as an educator my primary job is to show people including kids how science works so that they too can then search for contrary evidence
4739634 well heres the evidence its up to you to make up your own mind
4739635 aunque siempre es bueno ver que los empleados est n concentrados en su trabajo las olimpiadas son una ocasi n especial
4739636 construir un ambiente positivo en la oficina en torno a un evento de esta magnitud puede unificar a los compa eros de trabajo y animarlos a airear su orgullo nacional
4739637 i have a paradox for you there are three boxes labeled a b and c one and only one of the three boxes contains a gold coin the other two are empty i will prove to you that regardless of which of the three boxes you pick the probability that it contains the gold coin is one in two
4739638 since there are three boxes the probability is clearly one in three
4739639 and thats what makes it a paradox i will give you a proof that the probability is one in two and your problem is to find the error in the proof since the proof must obviously contain an error
4739640 lets suppose you pick box a now the coin is with equal probability in any of the boxes so if box b should be empty then the chances are fifty fifty that the coin is in box a
4739641 also if box c is empty then again the chances are fifty fifty that the coin is in box a
4739642 but at least one of the boxes b or c must be empty and whichever one is empty the chances are fifty fifty that the coin is in box a therefore the chances are fifty fifty period
4739643 lets suppose you pick box a now the coin is with equal probability in any of the boxes so if box b should be empty then the chances are fifty fifty that the coin is in box a
4739644 but at least one of the boxes b or c must be empty and whichever one is empty the chances are fifty fifty that the coin is in box a
4739645 theres a 1 2 probability that box a has the coin
4739646 theres a 1 2 probability that box a does not have the coin
4739647 again theres a 2 3 probability that box c is empty
4739648 theres a 1 2 probability that box a has the coin
4739649 theres a 1 2 probability that box a does not have the coin
4739650 you have 3 quarters 1 two headed 2 two tailed 3 one head one tail you put them all in a bag then you pull one out looking only at the top its a head whats on the other side
4739651 you have 3 quarters 1 two headed 2 two tailed 3 one head one tail you put them all in a bag then you pull one out looking only at the top its a head whats on the other side
4739652 there is a 2 1 likelihood that the bottom and top of the coin are the same
4739653 or you can just note that if the drawn coin has a head it has to be either coin 1 or coin 3 and each is equally likely
4739654 the remaining coin is then simply a choice between coin 1 or coin 3
4739655 the conditional probability of event a1 given that event b0 has occurred is p a1 b0 0 5
4739656 but at least one of events b0 or c0 must occur and both p a1 b0 p a1 c0 0 5 therefore p a1 0 5
4739657 knowledge deduced after the selection cannot affect the results of the selection
4739658 what are the a priori probabilities for various selection outcomes
4739659 what are the a posteriori probabilities of various outcomes given some information about the results of the toss
4739660 even after seeing that one of the non a boxes is empty it remains a three box question

4739675 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4739676 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4739677 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4739678 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4739679 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second
4739680 it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4739681 what you did tonight was epic i never thought for one moment that you were out of the race

4739683 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud itll be exciting back home
4739684 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face
4739685 we thought we had a chance and we put our heads down it was probably ugly at that stage very ugly just digging deep it was beyond skills almost it was so primeval
4739686 emotions were feeding the brains and muscles but it was just auto pilot we were flying blind rowing blind we rowed from the heart
4739687 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4739688 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4739689 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4739690 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4739691 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4739705 if i havent seen it it must not be true
4739706 in fact the entire food industry of the world depends on the fact that evolution doesnt happen
4739707 well ive never seen no plants growing out of no toilets
4739708 ok now that theres life all i will do is mold it and change it i dont need to start from scratch any more
4739709 if evolution is real why do creatures lower than humans still exists why have humans been virtually unchanged for over 2500 years
4739710 your design blows here let me show you how my head should have turned out
4739711 if you look closely it looks like the peanut butter jar has been previously opened and the seal lifted a bit perhaps the new life was allowed to escape before this was filmed
4739712 but when i open the jar of peanut butter holy fuckin christ
4739713 who the hell do i have to blow to get a jar of peanut butter that doesnt have a life form in it around here this one you better make damn sure mister or your ass is evolving its way to the kerb
4739714 if you believe in evolution your just as dumb as this guy just thought i would make a point take a moment to reflect and have a good day knowing this
4739715 i dont understand why people get so pi ed when someone questions the evolution theory
4739716 in fact the entire food industry of the world depends on the fact that evolution doesnt happen
4739717 he who belongs to god hears what god says the reason you do not hear is that you do no belong to god
4739718 our evolutionism agree with it or go to your church to argue against it
4739719 seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open unto you
4739720 do what me and my disciples say and what the prophets of old have written
4739721 if while still blinking through the gloom and before he has become sufficiently accustomed to the environing darkness he is compelled in courtrooms or elsewhere to contend about the shadows of justice or the images that cast the shadows and to wrangle in debate about the notions of these things in the minds of those who have never seen justice itself
4739722 what youre saying is in one sense formally on the same level as insisting how silly it is to believe that jesus parted the red sea regardless of the actual merits it suggests such a limited grasp of the subject as to largely justify simply ignoring and or laughing at the speaker
4739723 you try to insist i lack in knowledge about the evolutionary theory while at the same time you say jesus parted the red sea
4739724 if you cant prove it with math and science then it doesnt and cant exist
4739725 sort of popped onto the scene with no gradual linkage from the
4739726 i sit here and read all your thoughts against what this dude is saying but yet not one of you people can refute what he says
4739727 no scientist would imagine no hypothesis predicts that life would start up in a peanut butter jar however it exactly happened it occured under conditions wildly different from the current earth and certainly not like a a jar of peanut butter they really dont expect life to be currently forming anywhere on earth but if it somehow started to it would almost certainly be eaten or degraded even before it was actually alive not to mention being unnoticeably microscopic i hope you all know that no responsible christian scholars believe in creationism its mostly radical fundamentalists and unfortunately some christians buy into it because theyre told that evolution is contradictory to the bible which is not true many christian scientists believe in many parts of evolution but we also believe that god did something distinct when it comes to humans maybe we did evolve from monkeys but if thats so god made humans special also evolution is not a theory about creation the big bang is normally the creation theory associated with evolution basically we have to believe one of two things either matter is eternal and something spontaneous happened to create life or there is an eternal god that designed the earth and life etc the way the earth is designed is so extraordinary that today many atheist secular scholars are recognizing that there may be intelligent design please do not be turned off from christianity because some radical fundamentalists are completely scientifically irresponsible huh is anyone going to eat that
4739728 besides if people came from monkeys then please tell me why there are still monkeys
4739729 if the pilgrims came from england then why are there still english people
4739730 there is truth in the bible but its not necessarily true look beyond the literal and find the truth within then you will find your path
4739731 first there will never be enough scientific evidence to conclude the existence of god
4739732 how do you propose to scientifically prove that someone or something man god or alien crafted every life form on this planet or even a tiny proportion of them
4739733 despite a lifelong love of peanut butter and jelly i have never once found god inside a sealed jar thereby conclusively and indisputably disproving divine creation
4739734 so if the theory of evolution is in fact true why are we yet to find the transitional fossils darwin himself said needed to be found within 100 years of the theory
4739735 actually paleontologists know of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate in form between various taxonomic groups
4739736 in fact the entire food industry of the world depends on the fact that evolution doesnt happen
4739737 what dose the scientist say to the tidal wave theyve never seen its not there

4739761 dia lah yang menciptakan kamu maka di antara kamu ada yang kafir dan di antaramu ada yang mukmin dan allah maha melihat apa yang kamu kerjakan
4739762 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kamu tentang agama apa yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepada ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kamu berpecah belah tentangnya amat berat bagi orang orang musyrik agama yang kamu seru mereka kepadanya allah menarik kepada agama itu orang yang dikehendaki nya dan memberi petunjuk kepada agama nya orang yang kembali kepada nya
4739763 muhammad itu adalah utusan allah dan orang orang yang bersama dengan dia adalah keras terhadap orang orang kafir tetapi berkasih sayang sesama mereka kamu lihat mereka ruku dan sujud mencari karunia allah dan keridhaan nya tanda tanda mereka tampak pada muka mereka dari bekas sujud demikianlah sifat sifat mereka dalam taurat dan sifat sifat mereka dalam injil yaitu seperti tanaman yang mengeluarkan tunasnya maka tunas itu menjadikan tanaman itu kuat lalu menjadi besarlah dia dan tegak lurus di atas pokoknya tanaman itu menyenangkan hati penanam penanamnya karena allah hendak menjengkelkan hati orang orang kafir dengan kekuatan orang orang mukmin allah menjanjikan kepada orang orang yang beriman dan mengerjakan amal yang saleh di antara mereka ampunan dan pahala yang besar
4739764 moderate muslim scholars said there were no reasons to reject homosexuals under islam and that the condemnation of homosexuals and homosexuality by mainstream ulema and many other muslims was based on narrow minded interpretations of islamic teachings
4739765 tidak ada perbedaan antara lesbian dengan non lesbian dalam pandangan tuhan manusia dihargai hanya berdasarkan ketaatannya
4739766 like gender bias or patriarchy heterogeneity bias is socially constructed it would be totally different if the ruling group was homosexuals
4739767 condemnation of homosexuality was voiced by two conservative muslim groups the indonesian ulema council mui and hizbut thahir indonesia hti
4739768 kami tidak akan menganggap homoseksualitas sebagai musuh tetapi kami akan membuat mereka sadar bahwa apa yang mereka lakukan adalah salah
4739769 it scripture does attest to the fact that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered and can in no case be approved of
4739770 siapa saja yang menemukan pria pelaku homoseks maka bunuhlah pelakunya tersebut
4739771 karena keinginan untuk menikahkan putrinya tidak kesampaian tentu luth amat kecewa luth kemudian menganggap kedua laki laki tadi tidak normal istri luth bisa memahami keadaan laki laki tersebut dan berusaha menyadarkan luth tapi oleh luth malah dianggap istri yang melawan suami dan dianggap mendukung kedua laki laki yang dinilai luth tidak normal kenapa luth menilai buruk terhadap kedua laki laki yang kebetulan homo tersebut sejauh yang saya tahu al quran tidak memberi jawaban yang jelas tetapi kebencian luth terhadap kaum homo di samping karena faktor kecewa karena tidak berhasil menikahkan kedua putrinya juga karena anggapan luth yang salah terhadap kaum homo
4739772 mengapa kalian mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorang pun sebelum kalian sesungguhnya kalian mendatangi laki laki untuk melepaskan syahwat bukan kepada wanita malah kalian ini kaum yang melampaui batas jawab kaumnya tidak lain hanya mengatakan
4739773 usirlah mereka dari kotamu ini sesungguhnya mereka adalah orang orang yang berpura pura mensucikan diri kemudian kami selamatkan dia dan pengikut pengikutnya kecuali istrinya dia termasuk orang orang yang tertinggal dibinasakan dan kami turunkan kepada mereka hujan batu maka perhatikanlah bagaimana kesudahan orang orang yang berdosa itu
4739774 ya kita tentu menyambut gembira upaya yang dilakukan oleh fakultas syariah iain walisongo tersebut
4739775 hanya orang primitif saja yang melihat perkawinan sejenis sebagai sesuatu yang abnormal dan berbahaya bagi kami tiada alasan kuat bagi siapapun dengan dalih apapun untuk melarang perkawinan sejenis sebab tuhan pun sudah maklum bahwa proyeknya menciptakan manusia sudah berhasil bahkan kebablasan
4739776 sebaik baik wanita ialah maryam binti imran dan sebaik baik wanita ialah khadijah binti khuwailid
4739777 lelaki yang sempurna ba nyak tetapi tidak demikian halnya bagi wanita kecuali asiah istri firaun dan mar yam binti imran dan sesung guhnya keutamaan aisyah atas wanita lainnya seperti ke utamaan tsarid lauk yang berminyak atas makanan lainnya
4739778 kaum laki laki itu adalah pemimpin bagi kaum wanita oleh karena allah telah melebihkan sebahagian mereka laki laki atas sebahagian yang lain wa nita dan karena mereka laki laki telah menafkahkan sebagian dari harta mereka sebab itu maka wanita yang saleh ialah yang taat kepada allah lagi memelihara diri ketika suaminya tidak ada oleh karena allah telah memelihara mereka
4739779 sebaik baik wanita adalah yang menawan hati mu bila engkau pandang taat manakala engkau perintah dan menjaga hartamu serta memelihara kehormatan diri nya ketika engkau tidak ada di rumah
4739780 dan barangsiapa yang men taati allah dan rasul nya mereka itu akan bersama sa ma dengan orang orang yang dianugerahi nikmat oleh allah yaitu nabi nabi para shiddiiqiin orang orang yang mati syahid dan orang orang shalih dan mereka itulah teman yang sebaik baiknya
4739781 semua ummatku akan masuk surga kecuali yang enggan tidak mau pa ra sahabat bertanya siapa kah yang enggan itu wahai rasulullah beliau men jawab barang siapa yang taat kepadaku mengikuti sunnahku dialah yang akan masuk surga dan barang siapa yang mendurhakaiku maka dialah yang yang enggan masuk surga
4739782 jika seorang isteri itu telah menunaikan shalat lima waktu dan shaum puasa di bulan ramadhan dan men jaga kemaluannya dari yang haram serta taat kepada suaminya maka akan di persilakan masuklah ke surga dari pintu mana saja kamu suka
4739783 tiap tiap isteri yang mati diridhai oleh suaminya maka ia akan masuk surga
4739784 tidak ada yang paling bermanfaat bagi se orang lelaki mukmin se su dah bertaqwa kepada allah daripada memiliki isteri yang shalihah yaitu jika ia di perintah ia taat jika ia dipan dang menye nangkan hati dan jika ia digilir ia tetap ber buat baik dan jika ia diting galkan suaminya ia tetap menjaga suaminya dalam hal dirinya dan harta suaminya
4739785 ada empat perkara siapa yang memilikinya berarti mendapat kebaikan di dunia dan akhirat yaitu hati yang bersyukur lisan yang selalu berzikir tubuh yang bersabar ketika ditimpa bala bencana musibah dan isteri yang ti dak menjerumuskan suami nya dan merusakkan harta bendanya
4739786 dahulu saya melihat mushab ini tak ada yang mengimbangi dalam memperoleh kesenangan dari orang tuannya kemudian ditinggalkannya semua itu demi cintanya kepada allah dan rasul nya
4739787 kami hijrah di jalan allah bersama rasulullah saw dengan mengharap keridhaan nya hingga pastilah sudah pahala di sisi allah di antara kami ada yang telah berlalu sebelum menikmati sedikitpun juga pahala di dunia ini termasuk mushab bin umair yang gugur di uhud ini
4739788 biarlah dunia berpisah denganmu asalkan sang pemilik dunia dan akhirat menghampirimu
4739789 dan kami wasiatkan perintahkan kepada manusia supaya berbuat baik kepada ibu bapaknya ibunya telah mengandungnya dengan menderita kelemahan diatas kelemahan dan menyapihnya dalam dua tahun bersyukurlah kepada ku dan kepada ibu bapakmu kepada ku tempat kembali dan jika keduanya memaksamu untuk mempersekutukan dengan aku sesuatu yang tidak ada pengetahuanmu tentang itu maka janganlah kamu mengikuti keduanya dan pergaulilah keduanya di dunia dengan baik dan ikutilah jalan orang yang kembali kepada ku kemudian hanya kepada kulah kembalimu maka ku beritakan kepadamu apa yang telah kamu kerjakan
4739790 setelah aku renungkan selama seminggu maka aku masuk islam sebagai orang ketiga
4739791 inilah pamanku coba tunjukkan padaku siapa yang punya paman seperti pamanku
4739792 tiga malam sebelum aku masuk islam aku bermimpi seolah olah aku tenggelam dalam kegelapan yang tindih menindih
4739793 ketika ibuku mengetahui aku masuk islam dia marah bukan kepalang
4739794 hai saad agama apa yang engkau anut sehingga engkau meninggalkan agama ibu bapakmu demi allah engkau harus meninggalkan agama barumu itu atau aku mogok makan minum sampai mati biar pecah jantungmu melihatku dan penuh penyesalan karena tindakanmu sendiri sehingga semua orang menyalahkan dan mencelamu selama lamanya
4739795 jangan lakukan itu bu bagaimanapun juga aku tidak akan meninggalkan agamaku
4739796 sesungguhnya aku sangat mencintai ibu tetapi aku lebih cinta kepada allah dan rasul nya demi allah seandainya ibu mempunyai seribu jiwa lalu jiwa itu keluar dari tubuh ibu sata persatu untuk memaksaku keluar dari agamaku sungguh aku tidak akan meninggalkan agamaku karananya
4739797 dan kalau keduanya memaksa engkau menyekutukan ku dengan apa yang engkau tidak ketahui jangan diturut dan pergaulilah keduanya di dunia dengan baik
4739798 tidak pernah rasulullah berucap kepada seorang juapun mempertaruhkan kedua ibu bapaknya sekaligus sebagai tebusan melainkan hanya kepadaku
4739799 hai saad janganlah engkau terpesona sekalipun engkau paman rasulullah dan sahabat beliau sesungguhnya allah tidak menghapus suatu kejahatan dengan kejahatan tetapi allah menghapus kejahatan dengan kebaikan hai saad sesungguhnya tidak ada hubungan kekeluargaan antara allah dengan seorangpun melainkan dengan mentaati nya segenap manusia sama di sisi allah baik ia bangsawan atau rakyat jelata allah adalah rabb mereka dan mereka semuanya adalah hamba hamba nya mereka berlebih berkurang karena taqwa dan memperoleh karunia dari allah karena taat perhatikan cara rasulullah yang engkau telah ketahui maka tetaplah ikuti cara beliau itu

4739801 ustadz saya heran melihat antum dan ustadz ustadz itu pakaian sama jenggot sama cara shalatnya sama sama sama mengikut sunnah dan anti bidah sama sama nampak baik kenapa tidak bisa bergaul dengan baik tidak saling tegur menegur kelompok antum sering disindir sindir dikatakan jahil sesat ahlul bidah kami dipesan tidak usah belajar dengan antum dan sebagainya
4739802 ikuti yang benar dan yang baik dan tinggalkan yang bathil dan yang buruk
4739803 menurut saya keterangan keterangan dari kedua belah pihak sama sama berdalil dari dan as sunnah
4739804 ustadz saya ini tidak ada ilmu baru mulai mengerti sunnah di sini dulu sibuk dengan urusan dunia sampai lupa tak mau belajar dan mendalami ilmu agama jadi saya ini tidak mengerti dan tidak bisa menilai siapa yang lebih benar tolonglah beritahu dan tunjukkan
4739805 kalau begitu sudahlah diam saja dan memohon kepada allah taala mudah mudahan mimpi tersebut banyak membawa kebaikan

4739845 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4739846 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4739847 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4739848 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4739849 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4739850 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4739851 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4739852 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4739853 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4739854 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4739855 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4739856 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4739857 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4739858 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4739859 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4739860 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4739861 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4739862 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4739863 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4739864 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4739865 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4739866 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4739867 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4739868 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4739869 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4739870 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4739871 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4739872 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4739873 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4739874 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4739875 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4739876 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4739877 who are open to doing something on the production side
4739878 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4739879 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4739880 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4739881 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4739882 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4739883 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4739884 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4739885 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4739886 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4739887 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4739888 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4739889 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4739890 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4739891 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4739892 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4739893 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4739894 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4739895 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4739896 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4739897 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4739898 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4739899 we have heard of 24 7 but why 22 7
4739900 one more step and yer bastards fly into the next world minced like hamburgers
4739901 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4739902 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4739903 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4739904 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4739905 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4739906 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4739907 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4739908 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4739909 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4739910 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4739911 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4739912 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4739913 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4739914 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4739915 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4739916 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4739917 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4739918 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4739919 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4739920 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4739921 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4739922 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4739923 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4739924 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4739925 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4739926 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4739927 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4739928 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4739929 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4739930 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4739931 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4739932 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4739933 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4739934 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4739935 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4739936 one of the most disjointed novels ive read in a long while
4739937 the lord hath no scorn like the scorn reserved for one star reviewers
4739938 obviously the infallbile kjv stands alone as a paragon of exactitude percision undeniability brevity bombastictness and hysterectomy
4739939 i probably shouldnt have seen the movie first the ending is real trippy but it takes too long to get there theres a huge cliffhanger at the end that was probably a set up for a sequel that will never be written though the first half is better in fact you can totally disregard the second part entirely it was an unnecessary addition the author accomplishes everything needed by the end of the first part
4739940 the author accomplishes everything needed by the end of the first part
4739941 for those of you who dont know this is gods second novel after the old testament its a marked improvement in my opinion he got rid of a lot of his previous angst and scorn and has really begun to show some of the maturity present in his later works hes become a much more loving and kind god and noticeably he doesnt throw nearly as many tantrums as he did in the first book
4739942 very historically accurate portrayal of what actually happened i finally realize that harry potter and lord of the rings are lies the magic in this book is more realistic
4739943 you know whats funny monkeys and midgets you know whats not this book its serious dont buy it get a copy from a jehovas witness next time they come to your door
4739944 i would have liked to hear the story from a first person narrative dictated by
4739945 based on all the hype i thought this book would change my life but it didnt in fact i found it to be fairly disjointed and at times contradictory there were too many perspectives and the story didnt really even have a cohesive plot this is the most overrated book ive read since the da vinci code
4739946 im not generally a fan of fantasy fiction but i felt obligated to read this title it being the popular example of the genre the story has a good premise that i cant help but think suffers in its implementation
4739947 there arent enough good fights in this book and i think harry potter is better at magic than jerus some magic was great like the feeding of one hundred from only ten or eleven fish but apart from that nothing special read most but not all of it as after noer it was kind of boring that guy lived for years update finished good ending
4739948 i picked this up because i heard it advertised as the gospel which translates to
4739949 all characters portayed in this book are purely fictional and any resemblance to people alive or dead is purely coincidental
4739950 its not how good you are its how good you want to be
4739951 being a single mom i have to take care of my kids financially and its extremely important that they dont worry about bills paying 70 a month for peace of mind is worth it
4739952 no matter what insurance you have you need to have protection on your mortgage
4739953 the cost of living in toronto is getting higher and higher so this is a bad combination for those without insurance
4739954 where do i get my ideas from you might as well have asked that of beethoven he was goofing around in germany like everybody else and all of a sudden this stuff came gushing out of him it was music
4739955 tres cosas puedes hacer con una mujer quererla sufrir por ella y finalmente convertirla en literatura
4739956 it shows that no matter what you set your mind to anything can happen
4739957 i saw so many quotes saying its impossible to duplicate that it wont happen but bob bowman phelps coach is the one who helped me to really dream about anything bob and i have gone through a lot together and its all paid off
4739958 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4739959 we didnt want them to go to sleep feeling like something was lost and they didnt have a chance
4739960 although the rules dont allow for team officials to watch video footage we did give them the opportunity to see for themselves after the competition the serbian team was very satisfied and agreed with the decision by the referee
4739961 when i did chop that last stroke i really though it cost me the race
4739962 i ended up making the right decision trying to take a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first turned out to be in my favor
4739963 in that situation its the lesser of two evils either youre going to glide or take half a stroke
4739964 he did a much better job taking half a stroke
4739965 one one hundreth of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4739966 its a complete miracle to me that i am here
4739967 i retired a year and a half ago so im enjoying this moment from my heart i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish im not angry at all

4739984 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4739985 would nba commissioner david stern and the league hold the american players accountable i think the answer to that is yes so why wouldnt he hold the other nba players accountable unless the rules only apply to the american players
