3460009 in a market where it is notoriously difficult to attract and retain female users makefriendsonline is very proud and protective of its female membership which at 51 is probably the best male female ratio youll find anywhere we would not want to alienate our female members by offering a feature that makes them uncomfortable and certainly not one which would actively put them off joining our site we will therefore not be adding webcams to mfo

3460012 es ist ungeheuerlich wenn strafverfolgung gegen internetseiten mit strafrechtlicher relevanz in deutschland mit der blockierung von seiten von amnesty international in china verglichen wird

3460041 would not be in the best interest of the community
3460042 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3460043 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3460044 there will be a struggle because of distortions created by the media which has clearly made its stand that it opposes the charter it makes this stand in editorial comments and interviews only those who oppose the charter
3460045 by the time you go out many will have made up their minds they wont accept the charter and thats why you need to understand what it is about before going out
3460046 ask yourself how you feel about it if you feel it is not good for fiji then it is best to opt out now rather than be part of the ship and undermine it
3460047 after that we will allow the public time to read and digest information and then we will hold public discussions in towns and villages before votes are gathered
3460048 the new schools have different messages and themes and they are using tadra kahani to highlight them tadra kahani is a fullscale stage production performed by young people it is about creative art in our youth and their expression through creative art of strong lifestyle messages
3460049 tickets are selling at 8 for the first two nights and 10 for the final the students are from around fiji including gau nadi nadroga tavua and suva
3460050 there are three new schools in both divisions and because of the record number there will be three nights of dynamite entertainment from our young people
3460051 there are 60 students and our theme is based on culture shock we left qamea on saturday and the students are looking forward to this
3460052 we have decided in the next six weeks to counter issues affecting members of the sdl party fijian people
3460053 the strategy we have decided on is to work with christian churches especially the methodist church two of us sdl executives are part of the methodist church think tank and the sdls stand on the charter is almost the same as the church
3460054 the church standing committee chaired by reverend manasa lasaro will make a decision on our submission
3460055 that way we wont have to waste our resources going to the rural areas we will get to people coming to suva over the next two weeks in one or two pages we will summarise points that we will touch on to our members so that they can read and understand it rather than give them 30 odd pages of the peoples charter we should complete it in two days
3460056 what we will do is members will select special topics then speak to their people on it through radio tv and newspapers we are aware of what has been said in the media warning us about making inciteful comments
3460057 we do not intend to make inciteful statements we wont be saying anything new on the charter all the releases will be in relation to the charter and we intend to uphold the law
3460058 but we could have sat down and come to a solution its a pity that political parties have not taken an active role and come to the table to thrash things out
3460059 it depends on what magnitude the campaign is going to be
3460060 but you can bet that the police will keep an eye out for this campaign
3460061 the police will standby to see that the sdl campaign is not inciteful or seditious and that it does not cause havoc
3460062 the sdl is entitled to embark on a fiji wide awareness program to counter the efforts of the labour party and military junta because the heavy handed one sided manner in which the junta and ncbbf have gone about the entire process invites such reactions and is yet a demonstration of how uninterested the junta and flp are in uniting our people
3460063 the apprehension of individuals who expressed an opposing view to the charter shows just how little faith the ncbbf and junta has in their document to be able to withstand public scrutiny
3460064 they have to rely on military and police aggression and intimidation tactics to ensure its survival
3460065 they may as well go ahead and implement their proposed changes and be done with it
3460066 considering the moral or principal of constitutional changes is just not a high priority right now for majority of our people and understandably so
3460067 they are in desperate need of steady water supply housing decent roads and the basic infrastructure facilities that all governments are obliged to provide the people
3460068 they approached me and told me that i could not board my flight because they wanted to interview me i was surprised because i thought they would interview me in labasa
3460069 basically the only thing i am upset about is being being stopped at the last minute no one had informed me before i told the officers to let me go but they said they had special orders from the cid office to stop me from leaving its not like i am running away or flying out of the country and they could have easily interviewed me in labasa or i would have gone to the police station myself
3460070 i am in the police van right now being taken to the cid headquarters
3460071 i dont feel threatened in any way but i stand by what i said
3460072 they asked me everything they wanted to know i thought it was something urgent but it was just normal questions about what i said i was treated with respect like any other citizen
3460073 it would be a very minor change and this will not make any difference to the unions request for a review of fares
3460074 we are not aware and at this stage dont know the price differences so we will comment later
3460075 the board of education has focued on breaking promises with the public grandstanding in the media campaigning for re election and fueling an unhealthy situation that has led to teachers leaving csd 158 to work for districts who offer competitive salaries and benefits
3460076 at this time two more vessels have just been tied up and more will follow as major maintenance is required we are fast approaching the point of no return this being when our key men captains fishing masters and engineers are laid off
3460077 nations all over the world almost without exception have jumped to support their fishing industries with tax cuts and outright subsidies to keep their national fleets alive knowing the consequences of losing their national fleet
3460078 we have noted that there are a total of 14 activities happening around the country in the coming weeks and we will try our best to maintain a safe and secure atmosphere for everyone
3460079 that is our main priority and the aim of this operation
3460080 our officers will be going in different urban and rural communities throughout the country to patrol in full gear this means they will be carrying their food and sleeping gear with them while they are out
3460081 this includes officers doing 24 hour door to door patrols and even guarding peoples farms and plantations
3460082 this is the first time ever and its a new trend for us
3460083 the response from the hotel and motel owners was good as they have agreed to work with us the owners have also requested police to monitor bootleggers
3460084 we have run special workshops to train our officers on how to catch these illegal operators and get hold of drunkards disturbing others we are also trying to be very fair to ensure the law applies to everyone or all liquor sellers
3460085 the hibiscus safe campaign goal is to increase the level of knowledge and promote individual and social responsibility towards the prevention of stis and hiv and reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with and affected by hiv
3460086 i think the question of penalties for drugs should be looked at carefully and very soon
3460087 for the existing law it doesnt differentiate between the various types of drugs whether its marijuana cocaine amphetamine or some other hard drugs whether its for personal use or for sale whether its one ounce or 10 tonnes
3460088 as it is drug cases have only one penalty maximum 1million fine or life imprisonment
3460089 unfortunately the law on drugs as i have said many times before is pitifully deficient on the question of penalty
3460090 it has left the whole thing to the discretion of the magistrate or the judge so how does the magistrate or the judge exercise his discretion because each individual exercises it differently
3460091 ive campaigned for a long time but nothing has been done
3460092 issues have been raised by counsel on ms banwaris evidence given in court yesterday state now has to disclose the entire statement to defence counsel so in all fairness i have to give the defence counsel some time to analyse the document
3460093 i cant proceed further before the disclosures are looked at by the defence counsel
3460094 we will provide them with the disclosures and they have been granted time to examine these documents
3460095 there was something else discussed which i cannot tell you which is the reason behind the adjournment and the matter resuming tomorrow today
3460096 the ministry has the responsibility of ensuring school heads and teachers provide an environment that is safe so those caught sniffing glue should be reprimanded
3460097 the detention of the journalist goes against the commitment of media freedom by the fiji government pina calls for a concerted effort by regional leaders to demand fiji keeps its promises
3460098 this is getting out of hand and the fiji media council supported by the people of fiji need to stand united against any threats to freedom of expression and rule of law the interim government needs to respect the rights of its people
3460099 these actions are clearly undermining the forums efforts to assist fiji return to democratic rule said mr ealedona
3460100 they cannot perform their role if there is continuous intimidation and threats to the profession
3460101 sigatoka is a tourist town and as long as we have tourists businesses will continue to operate and expand
3460102 over the year we have seen about 13 new shops open up for business which is a good sign as things are starting to pick up despite the hardships people are going through
3460103 tourism is coming back slowly the township of sigatoka relies heavily on tourism to keep it going
3460104 in the past many members had not shown interest so the chamber went defunct
3460105 but we are trying our best to get things back on track
3460106 once batiri has power then food processors can vacuum pack and can fruits and vegetables right here in batiri and this will be exported directly to overseas markets
3460107 this is a good investment because it serves well to fulfill the governments intentions of reducing imports
3460108 our core business at this stage is planting and selling but with power we can use this as a buying centre for farms from all around batiri citrus boasts 385 acres yet only half of that is under production
3460109 as the owner of 100 per cent of the companys shares the government must invest to lift the company out of the hand and mouth existence it currently operates at
3460110 mr urwin made advancement of regional cooperation in the pacific throughout his career with the department of foreign affairs and trade and subsequently as secretary general of the forum secretariat
3460111 the professionalism and dedication shown by the detectives involved in this investigation has been outstanding
3460112 i am pleased for them and for the family members of jayanti naidu that the matter has culminated in an arrest today
3460113 we are awaiting the arrival of sir paul and the commonwealth so that the dates for the political forum are finalised
3460114 the purpose of the book is to promote dialogue and commitment to social justice in parishes and churches
3460115 we have identified the social issues affecting the society but the real concern is how we can move from just identifying it
3460116 i did my homework in prison and when i was released in 1993 i was given a second chance to get into serious art now my drawings are selling at the thousand dollar mark
3460117 life in prison is hell it aint a bed of roses
3460118 character skills and employment opportunities as shown in palms 78 72
3460119 what good are the skills if they are not accompanied by character of heart a person cannot be effective in life without skills we need people with character and skills
3460120 we believe in awareness acceptance and action we believe inmates have two prisons
3460121 to help unlock them from the second prison is the joint responsibility of society the church and other stakeholders
3460122 the prisons commissioner can come up with the most effective rehabilitation program but who does he hand it to when they leave prison
3460123 he needs the assistance of the church the vanua and families to help unlock the second prison and accept them back into society
3460124 we intend to sponsor or adopt an inmate until they leave the prison gates and enter society
3460125 but if we are to reduce the level of criminal activities in fiji there is a need for us to develop a sustainable rehabilitation program for ex convicts
3460126 in order for this to be achieved the support from society as a whole is necessary including the former victims every prisoner is a member of some family and could be a brother sister uncle aunt father mother son or daughter so the immediate family needs to reconcile itself with the prisoner
3460127 obviously not all prisoners will adapt to the changed or new environment because it would depend to some extent on just how entrenched their problem is
3460128 however for every individual who manages to turn against crime thats at least one or more victims that we save from a possible violent or fatal encounter
3460129 if the project succeeds in turning around just 10 per cent of the prisoners who undergo the program then it would be well worth the effort
3460130 i congratulate the organisers and call on everyone who can help to offer a lending hand to the yellow ribbon project

3460137 this would be great to win a free subscription thanks i am a new homeschooler i am sure it would be very helpful
3460138 remember the pre computer days when this kind of fun was slightly less easy
3460139 except for crimes of violence against women and children which men of any background commit and which has its roots in gender inequality and discrimination then there are also political crimes
3460140 for those who commit crimes of violence against women and children they need to undergo a different type of treatment from specialists
3460141 their minds need to be re educated so that they respect women as their equals but these people are more readily accepted in society because society does not take criminal assault in the home seriously
3460142 if given a chance unless the person has a psychological problem which needs appropriate attention people can change and have changed but it is also true that there is a great stigma on those who have served prison terms particularly for crimes against property robberies etc and child rape
3460143 if prisoners have done their time then they should be given a chance
3460144 this can be very difficult but i believe religious organisations families and non government organisations such as the ex prisoners association can help and support
3460145 after all these are people who were caught and have served their time what of those who are among us and continue to commit crimes and get away with bribery corruption criminal assault in the home sexual harassment political crimes such as stealing a government
3460146 new manufacturing processes will needed but once that problem is solved nanoantennas should easily best solar cells in efficiency and production costs

3460150 alienating the power users is a sure way to drive them to other services and their audiences with them
3460151 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3460152 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3460153 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level
3460154 it is difficult to create forecasts for mobile video and mobile tv advertising due to the fact that the market is still fragmented and undeveloped
3460155 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3460156 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
3460157 there are some surprises beneath the surface of the latitude line as well

3460159 ive never been so excited since i started playing handball
3460160 i admit we are not still not as good as the european teams what we have to do is show our best in every coming match
3460161 its very hard for european teams to play korea because we dont play them too often they are very very fast very good at movements and attacks
3460162 it was the result of our pressure we got a lot of penalty corners and won off a penalty corner
3460163 we woke up in the second half and played with a lot more emotion a lot more power which you didnt see at the beginning
3460164 we knew it was going to be not the cleanest of games out there and we tried really hard to play a decent game of hockey
3460165 the coach told me to push forward and not be so passive
3460166 i think he is the greatest coach in the world
3460167 for me it was very difficult because the chinese do not understand this i was lucky because two months later there were the asian games and we won everything so after that they left me alone
3460168 next year you have national games and its more important than world championships next year the national team is finished all the people go back to their provinces for this competition
3460169 i feel happy very happy im thankful to possess such a wonderful magic horse
3460170 i just had a feeling about the horse i just liked his outline his silhouette
3460171 i was thrilled to be in form and i felt like id done everything that id set out to do and it just got better and better and better
3460172 that was a huge stone that fell from my heart
3460173 its always amazing to come home from your first games with some kind of bling so any color will do
3460174 it has been very successful on lots of levels i know i can be competitive at this level now that ive had this break i have freshened up
3460175 it was really good work by birgit to get by two defenders
3460176 its typical birgit to go like that and win it but as a forward i have to expect and anticipate that the goalkeeper will not be able to hold that shot
3460177 i dont think the result is because japans was a fantastic performance
3460178 after 3 1 down we got the message that the united states was three or four goals up and we needed a get a point in order to win the group
3460179 we gambled and put more players up front and a few less in defense and japan was very good at counter attack
3460180 the most important thing for us is to forget the game and start thinking about the quarterfinal against brazil
3460181 going up that early in the game was just an awesome start for us
3460182 we dont know the reason why these accusations have been made but we believe my sister and her husband are innocent they are good honorable people who have it in their hearts to help people not hurt them
3460183 its moments like these that make me proud to be a lawyer dr vans children have suffered greatly by not having physical contact with their mother
3460184 they have agreed to release their lease once they harvest their pine
3460185 but we would also have to secure the consent for lease for the access roads to the mining area
3460186 we are also securing a mining lease for the actual 70 hectares that will be mined
3460187 we are willing to terminate our pine lease but were also trying to establish how long they will hold on to their mining lease so that we can replant once they are finished
3460188 this would be a major investment that could trigger greater developments in bua
3460189 a team that went boar hunting came back and informed the village elders
3460190 the villagers then came and told our officers in keiyasi about it
3460191 it was a big bust and we thank the villagers for their efforts
3460192 that shows the villagers are responding positively to operation valoma
3460193 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
3460194 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was 30
3460195 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else

3460251 at this point the various reports are so mutually contradictory that some of them have to be wrong
3460252 however if indeed 11 people died in a single event that would make this the second worst himalayan tragedy in history the worst occurred when 16 climbers were killed in an avalanche on nanga parbat in 1937 seven germans and nine porters
3460253 i cant be sure but my guess is that the serac that collapsed was this big ice cliff hanging over the bottleneck which while climbing k2 in 1992 i jokingly called the motivator the idea being that you want to get out from under it as soon as possible
3460254 we still dont know what really happened but some of the climbers reached the summit as late as 8 p m i can imagine them coming down exhausted and counting on the fixed ropes when the ropes where gone its possible some waited for daylight and a few perhaps tried to down climb the difficult terrain but fell off

3460289 here comes my annual punch list of things to consider when designing multi player games updated and expanded from last year based on what weve learned this is named for the character from
3460290 it was that damn random event that did me in
3460291 even an entire society a nation or all simultaneously existing societies taken together are not owners of the earth they are simply its possessors its beneficiaries and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations
3460292 new society will have emerged from capitalist society which is thus in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges
3460293 the strike was very successful we shut down the operation for four days and we were on a work to rule from monday to wednesday this week everyone stood together on both shifts despite attempts by the company to give us different deals
3460294 this isnt an offer its a piss take who in their right mind is going to accept what is an effective pay freeze
3460295 this sends a strong message that we are serious about this years pay talks and the wider bus campaign
3460296 we are going to recruit to the union and campaign for the strike
3460297 management is continuing its onslaught over the national insurance numbers with people continuing to receive letters suspending them from work
3460298 we are asking cleaners in the unite union who have also been balloted to strike with us
3460299 with all the disputes including tube lines coming together we can make an impact
3460300 the impact of slowing economic activity has not yet been fully felt the default cycle has only just started thats the bad news and theres plenty of it
3460301 i now fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important the political legitimacy of the market economy itself
3460302 i no longer believe in the markets self healing power
3460303 let my people pogo the great monkey the curse of the babel fishbone
3460304 we are looking for beautiful charismatic women who are willing to put in the effort to become a true model
3460305 im damned if ill crawl my childrens children crawl on the earth in some kind a fuckin harmony with the environment yeah till the next ice age or the next asteroid impact
3460306 people shouldnt be afraid of their government governments should be afraid of their peoples
3460307 what is the simplest system that drives forward the player experience
3460308 how long does it take you to reach 1 000 000 points
3460309 wouldnt this merlot taste so much better if it didnt make the inside of my mouth all fuzzy
3460310 what percentage of the reviewers fit any of the following criteria never played a 3d platformer mostly enjoy casual games like bejeweled prefer social board games like pictionary or scrabble
3460311 have a place in telling people which games they should play
3460312 what will it take for the game industry to adapt to the fact that different gamers like different games
3460313 its like meeting a girl who is cute and smart but really really likes the whole dressing up their boyfriend in black duct tape and then whipping them until they bleed from unmentionable orifices
3460314 for example being able to respawn ten seconds away from where you died would make the goals so much less rewarding because it would make them too easy in a game where your character can die the death has to mean something has to take something away from you
3460315 if super mario galaxy had a demo i would have tried it out and likely given it a pass
3460316 i should have been able to play a demo of this game then i wouldnt have bought it
3460317 but basically there isnt really any difference between spirituality and your regular life
3460318 byron was a no 1 pick the seventh overall in the draft
3460319 hes started in the league won games in the league were happy to have him here to kind of bail us out
3460320 its been the same injury time and time again but i never got it fixed because i wasnt a doctor and nobody told me hey you need to get that fixed
3460321 once i got it fixed its better now last year i got something different a high ankle sprain on the other ankle
3460322 your quarterbacks throwing motion is his throwing motion and thats not going to change a whole lot
3460323 everyone knows byrons got a little of an elongated motion and hes going to have to make it up with smarts and anticipation
3460324 i feel as though im a little slower with my windup so i just throw the ball faster and it gets there at the same time
3460325 i was impressed simply by the fact hes a quick study
3460326 he was able to step out there step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up actually and deliver the ball around hes a very sharp guy thats obvious i would guess hell be able to play on thursday
3460327 i just want to play football and help the team as much as i can
3460328 thats my mind set just go out there become a better player help this football team see what happens
3460329 its different because youre not the guy and you used to be the guy
3460330 we all know who the guy is my job is to prepare myself every day in case im needed and if im needed i have to go out there and we cant miss a beat and thats what im going to work myself toward
3460331 in the future we certainly both want to have kids
3460332 weve been together eight years we want to win a gold medal then have kids
3460333 there are a lot of mothers playing pro beach volleyball they all came back stronger and happier i hope to be pregnant soon after the olympics take a year off and come back
3460334 its hard to be so self involved for so long
3460335 six feet of sunshine is a superb blocker and great hitter but the 5 9 may treanor hammered a few spiked vs the cubans that looked like rockets off the hand of a player a foot taller
3460336 were more in control of ourselves and our game weve cleaned up every aspect of our game tightened everything up
3460337 how do you know if someone is the right person to marry
3460338 for me youre a little bit frozen in time a little bit alison poole the 21 year old party girl in that book who runs around new york going to nightclubs doing drugs and abusing credit cards
3460339 thats definitely a theme in my life seeker of truth
3460340 i was around him a lot it was great we went to africa the whole experience was life altering for me
3460341 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
3460342 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3460343 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3460344 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3460345 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3460346 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3460347 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3460348 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3460349 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3460350 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3460351 they are saying that they are doing like over 4 000 tests but its just very difficult
3460352 but hopefully they can make these olympic games very clean
3460353 okay its pink it has nurses on it what are nurses do you know what nurses are
3460354 yes nurses work in hossa pitals they work with dead people
3460355 thats right they work in hospitals you have a nurse shirt when did you wear it last
3460356 i dont know a couple weeks ago i want to wear it now
3460357 in the heat of the moment everybody can get carried away
3460358 but its important that we respect referees and opponents and its important for us as professionals to give a good example
3460359 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
3460360 its up to the players to show more respect to referees
3460361 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
3460362 its down to us as a group of players and referees to get a consistent base
3460363 its going to be a continuing relationship with referees we are looking to move it forward and i think we can its down to me to take responsibility for my team mates before they get that booking
3460364 i think the idea is terrific its designed to cut out excesses and thats what we are trying to do
3460365 everybody is signed up to make it work and it will be great if it does
3460366 the putts that payne made on 16 and 18 showed what a great champion he is
3460367 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3460368 and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
3460369 you dont always have the performances that live up to the billing
3460370 id love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep
3460371 but everythings got to fall right the europeans arent going to roll over for us and let us win we have to go out there and earn it
3460372 life is like a video game for always trying to get the high score
3460373 what ive found is that its extraordinarily rewarding to have something other than throwing
3460374 its alleviated a lot of the stress and concern about the future
3460375 there are about 350 in each class and im pretty sure most of them know what i do now
3460376 every time ive been in the olympics ive had relatively mediocre days
3460377 my goal for this year isnt to get a medal but to execute the way i should execute if i do that and throw well ill be satisfied
3460378 to become part of that fraternity or sorority of olympic champions its unbelievable
3460379 it doesnt matter what you do the rest of our life everyones gonna remember that you are an olympic champion
3460380 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3460381 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3460382 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3460383 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3460384 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3460385 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3460386 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3460387 gentlemen is fraught with the psychological warfare bedroom drama catholic guilt reprehensible deception and shame that coincide with relationships gone seriously wrong greg dullis liquor cabinet confessions are chased with some of the blackest sounding rock ever committed to tape by a white band hopped up on primal energy the mesmerizing r amp b funk slide blues garage and chamber pop strains are tied to a come hither soulfulness perfumed with hyssop and stained with nicotine
3460388 my sister was actually a foundling from the other clan and were about to execute her real brother
3460389 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3460390 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3460391 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3460392 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3460393 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
3460394 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it she said
3460395 look ill give you whatever support you need including staying completely away from you
3460396 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3460397 right now in human beings it kills 55 percent of the people it infects
3460398 that makes it the most lethal flu we know of that has ever been on planet earth affecting human beings
3460399 im sorry if im making people a little frightened but i feel its my role
3460400 you dont always have the performances that live up to the billing
3460401 id love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep
3460402 but everythings got to fall right the europeans arent going to roll over for us and let us win we have to go out there and earn it

3460411 through a fractious primary season there were a lot of hurt feelings

3460425 we have shown that with the use of current advanced high strength steels a vehicles body structure mass can be reduced by at least 25 percent
3460426 however with the new third generation steels now under development we expect to achieve more than 35 percent in structural mass reduction which will significantly help automakers improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
3460427 during the production stage of a vehicle a low density material such as aluminum will emit significantly more greenhouse gas emissions to the environment than steel

3460443 and people who work on the move and want to work when they are travelling just as well as they might from their desks their home offices or on the road
3460444 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them
3460445 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
3460446 i lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs there was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air
3460447 im eating a lot of pasta and pizza im eating a lot of carbs
3460448 i think just about every morning ive woken up at 4 30 or 5 it takes me a while to fall back asleep but i do for about an extra half hour it takes me a while to get up but its the olympics its what you have to do
3460449 we all have a platform its a matter of how we use it
3460450 were asking coaches to use their platform to help children
3460451 i cant tell you what that means to a child
3460452 but you have to put a face to the problem so people understand
3460453 basketball and sneakers you need sneakers to play its the perfect way to call attention to this
3460454 she pointed to a statue of mary and put her hands together
3460455 she wanted me to pray with her she clung to my neck in that church it wasnt that she loved me she just didnt want to let me go
3460456 wed give out 300 pairs of shoes and 500 more people would be in line youd leave thinking we made them happy for one day but theyre still there
3460457 my moms a surgeon so weve always been pretty well off
3460458 i never expected wed see so many kids who didnt have shoes
3460459 pray for someone to love me thats what he told me
3460460 at 4 years old to know thats missing that just broke my heart
3460461 which is nothing like what wed call a home here
3460462 every single one of us came out of there crying
3460463 wed give out 300 shoes but pack maybe 500 just so we had enough sizes for everyone
3460464 so at the end we would be packing up shoes to save for the next distribution they didnt understand why we werent giving them out and we couldnt communicate mothers would be begging us to give their kids shoes it was awful
3460465 i played at purdue in front of 14 000 people
3460466 were all used to people cheering for us but this didnt even compare these people werent cheering for us because we played basketball they were excited to see us and knew that we were there to help them it was more than shoes it was love and attention
3460467 they werent people i knew so i just didnt pay any attention
3460468 i dont like your feet touching me i dont like to touch your feet
3460469 then i realized when you washed the feet thats when you got to interact with the kids
3460470 you got to talk with them by the end of the first day every single one of us washed feet by the end of the trip we didnt even think about it
3460471 they were so happy and excited i thought if they can survive that ill be fine i have no idea whats going to happen but it will work out
3460472 here if you keep your nose clean if you work hard maybe you get a scholarship
3460473 if you pay your bill you have electricity theres no electricity available to those people and theres no chance most of them can get out its not a choice
3460474 that bench would be a bed no a luxury bed for someone
3460475 man if someone tells me about something they dont have here its a joke
3460476 how can you experience something like this and not be affected
3460477 i took my players completely out of their comfort zone to places they didnt know to do things they didnt understand and they were incredible
3460478 i wish every coach in america could experience this with his players i know there are coaches who win national championships who go to final fours if you told me i had to exchange this experience with my players for a final four id say keep your final four this will stay with me far longer
3460479 i cant think of a day that i havent had at least one box like that arrive
3460480 but now im sitting here trying to figure out how fast i can get these shoes to peru
3460481 unless steps are taken to make sure theaters can survive and prosper either by public subsidies for their creation or zoning that requires they be part of the urban landscape they risk being overwhelmed by other businesses
3460482 its such a great financial bargain that many indie companies are quite content to produce their new work the fringe for a 550 fee instead of seeking out costlier venues at other times
3460483 when a showcase costs 20 000 to 40 000 to mount theres little room for experimentation
3460484 your fathers dead he was shot this morning not far from the house im sorry
3460485 would not be in the best interest of the community
3460486 certainly were opposite but i believe the success of h amp m is that they not only start out on the basis of having to sell a lot of clothes at good prices to a lot of people they also look for new ways of doing things and thats why i respect them this idea of collaborating with something i can identify with
3460487 abortion rights coalition of canada suggested such a law last november in our talking points against c 484
3460488 mps who are truly concerned with womens safety can support bill c 543 those who want to give personhood to the fetus will support bill c 484
3460489 there is also a valid concern by some womens groups that a tougher penalty law be used disproportionately against women
3460490 im pro choice ive always been pro choice one has nothing to do with the other
3460491 the guy who murdered my daughter he admitted that he shot her in the torso to kill the baby to me there needs to be some kind of legislation that addresses that
3460492 presence of short sightedness by parents about the lifetime costs of raising children
3460493 reflects a marxist and socialist viewpoint that people are merely objects to be manipulated for the benefit of the state
3460494 neglects to understand the dynamic benefits of families to society
3460495 it adopts a shortsighted view that women who put their family first are somehow a drain on the economy ignoring the fact that many women bring in an income even as they stay at home with their children
3460496 the unintended consequence of socialist policies is that they cause disincentives for having children
3460497 there are some causes that are worth losing for and in that there is no defeat
3460498 some pro lifers thought kline couldnt win the general so they made sure he didnt couldnt win the primary by sewing up key endorsements prior to kline announcing
3460499 this coupled with abortion cloning and liberal republican money proved too lethal a combination for kline to overcome
3460500 now it is up to howes pro life supporters to hold his feet to the fire to fully prosecute the planned parenthood case something that was never ever in doubt with kline
3460501 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
3460502 china promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled
3460503 i gladly risk my freedoms to speak out for those who have none
3460504 as a young woman i passionately speak out against the pain and suffering that chinese women must face daily through the practice of forced abortion and human trafficking
3460505 they routinely deal with the tragic and painful loss of children through forced abortion and young girls face the horror of being sold into sex slavery through human trafficking my hope is through my witness today i may be a voice for them
3460506 the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics
3460507 we pray that god will bring an end to these human rights abuses by the chinese government and one day the world will see justice liberty and freedom for the beautiful people of this wonderful country

3460528 we really liked the design on the panasonic lumix dmc lx3 which resembles a classic 35mm compact more than it does a toyish point and shoot controls were easy to use and the interface seemed similar to panasonics other products which is perfectly fine
3460529 the lx3s lcd is a thing of beauty it has a 3 2 aspect ratio and a resolution of 460 000 dots when comparing shots with colleagues we found its viewing angle simply exceptional
3460530 the idea here is that a complete novice can pick up the camera and start shooting with the camera optimized for whatever subject theyre shooting theres an awful lot of other clever kit built into the lx3 too not least of which is the new venus engine iv image processor and it is this coupled to that new sensor that helps provide a lot of the finessing for the images once youve shot them
3460531 hopefully were creating a leaner meaner governmment and just only cutting fat
3460532 bottom line the k20d is a great camera for the photo enthusiast and maybe for the pro too the new 14 6 megapixel cmos image sensor combined with a lot of modern technology create a wonderful camera for only 1 129 95 the live view function in body shake reduction capability and improved dust reduction system show that pentax is serious about evolution of the k body line the ability to use any pentax glass means i can even use my 20 year old pentax lenses on the k20d
3460533 the one improvement that feels more like an after thought is live view
3460534 the pentax k20d is an improvement on the already good k10d
3460535 the reviewer really liked the dust notification system which points out where dust spots are on the sensor so they can easily be removed image quality was good however skin tones appeared to be slightly off with a little to much saturation white balance did alright under fluorescent lighting but had a problem eliminating the yellow cast under incandescent lights one last gripe was that when you switch to live view the camera slows way down
3460536 if you need a high resolution camera but dont need a fast frame rate the k20d may just fit the bill
3460537 this cameras stumbling points are its high iso performance and low light auto focus speed the reviewer noted the sensor shift mechanism image stabilization system provided about 4 stops advantage as stated earlier image quality was excellent in fact it captured better detail than most dslrs in its price range
3460538 this is pentaxs first attempt at live view and the result is super slow system and the reviewer suspects its not because it was a preproduction camera but that it is a design problem the slowness could be the kiss of death for sports and action photographers lots of buttons on the camera body gives photographers tons of shooting control but if more features are wanted good luck wading through the cameras long and confusing menu system
3460539 apparently the camera stacks up pretty well in the iso 100 1600 range with the other competitors in the entry level dslr range pentax did however choose to leave out a couple of features that would have been icing on the cake 1 faster burst rate 2 a rear button auto focus option
3460540 this is just fun camera to use but the metering system is unpredictable and disappointing considering a cameras primary function is to accurately expose images the k20d seems to have inherited pentaxs historical underexposure problems considering the level of technology available in todays marketplace this aspect of the camera is really unacceptable
3460541 pre owned vehicles have already gone through the initial period of rapid depreciation

3460548 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3460549 people are somewhat brand loyal but people tend to look for the lower price so at this point another factor in their decision making may be well they have gas and they dont so theyll go there

3460567 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3460568 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself

3460688 its going to be interesting i hope it goes well the good image of the rail runner should help
3460689 im not sure what their motivation is but its real
3460690 people dont like to raise taxes especially in tough economic times but there are a lot of people who cant get enough mass transit
3460691 theres something that warms the heart of a lot of people to see a bus on the street even if they dont use it and its only partially full
3460692 we expect gas will eventually hit 5 or 6 a gallon and when people take that into account and they have the public transportation system thats going to help a lot of them out people will make their decision based on whats going to be best for them
3460693 well be looking wherever we can to get the money for the trains without affecting our other state transportation projects
3460694 i wanted to be the best actor that i could be its just sad for me because i know i worked so hard and i just feel like in some way i kind of blew it its just hard to get away from what i see as the stain of these bad movies
3460695 the first kiss of the movie was out on haight street with like 200 people watching outside
3460696 war in georgia the israeli connection al alam reported more on this plan in arabic the american plan is to create tention in the middle east and the near east similar to this of the balkan warns saudi satellite propaganda tv against broadcasting lies about iran asks al arabiya to withdraw its reporter from iran if the tv continues the hostility houston chronicle criticizes the exhibition of egyptian minister of culture saying if hosny were a cab driver i doubt the museums would thank him for his commitment to getting people to the airport on time as well as making paintings aljazeera palestinian poet mahmud darwish died today in an american hospital at his last years darwish was touring gulf states writing poems for the sheiks in exchange for money darwish played his role cooperating with arafat intelligence to murder palestinian cartoonist transcript says darwish i am angry with you your cartoons and writings makes me angry ali mahmud sure your are angry because i ignored you i always ignore the lowlife people like you darwish i can let them deport you out of london at any minute ali eaten by the wolf
3460697 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
3460698 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3460699 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3460700 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3460701 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3460702 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3460703 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3460704 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3460705 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3460706 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3460707 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3460708 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3460709 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3460710 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3460711 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3460712 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3460713 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3460714 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3460715 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3460716 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3460717 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3460718 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3460719 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3460720 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3460721 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3460722 the custom homepage looks like a regular weblog and it has all the standard features you have come to expect from we have 7 really cool templates designed by brian our creative director to choose from and if you dont like our templates you can build your own just by picking your colors no coding knowledge required you can add your own html snippets to the sidebar for advertising blog roll or anything else you would want to put in there we even allow you to add your google analytics code on the site so not only do you can have a full picture of web traffic with google analytics you also track your podcast statistics with premium statistics that is included in every hosting package
3460723 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3460724 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3460725 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3460726 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3460727 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3460728 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3460729 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3460730 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3460731 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3460732 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3460733 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3460734 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3460735 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3460736 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3460737 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3460738 the line was so long i was like what is this
3460739 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3460740 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3460741 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3460742 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3460743 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3460744 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3460745 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3460746 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3460747 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3460748 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3460749 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3460750 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3460751 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3460752 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3460753 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3460754 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3460755 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3460756 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3460757 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3460758 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3460759 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3460760 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3460761 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3460762 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3460763 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3460764 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3460765 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3460766 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3460767 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3460768 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3460769 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3460770 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3460771 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3460772 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3460773 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3460774 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3460775 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3460776 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3460777 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3460778 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3460779 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3460780 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3460781 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3460782 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3460783 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3460784 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3460785 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3460786 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3460787 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3460788 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on
3460789 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3460790 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3460791 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3460792 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3460793 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3460794 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3460795 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3460796 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3460797 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3460798 umg incurs practically no expenses or risks in connection with the masters particularly with respect to licensing other companies such as
3460799 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3460800 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3460801 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3460802 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3460803 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3460804 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3460805 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3460806 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3460807 ive seen a lot of people struggle with microphone stands in the past and ive seen many musicians trip over them onstage and in the studio i just knew that there had to be a better way
3460808 finally one night i happened to notice that a very famous guitar player was using duct tape to hold his microphone to the front of his speaker cabinet it was then that i realized that something had to be done the next day we went to work
3460809 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3460810 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3460811 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3460812 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3460813 the self help and spirituality market continues to boom in the u s in 2007 it pulled in more than 600 million in u s revenue according to simba information a connecticut based market research firm but only certain american self help books do well in the international market
3460814 its not a universal thing for self help to work abroad
3460815 a lot of these books do find a very big international audience some of it has to do with where authors have advocates or disciples
3460816 it is easier to resist at beginning than at the end
3460817 although not a squeamish person by nature i really do not understand why the concept of personal space is often unfamiliar to a lot of people
3460818 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3460819 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3460820 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3460821 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3460822 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3460823 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3460824 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3460825 als we dan toch worden aangeklaagd kunnen we ze nog wel even pesten
3460826 the good thing about it i played that position late in my career in buffalo but just defense i played just defense my first four years in the league with cincinnati so thats why im familiar with it
3460827 hes seen him do interviews on tv and everything but hes all that everybody says he is i think he is a good young man and i think he is an outstanding player everything hes proven over this past year i mean it speaks for itself we are going to get together and everything i know and some of the things ive learned over my years im going to help him out and try to notate that transition over as far as him taking his game up into another level
3460828 even the first time i came out here to san francisco i was impressed i was impressed with the coaching staff it reminds me of the coaching staff that i had when i first got to buffalo out of free agency out of cincinnati and that really turned me on and then having the chance to talk to the guys mark roman nate clements jonas jennings those guys kind of stayed in my ear throughout time all over the summer time i still didnt know so i was just waiting and seeing what the best opportunity was and the big thing it really wasnt about money for me i wanted to come somewhere where i thought i would have the best opportunity to win because ive been playing for eleven years now so im trying to at least at the minimum get to the playoffs and then we are going to win it all in the super bowl so i felt like san francisco was the best place for me
3460829 im fine im good i wouldnt be here if i wasnt thats a good way to look at it but i got passed the surgery to the fifteenth week of the season i almost made it through but im fine now i was hoping to play the season out but that monday night when minnesota won that kind of put us out of the playoffs so there was really no need for me to go ahead and continue to finish
3460830 its just a matter of time the good thing about this defense is its not loaded with a lot of stuff i came from philly to where it was serious it was a lot of stuff but the good thing is its basic you are going to have a couple of calls but it is more so terminology for me the best part about it is ive been in the league now going on eleven years so its not really much i havent seen its really not anything i havent seen now its just finding out what we used to call it and call it that here now
3460831 hes willis actually coming into the same position that i was when i came into cincinnati because i was in that same position
3460832 theres just this play hes got to make and everything
3460833 to me it is important for me to come in and understand what im doing and not only that to understand who im playing with so they get to know me and i get to know them thats what is more important for me than anything and i kind of had this date circled on my calendar but as time goes on nobody likes training camp i dont like training camp but im here
3460834 he will work with the second group as he did today in practice in the game i believe greg manusky will probably limit his calls so that the second group doesnt do a lot of the volume that we have on the defensive package standpoint hell probably just keep it pretty simple so that he can play thats probably it wed like to get him in we dont want to wear him out either because he hasnt been in training camp hes been working out
3460835 we do need depth and special teams for us is an advantage a year ago id like to have seen us win a game because of it although we were very good i dont think we ever pulled that off jeff is an outstanding special teams player too so well have to see how this works the more depth you have at linebacker typically makes for a better special teams group and hopefully this creates a little bit of depth for us so these guys dont get exhausted just playing base
3460836 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3460837 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3460838 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3460839 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3460840 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3460841 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3460842 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3460843 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3460844 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3460845 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3460846 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3460847 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3460848 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3460849 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3460850 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3460851 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3460852 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3460853 across a wide range of problems which had remained intractable for years we have found solutions
3460854 would be used by big and stronger developing countries against smaller and vulnerable
3460855 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3460856 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia
3460857 his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona
3460858 the judge confirmed that ebay acted diligently when it received letters from loreal
3460859 i have been so happy with the team gold that had been my dream now this gold is just the icing on a perfect cake
3460860 both sides are making efforts to reach an agreement somehow
3460861 we discussed overall issues in the north korea japan relationship for a long time including the issue of the abductions
3460862 we discussed on what area we could come to an agreement tonight
3460863 our requirement for moving forward on delisting is a rigorous verification regime and a verification protocol covering nuclear disarmament and until we get there i think weve been clear that delisting cant go forward
3460864 on thursday weak gdp gross domestic product data from germany and the eurozone will highlight the problems of the european economies putting euro dollar again under pressure
3460865 the euros feeble attempt to recover quickly dissipated as the intensification of the conflict between russia and georgia was used as another excuse to sell euros
3460866 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3460867 we scored six goals we created an enormous amount of opportunities which is reassuring what worries me a bit is that they scored two goals
3460868 from the first day the coach has stressed that the match against wisla is like a final the pre season work has been good and we expect to arrive at the match in the best possible condition
3460869 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3460870 we thought it could be a very easy game for us obviously that was a misunderstanding
3460871 we had every chance to win and in the last two minutes i thought we were winning but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3460872 we got behind the 8 ball early we will have to come out focused on our defensive schemes
3460873 we started a little bit relaxed thinking that china wasnt a good opponent for us
3460874 we are the world champions but anyone can beat us
3460875 the final loss does hurt a little bit but it also shows we can play the world champions we can
3460876 this game prepares us for other games in the olympics players can improve quickly
3460877 the way he is attacking this meet he isnt just winning he is destroying world records on the way
3460878 it feels awesome i was actually glad to have made the final for the first time after missing out at sydney and athens so to win the gold is amazing
3460879 it felt like the only people that believed in us was us
3460880 the only rapper that could still get money in the drought
3460881 and i chill with the thugs and the gangsters too i aint a blood but im warring with the boys in blue crooked officer crooked officer why you wanna see me in a coffin sir
3460882 seen you jockin j c cause he got a mercedes and you know about his ladies
3460883 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people
3460884 looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players

3460887 in the 60s when tim leary and i began exploring inner space with psychedelics the music was always a groove that we could follow a route to take us higher music was at the forefront of the expansion of consciousness and the counter culture there was a group consciousness that evolved in some of the performances of the grateful dead jefferson airplane jimi hendrix and others that was transcendent and brought a sense of unity and a feeling of deep love and joy later when i made it to india i was introduced to other music and sounds that vibrate with the cosmos using it to get high the music itself is the high and you just become it like a surfer becoming one with the wave
3460888 not since the late terence mckennas alien dreamtime album in the early 90s has enlightened spirituality flowed so well with contemporary chill out and this time each track is separate a manageable length and broadcast friendly for the most part the music dominates without diminishing the power of ram dass messages without being overly preachy ram dass expressive words give new meaning and interest to this energized yet inspirational musical environment while dj krieces deftly selected grooves bring new life and focus to some universal and timeless spoken truths

3460911 i put down a good final run under the pressure of an olympic final which is the most exciting time to do it and arguably the hardest and then it was just a matter of waiting to see what the last few guys could do
3460912 it was an opportunity that came along to try to do something absolutely incredible so i applied but didnt get in

3460929 listen you cant do that because the five billion creators of this free software will be very angry
3460930 itwire com professionals who work on the basis of billable hours rarely take the time out to write an article for publication unless they have a valid reason for doing so
3460931 the learning curve for linux and freeware is enormous because it involves relearning computing from scratch with software that is not user friendly
3460932 so instead of coming from large reputable companies freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment
3460933 windows is typically bundled with the purchase of a new computer buying it that way really only adds about 75 under bulk licenses to computer makers and that is money that cant really be saved by avoiding windows because computers sold without any os or with linux as an alternative are hard to find and dont sell cheaper
3460934 a linux diy installation like a diy auto repair is extremely complex convoluted time consuming and often dicey
3460935 re installations of windows may restore the desired level of functionality at minimal cost and yet provide more utility for middle aged computers that are not powerful enough for new versions of linux
3460936 open office does not have grammar check and does not have an envelope maker

3460939 contact eric raymond tim oreilly or bruce perrins to solicit support for this going against the objectives of the open source movement owner dougmil doug miller note that i will not be doing this maureen ogara said she was going to call them so it looks better coming from her
3460940 the good news is that legal greed is used to leverage attorneys to represent their clients to the best of their ability or bill a lot of hours trying
3460941 i freely admit that i have little patience for those who come to this forum and complain about problems in open source software that cost them nothing and then want to remain willfully ignorant of basic tools imho users like this have three choices 1 change your attitude and learn 2 pay someone to do it for you or 3 live with what you could download for free
3460942 so for those inclined to try linux for free the break even point is about 15 billable minutes far less time than is needed to actually install it assuming that you find a deal for a computer without a proprietary os
3460943 linux on a desktop pc currently doesnt save money for people with an income of x00 dollar hour
3460944 so for those inclined to try linux for free the break even point is about 15 billable minutes they are absolutely right about this
3460945 there are some things windows is well suited to a law office is one of them
3460946 a lawyer cannot install and configure linux for proper use
3460947 in one case i went into detail about the article and pointed out some of the areas in which it was deficient in reasoning
3460948 so far as i know an article cannot reason at all the articles composer can however an important distinction
3460949 you have to be that pumped if im in their face im showing them that im not scared they can hit anything at me and ill get it back i have that belief you have to give everything and never give up im scary

3460952 we wouldnt have won had i not had the op i might have been 95 per cent but against these two that would not have been enough the ankle felt great that was our best for some time after winning the worlds in 2006 we knew when we wanted to peak again
3460953 porque no tengo miedo y ellos no me van a amedrentar
3460954 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets
3460955 we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
3460956 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
3460957 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
3460958 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
3460959 a one off crackdown is all very well but labour are still failing to enforce the knife laws we already have
3460960 hey owen i use a plug in for mozilla firefox called adblock plus and it does a super job of blocking
3460961 religious discrimination includes failing to reasonably accommodate an employees religious practices where the accommodation does not impose undue hardship
3460962 the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws many democrats believe bans on most guns are common sense and they still support the handgun ban in barack obamas hometown of chicago boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric and they know it
3460963 the partys gun control platform plank puts the lie to everything they say
3460964 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional yet here they are calling for a ban on so called assault weapons even after years of experience tells us that bill clintons ban accomplished nothing and cost the party control of congress in 1994
3460965 even after a study done for the justice department found that gun shows are rarely the source of firearms used by criminals gun shows provide a forum a gathering place for law abiding gun owners to discuss ideas and issues and share constitutionally protected freedoms of speech assembly and the right to keep and bear arms increasingly democrats seem averse to the exercise of these rights by anyone who does not share their philosophy and this is the party of inclusion
3460966 democrats have an opportunity to reject and repudiate this platform
3460967 if they do not that tells american gun owners everything they need to know about democrats as november approaches
3460968 brendon hardly looks a year older than he did back in the first film which was set nearly 20 years earlier and youll see why any geek worth their salt would snort derisively

3460976 over the course of our research we see a wide range of organizational maturity and approaches to corporate learning ranging from companies that make strategic long term investments to those who consider learning as a tactical solution or employee benefit
3460977 the hilo 80 exemplify excellence in governance operations and program execution these companies demonstrate the value of approaching learning as a business strategy
3460978 spending more money does not guarantee that learning will have a positive business impact
3460979 sustained investment coupled with the right practices and processes is far more important than spending more money
3460980 our oceans are under assault from global warming pollution and industrial scale fishing yet nmfs has proposed weakening the one law that protects entire ecosystems

3460991 our experienced investment and operations teams have done a great job of selecting investments and assisting portfolio companies in a great variety of operational improvements as a result the portfolio produces excellent income and we expect significant gains in the future
3460992 although we invested euro 152 million in six transactions this quarter we are being very selective as evidenced by our closing ratio declining from our 5 historical average to about 4 during the second quarter
3460993 in addition to macroeconomic conditions softening the liquidity crisis is also causing the volume of leveraged buyouts in the market to decline and although we have achieved excellent market coverage in our target markets we intend to be extremely selective over the next few quarters
3460994 we are pleased with the credit quality of our portfolio
3460995 our non accrual loans were less than 1 of total loans at fair value as at 30 june 2008 also the average debt to ebitda of the portfolio had declined to 6 1x which is in line with current market leverage levels we have a highly diversified portfolio that will continue to perform well even if the economy falters

3460997 there is a growing need for new behaviors and services that reduce the wear and tear on users without impeding their ability to communicate
3460998 text messaging has become deeply woven into the fabric of our culture in recent years
3460999 we believe there is a need to offer consumers a way to retain the ability to send messages without being disabled by doing so its easier and potentially much less painful to speak messages rather than always typing them
3461000 this disastrous proposal makes about as much sense as eliminating homeland security at airports
3461001 after an increase in influenza related deaths in the second quarter we experienced the typical seasonal slowdown in the third quarter

3461004 delays with the acceptance and introduction of our new boeing 757 and two boeing 767 freighters have impacted our financial results for the second quarter
3461005 despite recent financial and economic trends we remain positive about our business model and our recent investment in the new aircraft

3461009 longer term prospects are underpinned by above target room signings leading brands and a strengthening dollar but we expect weakening revpar trends now evident in the u s to hold back valuation
3461010 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose

3461105 the streets in america are gold or something i used to think every american was a millionaire and everyone owned his own house and had a car and drank coca cola instead of water and had meat for every meal
3461106 this must have been how gannan felt when she first met the yellow haired gi bastard at the nco club
3461107 youre a dungwhore and you catch yourself a gi by getting pregnant with is brat but then he goes off to vietnam and gets himself killed that leaves you with benefits from the great emperor of america but now you have a black brat to feed and its not enough money so now you want another gi husband to start things over maybe a white guy with a higher rank ungh but who would marry a whore with a black kid
3461108 maybe she was trying to scrub the color off and she held his face down in the washbasin too long
3461109 i would learn that women even seemingly devoted mothers will traffic in their children for the mythic promise of america
3461110 if you eat us beef gleaned from cattle more than 30 yrs old youll contract mad cow disease
3461111 we all know 20 years ago this wasnt happening but now its happening now
3461112 not just around our sun and moon anymore everywhere we look
3461113 what is in our water supply and what is in our oxygen supply to do this what is oozing out of our ground
3461114 why not put together something about a subject a lot of us are most passionate about ourselves
3461115 its good to see they believe enough in the project to get started
3461116 were going to clean up a little bit and call it the early phases of construction so people get off our backs
3461117 its good to see they believe enough in the project to get started

3461123 the bomb came down suddenly our windows blew in everyones windows shattered people were screaming and dying others were hiding
3461124 i grabbed our bags and ran i saw gocha lying face down in the rubble
3461125 i dont know which side to blame i dont even know why this has happened
3461126 russia had been close to us for years it will defend us the us and europe wont
3461127 why did saakashvili take on russia with 10 000 soldiers maybe he was thinking somebody would help us but nobody did help us
3461128 he was covered in blood there was no time to find out but he wasnt moving
3461129 alesandra is fantastic i love coming home after she has cleaned
3461130 just a little further anne i promise im bringing you to the best viewing sight youve ever seen
3461131 it was all done as part of a days work much like the way early comic books were made they certainly werent made as art they werent sold as art and they werent thought of as art
3461132 wacky packages just formed an island of subversive underground culture in the surrounding sea of junk
3461133 i didnt know they were that memorable until about 12 years ago with the internet
3461134 before that i didnt think of it as any more important than the other series
3461135 art used to say i like to think of it as drawing twenty dollar bills
3461136 it wasnt like every day a thousand people would mock tide
3461137 anything that happens when youre eight years old can mark you for life just ask sigmund freud
3461138 wackies were a young childs first exposure to subverting adult consumer culture
3461139 thirty five years later that generation has matured into adults who can afford to nostalgically consume a deluxe volume brimming with that subversion yessirree i am proud to have been a worker in the debased basement of the great temple of commerce that is americas popular culture

3461141 dannon established the next generation nutrition grants to help combat the obesity epidemic in our country
3461142 collaborating with local nonprofits that understand the unique challenges faced by each county is key to helping improve communities nutrition and lifestyle choices we are excited to continue our commitment to improve childrens nutrition and support local community organizations through our third annual dannon next generation nutrition grants
3461143 the parents and siblings of the participants in our program were instrumental in encouraging physical activity and healthy eating we found that the health of the whole family was improved by participating in this program they encouraged each other in making healthy lifestyle choices in both exercise and food selection
3461144 based on the results of the programs weve funded family and community involvement makes a difference in the success rate of programs like this
3461145 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3461146 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3461147 better jobs better care new research on the long term care workforce
3461148 the effort was to see what ideas are out there for improving direct care work to make sure people have what they need to stay in their homes and communities
3461149 was interest in taking this class from people in my twitter network mostly grad students at other universities where a course like this is not offered
3461150 the knowledge is free the degree will cost you money
3461151 this very much shows that russia calls the shots in the region
3461152 it shows that when russia wants to throw its weight around it can
3461153 its hard to see how russia will pull out of west ossetia and abkhazia now
3461154 if you give the russians a chance they will take advantage of it they will play their own game and by their own rules
3461155 its a fear of what the west can bring to these countries that prompts russia to act
3461156 russia is scared of the west and its power to project democratic values and liberty
3461157 its in very glaring contrast with what is going on in russia right now
3461158 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3461159 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3461160 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3461161 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3461162 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3461163 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3461164 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3461165 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3461166 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3461167 we dont just veg out and say prayers all day
3461168 in the old days its what one old chaplain would have passed to another old chaplain
3461169 nowadays a lot of it is more formalized comes out of the behavioral sciences
3461170 chaplains are such an integral part of morale and quality of life issues it was an easy fit
3461171 hats off to the army for saying lets find out how folks are doing
3461172 over there hey you were a war hero here people think youve wasted a year of your life your family learned to row the boat without you school is boring and youre on campus with people who might be the same age but arent the same maturity level this is the stuff that will make you crazy
3461173 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3461174 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3461175 im watching attacks against apsny ge and news ge right now
3461176 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
3461177 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position
3461178 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3461179 not too hot not too cold not too wet not too dry
3461180 given that ethanol is continuing to divert an ever larger share of our corn supply away from feed and food even a harvest like the one predicted by usda may not be enough to prevent continued food inflation and to avoid additional harm to family farmers who raise meat and poultry
3461181 i think that under terrible western pressure especially american pressure and i think french president nicolas sarkozy has to also take credit the russians understood that they went too far
3461182 maximum program was to overthrow georgian president mikheil saakashvili and surround tbilisi
3461183 minimum program is to save face so they are saving face now by saying that all goals of the operation have been achieved
3461184 we are not making it a condition for ceasing the current stage of military operations
3461185 but for the personal information of u s leaders our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner and it would be best for him to go
3461186 would have meant an open conflict with the west and russia doesnt need this
3461187 there is no rational reason for russian forces to go to tbilisi
3461188 for what purpose would the russian army go to tbilisi to conquer georgia it is completely obvious that this would be stupid because the georgians are in an anti russian mood
3461189 now it is necessary to implement the cease fire and to draw a quick timetable so that everyone goes back to the positions they held before the conflict
3461190 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3461191 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3461192 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3461193 this is a natural promotion for rick he has been the backbone of wnua for almost 20 years rick knows the station and the music most importantly he knows the listeners and the community this promotion is a win win all the way around
3461194 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3461195 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3461196 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3461197 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3461198 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3461199 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3461200 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3461201 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3461211 under new york state campaign finance laws he can throw as much money at them as he wants
3461212 the fact that hes only endorsing them that hes using his political goodwill as mayor in those areas of new york city means a great deal
3461213 certainly it goes without saying that if youre a popular politician in this era when many arent and you put forward endorsement of candidates people are going to think well if bloomberg thinks this is a good candidate maybe i should vote for him too
3461214 i believe the mayor has done a very good job
3461215 i believe he will have an impact but i believe marty connor will be very successful
3461216 first and foremost make sure the non existent pages return correct header response and are not linked to internally notes from the forum discussion
3461217 the whole point of magazine editorial is to present a cohesive vision
3461218 thats why traditional media is conducive to fashion that is very distinct and holistic new media is now providing a more effective venue for niches subgroups and outliers in fashion to promote their vision
3461219 when you see people on street style sites you may actually have a lot of what theyre wearing in your closet or at least enough so you can go out and buy a top or bag to get the look with your own personal twist
3461220 with glossies its all about brand new things that cost a lot of money styled by a professional on a six foot tall 17 year old a vision thats out of reach for most women its still nice as a fantasy but its getting marginalized into a niche in the marketplace
3461221 the very nature of blogging means that nearly any topic from shiny leggings to fall florals will be picked up bloggers are constantly searching for original content in an increasingly crowded space
3461222 our editors analyze and identify trends from what our users are actually wearing but while fashion magazines are closing their issues three months ahead of time and are ultimately guessing at trends we show you whos wearing them right now

3461228 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3461229 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3461230 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3461231 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3461232 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3461233 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3461234 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3461235 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3461236 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3461237 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3461238 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3461239 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3461240 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3461241 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3461242 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
3461243 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3461244 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend

3461246 asked about his position on same sex marriage a year ago john edwards said that he personally does not support gay marriage citing his religious beliefs as basis for his opposition
3461247 here we are 10 years together two kids together and yet somebody can be married for a month and they can have insurance at their jobs and we cant but its really more than that marriage it is really more about love and family

3461252 they might have adjusted their plans slightly but they are still coming it could have been a lot worse
3461253 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3461254 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3461255 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
3461256 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3461257 how can the state of rhode island claim sovereign immunity
3461258 did not do the prosecution it was private counsel motley rice which handled the prosecution so every lead paint watcher ought to wonder is the state of rhode island extending that privilege of sovereign immunity to private counsel
3461259 in the last five years the main thing has been the misuse of inside information
3461260 people have said when theyve come up before a disciplinary hearing i didnt know i was doing wrong so we are making it mandatory for them to show they understand what the misuse of inside information is
3461261 easily configure an image either mapping it to the entire screen or to an area defined by the user
3461262 any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country throughout the world
3461263 but certainly we have the ability and we have shown that over and over again that we can beat people on technology and applying that technology
3461264 even under harsh drought conditions with minimal amount of water or moisture it will survive
3461265 it think its going to be part of the equation
3461266 in the next four or five years i think well increase not only the fruits per jatropha tree but well also increase the amount of oil in each of those seeds
3461267 there are implications to dedicating more and more crop land to fuel production rather than food production
3461268 that comes in the form of tighter supplies for food production and that leads to higher prices
3461269 we have to have these machines running if we dont have these machines running and we dont have diesel fuel we dont produce our crops
3461270 to be a better america we are going to have to have a secondary source besides oil

3461274 nice clock added to 10 downing i peeked through the window as well and there are papers on a table like someones in there planning something the chairs are up on the tables as i recall it looks pretty close to done i dont know whats preventing them from opening
3461275 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3461276 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you real ly hate to step outside a family environment
3461277 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3461278 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3461279 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3461280 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3461281 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness

3461285 we are very pleased that the gao has upheld the navys source selection decision for the bams uas program
3461286 this reaffirms that northrop grummans offering was selected as the best value determination in a fair and open competition we look forward to getting back to work on this critical program for our navy customer
3461287 putin champions a particular vision of russia and a particular vision of russia in the world that vision is indigenous to himself and to the political culture over which he presides it is a primary fact of the contemporary world not even the presidency of barack obama will rid him of it you see he does not wish to be rid of it

3461292 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3461293 people are somewhat brand loyal but people tend to look for the lower price so at this point another factor in their decision making may be well they have gas and they dont so theyll go there

3461302 bonjour jai re u aujourdhui mon kf700 et je le trouve excellent
3461303 nico38 non les p riph riques ne sont pas offerts
3461304 cest sur quil na pas lair tr s l gant pour un ordi de
3461305 ca confirme il ny a pas de mac en chine
3461306 moi le truc que je me suis toujours demand cest comment on fait pour recharger
3461307 non mais justement il ne fallait pas penser que je reduis simplement lart la
3461308 i think its fair to say that hes still convalescing
3461309 mystiques neural inhibitor is still in his system and its wreaking havoc with his flesh to ice changes and hes still troubled in his mind about some of the decisions hes made recently hes not in a good way when we first meet him in manifest destiny
3461310 at the start of the story hes experiencing some very strange and unsettling symptoms similar to the way he reacted when his power first kicked in
3461311 he talks to beast about this and beast suggests that it may be the toxins mystique used on him still working through his system and doing more and more harm along the way x men origins
3461312 the beast sends a blackbird jet on auto pilot so that bobby can do a coast to coast hop but this turns out to be the start of a long and arduous journey for bobby both in terms of distance and psychologically
3461313 as one of the original five x men hes aware of how much history is tied into the mansion so i think on one level hes very ambivalent about the move
3461314 but hes pretty much focused on his own problems at this stage his own role as an x man his own future with the team and whether this shift from east to west marks the point where he should call it quits
3461315 were using manifest destiny as an opportunity to remind readers of how cool and how extensive icemans powers are
3461316 in that sense its a re definition of the character for the post messiah complex era it also revisits a crucial relationship that will continue to be important for bobby going forward
3461317 hanks dad works for a nuclear power plant and the kidnapping relates to that
3461318 someone wants access to a certain item a prototype that the plant has produced and mr mccoy becomes a pawn in this villains game as does the young hank mccoy
3461319 beast is one of my favorite x men and theres something kind of surreal about that origin as it was told back in the first run of x men
3461320 i always felt that there was something we werent being told about villains the conquistador and i wanted to add in those beats the changes are subtle but they make a big difference by the time you get to the end of the story
3461321 the other fascinating thing about beasts origin is how professor x behaves at the end of it its one of the most awesome and extreme uses of his power in the canon
3461322 for me beast is fascinating and cool because of the crazy contradictions in his nature because hes a genius and an aesthete in the body of an animal
3461323 i always go back in my mind to that moment in grant morrisons run when he holds up his clawed hands and says to jean you knew me when i could play the guitar
3461324 bobby has been less consistently handled over the years but his story like sam guthries in a lot of ways has been the story of the apprentice who becomes a journeyman and then a master weve seen him mature and grow into his power and thats a very compelling process to watch
3461325 i think of them differently because theyre among my favorite x men along with rogue cyclops and cannonball
3461326 its not because they were in there from the start angel was too and i can honestly say that i dont feel such a strong connection to angel
3461327 but the fact that theyve got 50 years of history behind them makes you very careful about how you handle them
3461328 the fact that hes doing excellent with minimal services and so quickly means we dont want to miss the opportunity to give him ibi hes showing a lot of hope and we know he can reach his potential with it
3461329 down the road i see bankruptcy or well have to be really good at budgeting which we already are
3461330 as a parent you do whatever you have to for your children
3461331 our original permit was filed under the rules existing at the time
3461332 its confusing when the federal appeals court vacated the rules it requires a hearing on hazardous air pollutants
3461333 our proposal is more stringent than the federal rules we are using maximum achievable control technology were testing our program at another plant in east texas to inject carbon and mercury into the ground
3461334 politics is really about two things passion and love of country
3461335 as the editor of heading right and through alan levy s groundbreaking 21st century ultimate in free speech model im excited and honored to build the bridge between right leaning icons leaders and policy makers with real main street americans
3461336 we are excited for the roll out of the heading left station and channel we have added a number of outstanding hosts over the past few months and have had many excellent guests including authors personalities strategists congressional officials as well as representatives
3461337 we look forward to continuing to grow the channel and get more interesting guests as heading left gains more exposure over the coming months
3461338 but we decide which is right and which is an illusion

3461340 we are leaving the cis for good and propose that other countries leave this body run by russia
3461341 this is about killing the freedom and independence of this country and scaring all the others around us
3461342 well i think our message to them is no matter what they do no matter how much they bomb us no matter how they want to cripple us and undermine us we are not going to give up our freedom and georgia will never surrender
3461343 our six offices and more than 50 staff in georgia already work for an existing beneficiary population of some 275 000 previously displaced people refugees stateless people and returnees unfortunately that number is now climbing
3461344 the president of russia and the president of france support the following principles of settlement of conflict and urge the two sides to put their signatures to those principles which are as follows first the non use of force second the cessation of all hostilities third free access for humanitarian aid
3461345 i would absolutely think that any parent who would comment on a blog without their kids permission is looking for serious trouble
3461346 if somebody else is in the picture unless they say its ok to use them take them out of it or shadow them a little bit
3461347 find a friend wholl look over your shoulder someone with more restraint
3461348 most of the time when theyre bored theyre aimless and when theyre aimless thats when everybody gets in trouble
3461349 lately ive been really interested in fashion and i like to make binders and slideshows of high fashion modeling and designs
3461350 i just kind of wanted to document my outfits and it was just a random thing that wasnt in relation to anything
3461351 parents have no idea what their kids are doing online
3461352 i share a lot of information to people i guess more than i probably should but i just felt that i didnt want the people who are very close to me reading it because i guess im embarrassed about my writing sometimes
3461353 i believe its a great outlet if youre older and more mature but you are opening yourself up to the world and you have to be prepared for that
3461354 i personally feel that its not safe to have a child whos 12 or 13 have a blog and i wouldnt want my kids to do that
3461355 are you posing in a more provocative way is it how you want to be remembered when your next boyfriend sees it or your future mother in law sees it or your tuition scholarship persons going to review you for dartmouth
3461356 i felt like i had to protect the identity of people who dont know or arent aware of the blog
3461357 i may have known but to me it was a kind of a non thing to know
3461358 i didnt look at it i wasnt terribly interested in seeing it
3461359 anyone who actually believes she is 12 is an absolute idoit sic
3461360 she slept in the bed with us that night to get back to sleep
3461361 she woke up and again woke us up and said and this is really heartbreaking i just woke up crying and i dont even know why im crying
3461362 whoever may comment and whatever feedback you may get girls are very impressionable especially girls in this age that were talking about
3461363 i have a lot of confidence in her and in most kids if not all kids that they can figure it out if they have good guidance and caring people working with them
3461364 id much rather have her decide to stop if shes going to stop than to tell her to stop
3461365 it would have been fine with me if she didnt pick it back up again but i think it was healthy that she did i think it would have been a bad thing for this to be the reason to stop blogging shell grow out of it maybe maybe not
3461366 a way for users to put information back into the web
3461367 hey we are the bomb and you need to manage us
3461368 madalyn not only gives me marketing strategies during our consultations but she gets me thinking in a whole new direction
3461369 madalyn s high energy can do attitude was the shot that i needed to get me going
3461370 madalyn has played a key role in helping me build a strong foundation for my music business
3461371 they approached me and told me that i could not board my flight because they wanted to interview me i was surprised because i thought they would interview me in labasa
3461372 basically the only thing i am upset about is being being stopped at the last minute no one had informed me before i told the officers to let me go but they said they had special orders from the cid office to stop me from leaving its not like i am running away or flying out of the country and they could have easily interviewed me in labasa or i would have gone to the police station myself
3461373 i dont feel threatened in any way but i stand by what i said
3461374 they asked me everything they wanted to know i thought it was something urgent but it was just normal questions about what i said i was treated with respect like any other citizen
3461375 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3461376 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3461377 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3461378 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3461379 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3461380 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3461381 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3461382 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3461383 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3461384 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3461385 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3461386 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3461387 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3461388 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

3461396 thats a lot to ask when service members have much more important things on their minds such as staying alive
3461397 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3461398 i believe these accusations are false we as a family are looking forward to the day all of these charges are dropped and his name is cleared
3461399 we still have some concerns that it may cannibalize our dvd business whats paramount in our mind is protecting our overall margins and we certainly dont want to be overly aggressive until were sure that any move like that is going to be margin accretive
3461400 we think that since we havent seen cannibalization on sell through that its going to increase margins and profitability going to day and date
3461401 titanic was once in a lifetime and i dont think well ever have another gross like that in the history of the industry
3461402 just one of the many benefits of having nbc as part of the ge portfolio
3461403 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3461404 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3461405 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3461406 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3461407 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3461408 bs detection does work for non hard science subjects i lost track of how many of my history exams

3461430 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3461431 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3461432 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3461433 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3461434 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3461435 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3461436 not only goes against common sense but runs counter to the experience of americans at the grocery checkout counter
3461437 i think the whole question is how does everything function
3461438 in todays day and age things have to be run professionally and unfortunately thats not how things are done
3461439 the trust is a lifesaver for a lot of athletes who are not getting any help
3461440 i sincerely hope this win will change the face of olympic sport in india
3461441 in our country olympic sports are not really a priority i hope now they will get more attention
3461442 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3461443 it is not easy for an indian to win an olympic medal let alone a gold because there is no sporting culture in our country i hope this will make sports a way of life in india

3461445 during 35 years of my life i happened to be a refugee twice first after i finished school and now again a war repeated and it is again not for our gain
3461446 i cant say that we hate the russians though the politicians are guilty in everything
3461447 we have been bombed by the planes we went by cars tractors we walked 10 kilometres six miles through the mountains they were bombarding us on our way
3461448 some old people stayed in the village we dont know if they are alive one old woman was burned alive in her house by ossetians and russians
3461449 the politicians are guilty in everything both ours and ossetians
3461450 we lived together with russians before and will live with them in the future
3461451 it was impossible to stay in gori on tuesday because of the bombing a hospital was destroyed by a bomb 400 metres 120 metres from my house as well as an institute

3461456 i was face down like a jellyfish and could see the bottom in three feet of water i knew i was paralyzed i couldnt stand up i held my breath because i knew the lifeguard was right in front of me then i went black
3461457 then everything went full technicolor like a disney movie and i could see everything including the chaos and all the people gathered around me
3461458 i started screaming for my wife tammy who i then saw because she had come down from the condo it then occurred to me that i had to concentrate on the lifeguard to stay alive
3461459 it was painful which i told myself was actually good
3461460 i took my left foot to knock my right heel off the board
3461461 they brought me back and kept me stable the ocean city emts also put a neck brace on me because it was a neck injury they then loaded me on an atv which took me across the beach local firemen then took the body board over a giant sand dune to an ambulance

3461522 you may not decide to give me something for example a book and then grab money from me to pay for it even if i have nothing better to spend the money on
3461523 one cannot whatever ones purposes just act so as to give people benefits and then demand or seize payment nor can a group of persons do this
3461524 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3461525 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3461526 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3461527 medical blogs have the opportunity to be such a benefit to patients
3461528 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients
3461529 its time for us to take some responsibility and really think of how we can maintain the integrity of this process
3461530 included sufficient information for patients to identify their doctors or themselves
3461531 like everything else on the internet its just kind of the wild west
3461532 its very levelling you can write in print what you would never say to a surgeons face about him being an overweening jerk
3461533 not to place an emergency call to the doctor if they had just had sex and had a creamy discharge but no pain or bleeding afterward
3461534 it is semen you rocket scientist and we really did not need to know that
3461535 to hear about the effluent from your nether regions after your feel good friday night
3461536 it really gives a glimpse behind the medical curtain that otherwise the general public wouldnt see
3461537 some of the opinions are very raw and in some cases dont reflect on the profession in a very positive way but they do reflect reality we often say what people dont like to hear
3461538 workers of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chains

3461545 we are looking for a vehicle that operates from a fuel source that reduces or eliminates our dependence on petroleum products that is good for the environment good for our customers and good for the postal service
3461546 the postal service has been an invaluable partner and they put our fuel cell vehicles through some tough daily workouts
3461547 we are gaining valuable insight on how these vehicles perform in demanding real world situations by participating in project driveway the postal service also is demonstrating the need to develop a hydrogen infrastructure to support fueling these vehicles
3461548 we also want to explore other options such as hybrid electric plug in hybrid and other green vehicles that will help us continue to provide our customers with reliable service while protecting the environment
3461549 it shows in no uncertain terms that the republican party considers this a very competitive race worth devoting resources time and energy into
3461550 murphy is a one term congressman and by no means is it a safe seat it usually takes two elections to get the advantage of incumbency
3461551 that could follow into the congressional races and help cappiello
3461552 the effects of the reagan democrats could definitely be a factor
3461553 cares more about raising money from political allies than he does about the families of the 5th district
3461554 cappiellos reliance on raising money from the bush administration may help fill his bank account but it shows how out of step he is with the damage this administration has done to the people he claims to want to represent
3461555 chris is making this campaign about listening to the people of the 5th district
3461556 its a competitive district and cappiello is a candidate who is capable of winning
3461557 we are certainly keeping a very close eye on this race
3461558 for me this particular visit is less about fundraising and more about knowing that there are people both in the district and in washington that believe i have a good shot at winning this race
3461559 the real story is that im getting a great response from the people i meet in the district and thats resonating in chris healy chairman of the state republican party said its an honor and a tribute to have boehner visit

3461589 it wont take 10 years to do it we can get that oil much sooner
3461590 we want to see the lights on the cameras on and the speaker in the chair we want an open debate and open votes on the american energy act
3461591 energy is the most pressing issue today and house republicans overwhelmingly support drilling refining expanding nuclear energy and an all of the above approach and now the speaker is starting to realize its a big issue too
3461592 this is not about the republican team versus the democrat team lets get an energy package on the house floor and worry about the american people for a change its clear to me we need energy independence and today we have an opportunity to make it happen the votes exist today to pass a comprehensive energy bill and we shouldnt miss the opportunity this is not about politics its about whats good for the american people
3461593 back home school is starting back today i was recently talking to a local school official who said that the cost to fuel a school bus has now doubled the school district now has to make the terrible choice of raising taxes or cutting other parts of the school budget like for textbooks the cost of energy is affecting every part of our daily lives theres no silver bullet solution but by combining the solutions of the all of the above strategy we will become less reliant on foreign oil

3461605 while it may be politically helpful to claim the case was an effort to keep tabs on every childs sexual activity such claims simply arent true the opinion by kline was issued to ensure that cases of suspected child abuse get investigated as they should
3461606 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

3461610 es incre ble porque cuando en un partido uno sabe que tiene que luchar contra el rival y contra un p blico que le va a favor bueno uno va pero ya si uno tiene que luchar tambi n contra los rbitros que se supone que tienen que tener pasividad durante el juego entonces la cosa se complica m s
3461611 luchamos hasta el final quer amos ganar este partido no pudimos pero todav a quedan tres partidos m s vamos a ver que ocurre a por ellos
3461612 si ellos nos ganan el partido jugando mejor que nosotros pues est bien nada a reclamar pero as qued demostrado claramente que les han regalado el partido
3461613 desde el inicio les hab an regalado muchos puntos en cinco sets as se hace un poco complicado en el quinto set llev bamos ventaja de tres puntos y si la hubi semos mantenido probablemente podr amos haber ganado el partido eso me deja un poco mal
3461614 influy un poco la ansiedad pero no supimos aprovechar la ventaja aunque eso se se suma a que los rbitros le hicieron un buen trabajo porque claramente se vio que estaban a favor de china por ser local

3461621 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3461622 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3461623 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3461624 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty

3461650 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

3461675 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3461676 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3461677 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3461678 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3461679 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3461680 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3461681 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3461682 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3461683 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3461684 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today
3461685 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3461686 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3461687 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3461688 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3461689 the community cant place their full confidence in that kind of inquiry

3461697 in general we have a family policy against leaving our children alone with men
3461698 background checks give me very little reassurance theres always a first offense and small children are easy prey the stigma about male childcare workers is not just a stigma its a statistic a child is nearly nineteen times more likely to be molested by a male than by a female we find it easier to make a blanket policy and weed out 95 of our chances for problems

3461783 this exciting new version is as ideal for the novice as it is for the power user who wants to produce compelling imagery in todays fast paced environments
3461784 it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player any more
3461785 a lot of the players when i first walked into the dressing room are no longer around and i have 43 test caps so it is time to step up and deliver
3461786 it looks like i might get an opportunity now at number three and it is up to me to take that opportunity
3461787 certainly i have been up and down the order throughout my test match career but more recently i have settled at five
3461788 that is where i have put in my best performances but as a player you always want to test yourself and be as good as you possibly can be
3461789 you look at the best players in the world and a lot of them bat at number three or number four
3461790 people might say that batting at number five is easier than three but you want to test yourself as much as you can and batting at number three you do that
3461791 you could be in after the first ball or three hours later
3461792 that challenges your skills as a batsman and that is what i want to face up to
3461793 i know i can do it i have done it a little bit in the ashes but i have to start converting those fifties into hundreds like i did at lords against south africa
3461794 if i can do it more consistently i will know i am going in the right direction and hopefully the best years of my batting are still ahead of me
3461795 being 26 now i have got experience behind me and i know a bit more about test cricket
3461796 anyone that looks into the dressing room and sees the talent inside it would believe it is possible we can win the ashes there is a lot of ability
3461797 like kp said if we play like we did at the oval and at times this summer we can do it
3461798 the important thing in the lead up to 2005 was that we were winning test matches regularly it became a habit and we played consistent cricket
3461799 as we showed against south africa we scored 600 in the first test and then 200 in the next
3461800 when you play the best team in the world you cannot afford that kind of inconsistency in your game
3461801 it will not be until the winter when see him develop a bit more but i guess the thing i saw from kev this week i know he is a big admirer of michael vaughan and the way he captained the side was that his captaincy style is going to be very similar to the way he plays cricket
3461802 like his batting he will trust himself to make the right call at the right time
3461803 it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player any more

3461810 you could be in after the first ball or three hours later
3461811 that challenges your skills as a batsman and that is what i want to face up to

3461852 ucap ibunya dari kejauhan dengan sedih melepas kepergian anaknya itu
3461853 assalamualaikum yaa akhi ali ini ana akhi abdul rozak bin abdul munnawar cucumu datang untuk bertani membantu
3461854 waalaikumussalam wah cucu paman yang paman sayangi sudah datang ayo cepat sini bantu pamanmu ini
3461855 cucuku al fakir sungguh allah telah memberikan kita rejeki kesehatan dan kekuatan di pagi hari ini jadi bersemangatlah
3461856 assalamualaikum yaa saudaraku dalam islam ada apa gerangan kau bermuram durja apakah kau lagi dalam masalah
3461857 waalaikumussalam ah kau al fakir tak apa apa ini bukan masalahmu
3461858 jangan begitu benar ini mungkin bukan masalahku tetapi alangkah baiknya jika aku dapat membantumu karena kamu adalah saudaraku dalam islam tak ingin jiwa melihat belahan jiwanya yang lain bersedih tangan hampa terus berpangku rasa ingin membantu ada terusik di hati
3461859 baiklah al fakir sebenarnya kau masih terlalu muda akan hal ini tapi jika kau benar ingin membantu maka dengarkanlah apa yang akan aku katakan ini
3461860 tadi subuh seusai sholat aku berencana pergi untuk pulang ke rumahku
3461861 aku suka kamu karena kau cantik dan hatikupun merasa senang bila melihatmu tak ingin rasa tertipu oleh mata gelisah gundah dan bahagia menyelimuti kalbu tanpa kepastian dan angan yang memfanakan maka dari itu akupun ingin segera mengkhitbahmu agar hati ini bisa bahagia angan menjadi nyata dan rasa ini tak menjadi dosa serta diri bisa menjadi lebih bertakwa kepadanya
3461862 baik jika benar begitu mungkin aku akan memikirkannya tetapi setelah kau dapat menjawab pertannyannku ini
3461863 jika kau benar benar mencintaiku menurutmu apa itu cinta sejati dan cinta apa yang kau harap dariku jika aku menerimamu
3461864 cinta sejati adalah suatu rasa untuk mencintai seumur hidup tanpa keinginan tuk berpaling hati dengan yang lain dan untuk cinta yang kuharap mungkin adalah belaian lembut kasihmu untukku
3461865 maaf mungkin aku tak bisa mencintaimu aku rasa kita tak cocok
3461866 wahai engkau akhwat yang berhati lembut aku tak mengerti apa maksudmu aku sungguh benar benar ingin mencintaimu sepenuh hatiku tapi tapi kenapa jawabanku tadi tidak menembus kerajaan hatimu yang suci tolong jelaskan padaku agar aku tak berputus asa dan kecewa akan semua ini
3461867 wahai engkau manusia yang memiliki rasa jika kamu sungguh sungguh ingin mencintaiku maka aku akan berikan kamu kesempatan sekali lagi hari ini pada saat matahari sepenggalan naik tunggulah aku di depan mesjid di daerah ini disana aku akan datang menemuimu tolong pikirkan lagi apa itu cinta sejati yang sebenarnya dan cinta apa yang kau harap dariku dengan ijin allah jika cintamu itu tulus dan suci maka niscaya kamu akan mengerti pertanyaanku tadi tetapi jika kau tidak tahu juga maka ini bukanlah takdirku untuk berjodoh denganmu dan disana aku akan mengatakan maksud jawaban dari pertanyaanku tadi
3461868 kalau begitu jawabmu maka ambil saja ini dan coba kau sabitkan pisau ini kewajahnya jika kau benar benar mengerti hai abu misbah yang berakal jika pisau ini mengenainya lalu merobek wajahnya apakah kau masih menyukai dia mencintai dia seperti kata katamu tadi dan apakah ia masih bisa dikatakan cantik padahal wajahnya telah tersayat oleh pisau ini katakan padaku sekarang abu misbah apa jawabanmu mengenai hal yang ku sebutkan tadi
3461869 a al fakir yaa aku mengerti sekarang mungkin aku tak akan bisa mencintainya lagi
3461870 lalu apa itu yang dinamakan cinta sejati bukankah kau tadi ada berucap cinta sejati tak akan berpaling hati ke yang lain bagaimana dengan jawabanmu tadi coba kau renungkan jika itu saja sudah membuatmu berpaling darinya bagaimana nanti jikalau ia sudah tua ketika allah mulai mencabut kecantikan dia melalui keriput diwajahnya
3461871 dan satu hal lagi abu misbah apakah cinta itu yang kau inginkan darinya melihat hanya dari luar saja hanya dari fisiknya coba pikirkan lagi kurasa karena jawabanmu tadi itu juga yang membuat dia tak ingin menerimamu
3461872 ketenangan hatimu ingat sesuatu yang tergesa gesa itu tidak baik karena ia datang dari setan jadi bersikaplah tenang menghadapinya sambil mengucapkan bismillah agar ini semua diridhai oleh allah
3461873 ya sama sama biar kutemani kamu agar kamu ada muhrimnya juga
3461874 mm yaa setelah kupikirkan lagi secara baik baik alhamdullialh aku mendapatkan jawabannya dari semua itu
3461875 jadi kau sudah tau jawabannya kalau begitu katakanlah padaku apa yang kau maksud dengan cinta sejati dan apa yang kau harap dariku jika aku menerimamu nanti
3461876 pertama aku minta maaf karena tadi aku masih belum mengerti cinta yang kamu maksudkan itu jiwaku masih terbang ke langit dan lupa tuk berpijak di bumi rasaku masih melayang dengan kefanaan dan lupa kan hakekat cinta yang sebenarnya dan inginku mengkhitbahmu masih berupa nafsu bukan karena iman dan taqwa di diri maaf untuk segala hal tadi
3461877 dengan nama allah yang menciptakanku dan memberiku nimat iman dan islam ini sungguh duhai engkau akhwat yang berjiwa lembut aku benar benar mencintaimu dari hati terdalam tanpa ingin melukai perasaanmu tetapi aku lupa bahwa cinta datangnya dari illahi harus dimengerti dan dipahami apa cinta yang sejati itu dan
3461878 dan ijinkanlah aku untuk menjawab pertanyaanmu itu menurutku sebagaimana cinta itu tercipta ia diciptakan dari allah yang maha kuasa oleh karenanya cinta itu sendiri tak boleh dikhianati oleh pandangan kita terhadap keindahan dunia semata melupakan hakekat sang pencipta yang memberikannya untuk kita karena itu pula bila kita mencintai sesuatu maka cinta itu haruslah bersandarkan pada cinta kita yang utama kepada allah atau lebih jelasnya mencintai sesuatu karena allah kita cinta karena allah juga mencintai hal tersebut dan kita benci karena allah membenci hal tersebut
3461879 jadi cinta sejati adalah mencintai sesuatu karena allah bukan karena pandangan zohir belaka yang berupa nafsu tuk menjadikan kita hina kelak dan akupun ingin mengatakan ini padamu wani
3461880 aisyah namaku siti aisyah nur fatimah sudah jangan panggil aku terus dengan nama akhwat aku cemburu dengan nama itu karena teman disebelahku juga seorang akhwat hehe
3461881 ah iya maaf jujur aisyah setelah kupikirkan lagi tentang dirimu aisyah aku terpesona denganmu dengan anugrah allah yang memberimu keindahan fisik tetapi entah kenapa ternyata sekarang aku tak lagi mencintai keindahanmu itu
3461882 kenapa kenapa kau tak mencintaiku lagi bu bukankah tadi kau mencintaiku
3461883 yaa itu dulu aisyah sekarang ijinkan aku mengatakan satu hal ini untukmu dari hatiku terdalam dan allah yang kan menjadi saksi semua ini ada yang lebih mempesonakan diriku aisyah
3461884 siapa dia apakah temanku disebelah ini atau apakah kau tadi bertemu dengan akhwat yang lain
3461885 aisyah kamu tahu sebenarnya selama aku bertemu denganmu aku tidak pernah sedikitpun melihat kau memalingkan wajahmu untuk menatap langsung padaku matamu hanya melihat sekali saja dan kau pun langsung menjauh waktu aku dekati dan memanggil teman muhrimmu untuk dapat berbicara denganku dan kamu tahu aisyah hal itulah hal itulah yang menyebabkan aku berpaling dari rasa cintaku yang dulu ternyata kecantikan hatimu tuk menjaga kesucianmu dan kemuliaan dirimu sangat mempesona diriku mengalahkan pesona kecantikan luarmu karena itulah ijinkan aku mengatakan ini aisyah sekaligus untuk menjawab pertanyaanmu yang kedua aku mencintaimu karena kesholehahanmu aisyah yaa karena kesholehahanmu segala prilakumu tadi kepadaku karena kau lebih mencintai allah daripadaku dan takut kepadanya sungguh hal itulah yang sangat membuatku jatuh hati padamu cinta itulah yang kuharap darimu untukku dengan itu engkau dapat membuatku bahagia aisyah menegurku jika aku lalai mengerjakan perintahnya menyemangatiku untuk selalu rajin beribadah padanya dan menjadi istri yang sholehah yang dapat menjaga rahasia keluarga dan harta benda kita
3461886 untuk apa lagi yaa untuk mengkhitbahku dong kan kutunjukkan kau kepada orang tuaku dan jangan berpura pura yaa
3461887 alhamdullilah ini semua berkat allah juga dan syukron jiddan al fakir atas semuanya bagaimana aku dapat membalasnya kepadamu
3461888 tidak usah kita kan saudara aku tak ingin menolongmu karena mengharapkan imbalan aku hanya ingin balasan darinya saja
3461889 subhanallah maha suci allah yang menciptakanmu al fakir walau masih muda tetapi kamu benar benar memiliki hati yang mulia dan berjiwa suci
3461890 alhamdullilah ini semua karena rahmat dan karunianya jugalah saudaraku sehingga aku dapat menjadi seperti ini
3461891 oh ya nanti kuharap kau dapat datang ke acara pernikahanku yaa disana aku ingin kau untuk menjadi saksi dalam pernikahanku nanti
3461892 saudara mudaku lebih baik jangan di pasar sekarang ini lagi ada banyak pembunuhan dan pencurian terjadi disana kamu tau barbusa si tangan setan lolos dan telah kabur dari penjara beberapa hari yang lalu
3461893 al fakir aku ada ide lebih baik kamu datang saja kerumahku disana kamu bisa minta makanan apa saja ayo tidak apa apa ini adalah hadiah dariku terimalah ini
3461894 syukron abu misbah tapi afwan tidak apa apa aku akan pergi ke pasar saja
3461895 ia sudah kuputuskan aku yakin allah pasti akan melindungku insyaallah tidak apa apa
3461896 baiklah jika itu memang pilihanmu tapi tolong berhati hatilah disana jangan biarkan matamu lengah di pasar nanti

3461979 the expenditures that were undertaken in this case were perfectly permissible expenditures out of the officeholder account
3461980 in this particular case a research firm was hired and research was conducted on issues affecting the councilmans district relating to education and the school board unfortunately individuals who were in charge of overseeing the committees expenditures should have raised a flag that this should have been paid out a campaign account
3461981 the issue here is again a technical violation that frankly the committees treasurer didnt properly send a notification to the city ethics commission at the time that that should have been done

3461995 a discuss o da reforma acontece h mais de uma d cada insustent vel e dif cil de entender a burocracia do sistema brasileiro esse debate com certeza evidenciou e fortalceu a necessidade de aprova o do projeto de reforma
3461996 sou obstinado no que fa o e por isso n s vamos fazer essa reforma tribut ria com cuidado para n o haver queda de receitas a grande carga tribut ria vem sempre em cima de quem paga
3461997 contudo a reforma vai atr s de quem n o paga e redistribui os valores pois com todos pagando ser poss vel reduzir os impostos
3461998 ela n o uma super reforma uma reforma grande importante mas n o temos a pretens o de resolver todos os problemas tribut rios a inten o fazer o que o plano real fez em 1994 criar uma base s lida
3461999 na concep o ideal cada um tem sua opini o cada um quer tributar algo diferente quer dar uma sugest o se eu for acrescentar tudo na reforma ela n o sai estamos fazendo portanto uma reforma poss vel que vai criar uma base importante para ajudar o pa s a continuar se desenvolvendo
3462000 essa proposta de transi o e isso interessante pois nada imediato outra caracter stica importante ser a universaliza o da partilha dos tributos que traz um novo paradigma

3462004 i would posit that obamas camp is figuring he will get so much press here over the week of the dnc that he would do better to stay away for a while and attend to other states
3462005 on the other hand mccain is trying to gain momentum in a state that he desperately needs to win in november and he knows that he will basically be off the air for a week during the dnc now will that stand up through the convention and its concomitant press coverage we shall see
3462006 while barack obama has only stopped in colorado on occasion to speak to small groups of invited elite democrats john mccain has held an open town hall meeting in denver in order to hear concerns from residents in addition to his other campaign stops
3462007 there is no question that colorado is a battleground state and we expect this to be a very tight race and were taking nothing for granted
3462008 thats why we have devoted serious resources to colorado this campaign is taking colorado very seriously and were committed to talking to voters in every corner to the state in terms of the senators travel we can expect to see senator obama talking to voters and fighting hard here in colorado from now until election day

3462033 you need to record something like this because its not everyday you find something that looks like this running around out in the middle of the county

3462041 thanks so much i have actually used the integral lenses already asked meeting participants to reflect on an issue from all these perspectives before they came to the meeting so we had a more rounded discussion i think we may also use this more broadly across the team as we start to focus on leadership for sustainability

3462059 of special relevance to the courts present inquiry congress included in the fisa bill a declaration that the fisa regime together with the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 were to be the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance for national security purposes could be conducted
3462060 the court is charged with determining whether fisa preempts or displaces not a common law set of rules for conducting foreign intelligence surveillance but rather a privilege asserted by the government to avoid public and judicial scrutiny of its activities related to national security
3462061 this imperfect overlap between the preempting statute and the common law rule being preempted does not however create serious problems with finding the state secrets privilege preempted or displaced by fisa in the context of matters within fisas purview
3462062 the legislative history moreover buttresses the courts reading of the statutory text as intending that fisa replace judge made federal common law rules
3462063 defendants advance essentially three points in support of their contention that nothing in fisa indicates any intention by congress to abrogate the state secrets privilege in the case of intelligence driven electronic surveillance
3462064 this hardly counts as authority that the presidents duties under article ii create a shield against disclosure
3462065 fisa makes little provision for notice to surveilled individuals except when the government chooses to disclose surveillance materials and the provisions that exist are easy for the government to avoid
3462066 a host of obstacles make section 1810 a mostly theoretical but rarely if ever a practical vehicle for seeking a civil remedy for unlawful surveillance
3462067 dormant indeed the print version of the united states code annotated contains no case notes under section 1810 the parties have cited no other case in which a plaintiff has actually brought suit under section 1810 let alone secured a civil judgment under it
3462068 this is not to say that it is impossible to obtain relief under section 1810 but the fact that no one has ever done so reinforces the courts reading of the plain terms of the statute section 1810 is not user friendly and the impediments to using it may yet prove insurmountable
3462069 the lack of precedents under section 1810 complicates the task of charting a path forward nonetheless the court believes that dismissal with prejudice is not appropriate accordingly plaintiffs fisa claim will be dismissed with leave to amend

3462085 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so the union membership voted overwhelmingly thursday to reinstate labor day as one of the plants paid holidays while keeping eid al fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays

3462093 its always good to go against somebody new they have a different style running attack than we do and a lot of similarities in the passing game there is a little different philosophy but it will be good work for our defense and our offense
3462094 we dont tackle obviously but well form up a little bit we have a pretty smart football team on both sides and a lot of competition at the same time they are trying to protect each other its more of an evaluation process and cooler heads always prevail we were able to do that last time and im sure well be able to do it this time
3462095 basically it is the same both sessions well do different teamwork on one session than the other one is more play action the other one is more drop action the morning practice will be a little longer than the afternoon practice
3462096 its a little different you are still going to hit you hit your own players you hit somebody else its good especially in the third week to hit somebody else you get used to the talent level here first teamers second teamers third teamers what their strength is what their weakness is its always nice to go against somebody you dont know you play a lot more honest because you dont know the tendencies it is a good evaluation process for all of us
3462097 that is why you do it there is a respect level when you go against another team and you want to go out there and practice well and play well when you have different competition it always gets the juices flowing thats one of the reasons why we do it
3462098 our football team is pretty smart i told you our last time we practiced against them i thought it was a super bowl team and people laughed i dont think people are laughing anymore because of the talent they displayed last season we are going against a very talented team a lot of pro bowl players out there it will be a good test for us
3462099 its going to be nice we will get to go against different defenses techniques and players its going to be fun to kind of judge yourself early in the preseason to see where you are at for a couple of days
3462100 its no doubt about it its a little bit different going against your own guys it definitely brings up the intensity level

3462331 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3462332 for starters the damned ralph lauren polo logo totally upstages the olympic rings logo its huge
3462333 were not sure why so many people have been slamming these they look fine to us for what they are a little cheap looking sure but appropriate enough were not all that crazy about the caps we honestly think baseball caps would have worked better and it would have been nice to differentiate a little bit between the men and the women but for the most part its classic american sportswear which makes it perfect for the venue and unlike a lot of the looks we saw parading around the other night its tasteful
3462334 parade of slovenliness if you thought americans were talking a lot about the size of the ralph lauren logo on the u s olympians outfits as they entered the birds nest during the opening ceremony in beijing on friday its nothing compared with what people in other countries are saying about their respective teams clothes demeanor and general appearance
3462335 lest we forget that ralph lauren has created an entire big pony collection for men and women in which the logo is absolutely ginormous over sized at breast or back jean pocket a logo festival which is to say it couldve been worse in terms of brand promotion overwhelming team spirit
3462336 august 9 2008 geneva apj us ralph lauren the emperor of hushed prep chic shocked countless millions last night as the world watched the never ending parade of athletes during the opening ceremonies of the xxix olympiad in beijings birds nest stadium
3462337 the other troubling point was the overt branding seen in the lauren logo which shared prominence with the olympic rings and laurel was this a celebration of an athletic event or yet another chance at extended marketing who allows these things to occur this transcended product placement and smacked of rah rah commercialism

3462343 its definitely a little tougher coming home because obviously everyones expecting you to play well
3462344 so theres some added pressure and it was nice to come out and perform today under the gun
3462345 i felt like i played well thursday and i really didnt get anything out of my round
3462346 so i was trying to give myself opportunities hoping more putts would go in today than yesterday and that pretty much happened
3462347 the most disappointed i am about 17 is if i just make a bogey there i can still birdie 18 to force a playoff
3462348 that was just a really bad mistake on my part to three putt of the whole day thats what im most disappointed about thinking back on the tournament
3462349 what have i been doing for the last 34 years
3462350 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league
3462351 this season they buy one or two players and will want to win trophies under scolari
3462352 they chelsea and manchester united can spend 20 million pounds on players just for the bench but my belief is unshakable that we can compete with them
3462353 we are not the richest club and we have had a lot of work to do but i have kept my desire and my confidence that it is possible to win
3462354 we have got gaps that we need to fill with quality signings
3462355 but we are not the sort of club who can go out and spend an absolute fortune on certain players only to find they are not suited to us
3462356 and im not one to throw caution to the wind and sign 10 or 11 players i have to be careful with the chairmans money
3462357 my ambition has always been to play for spain and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world will help me realize that

3462363 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3462364 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3462365 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3462366 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3462367 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3462368 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3462369 join the nvidia folding team and start folding team 131015
3462370 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3462371 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3462460 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

3462618 at this point the majority of acquisition both live and in studio is being done in hd regardless of distribution format
3462619 with all that in mind we needed total flexibility to meet our clients requests ktv has always had a large inventory of ikegami cameras and as we prepared to grow our hd inventory ikegamis hdk 79ec camera system was a very easy choice for us
3462620 weve been working with ikegami since nab to complete our equipment package for the summer olympics in beijing
3462621 even though this is an all hd broadcast there are still many distribution outlets that require feeds in sd both in pal and ntsc the hdk 79ec is a very flexible multi format camera it addresses all the issues that we have in the hd marketplace with the different formats and it even supplies sd signals simultaneously that gives us the flexibility to work with anyone who is format dependent this camera allows us to address any situation and the image is the warmest most pristine picture that a camera can produce
3462622 our client broadcast systems amp equipment inc based in canada has built out a state of the art broadcast center in pangu plaza overlooking the olympic stadium and aquatics center
3462623 they are providing multiple studios control rooms and mcr facilities for non rights holders covering the games their facility is operating around the clock and serving clients from around the world in hd and sd pal and ntsc needless to say they need to be prepared to provide any format at any given time the applications with these cameras are virtually limitless it the camera can be used in a football game on the sideline as a handheld camera or it can be set up in the back row of a concert with a long lens its ideal for multi camera studio production for both live and episodic formats this is really the appeal of the hdk 79ec it can be retrofitted depending on the job
3462624 the support behind the product is as good if not better than the camera itself which is impeccable
3462625 from the sales people down to the service department ikegami has always been helpful to us they stand behind their product 100 percent and are always ready to address any issues with us or with the end users the combination of a beautiful image a top shelf product and a plus customer service is why a lot of our clients choose to exclusively use ikegami cameras
3462626 we already have systems booked for election coverage here in the states and are actively quoting packages for the upcoming nfl season among the elite engineers in our business they have always had a high preference for ikegami from a system standpoint ikegamis menus interfaces and control units are very intuitive ikegami has always made a high quality product and the hdk 79ec is no exception
3462627 the re opening of allens is proving that a successful local business can compete effectively against national organizations and still give something back to the community

3462630 next comes choosing the right time for harvesting harvesting only mature berries not allowing harvested berries to heat up sorting berries on intake making sure the beans dont crack during the depulping process double sorting after depulping making sure fermentation lasts the right length of time ie between 24 and 48 hours depending on the altitude and average temperature thoroughly washing the berries grading properly drying preferably both in the sun as well as in the drier to avoid mildewing the drying temperature should be moderate the temperature should never be turned up to speed the process and save time since an uneven drying process can significantly damage bean quality when drying is done on patios layers should not be too thick and beans should be constantly stirred never mix together beans of different grade of quality beans at different stages of dryness or beans from different altitudes selection patience and care are the operative words during processing since all these things make for the best bean quality and consequently the best price for the product

3462651 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3462652 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3462653 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3462654 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3462655 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3462656 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3462657 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3462658 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there

3462662 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3462663 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3462664 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long

3462710 i knew the language poorly did not know where to go whom to talk to
3462711 its a different approach than in russia it is believed here that the player himself knows what he needs what his mode of training his diet should be what is important to the coaches are the game results
3462712 language is not specifically taught but picked up in conversation my teammates didnt laugh when i spoke incorrectly i was a russian on the team and they were my friends
3462713 i could have done more but the policy there is take a long look at beginners giving them minimum ice time but then managed to prove that i am ready to work
3462714 everything depends on the person he learns from the experience or hes degraded russian ice hockey players should know what goes on in the nhl if you master that skill you will not be degraded and if the player learns nothing they certainly let you know how things are done there
3462715 i became stronger physically and gained endurance and even in the farm club you can learn the details gain good experience on how to play defense how to battle for the puck how to attack learn how to fight they dont all apply necessarily but if the situation calls for it you can use these skills but for example i did not have a fight
3462716 perhaps im not ready to say we discussed it with the chief manager that if the situation will develop as it did last year after the new year ill return to russia last year i did not expect to play in the nhl so soon i knew i was going to the farm club i needed that year to watch the league environment and draw conclusions is it worth it to continue in this direction or not

3462933 from what i hear people are excited and upbeat about the comeback and they were kinda wondering why i retired in the first place
3462934 they didnt want me to retire i guess they had that feeling of you didnt get beat up and you could still fight a lot of people dont know the reason one does something but i just didnt have that love for the sport anymore
3462935 i could just go to the gym and be the same guy put in my hours and then just go fight and see what happens
3462936 but i dont want that i want to put a hundred percent in to definitely get the win and if i dont get the win then at least i gave a helluva shot trying to get it thats the attitude i want to show my children that if theyre gonna do something do it all the way and do it the right way i dont want them to do it halfway i want them to do it fully and to really dedicate themselves
3462937 jesse james leija is a real good friend of mine here in san antonio he helped me out and let me use his gym to work there and hes given me a lot of motivation and inspiration to work out and he gave me the strength to say i can do it
3462938 it brings a lot of memories from when i was starting
3462939 im teaching these guys the same basic moves and i remember sitting there telling them okay throw the jab yet when i fight i never throw the jab laughs so it was bringing back a lot of funny memories but also things that i should be doing when im training
3462940 god willing we keep winning and it shouldnt be tough to get me a real good fight with a good fighter
3462941 i see this as a very hot division and this is the perfect time for me usually when youre in a division where theres no one around its kinda frustrating but when there are a bunch of big names in your weight division its pretty exciting and very motivating to train hard and beat these talented fighters
3462942 they want me to stay with them but i tell them i have to go run or i have to go to the gym they ask me why but my kids will know that when you say youre going to do something you have to try your best and do it i dont want to put a lot of pressure on my son or daughter i just want them to grow up knowing that if they have a dream they should try to capture it
3462943 hes pretty strong but i hear hes out of shape having put on a lot of weight
3462944 the only time well fight itll be a mega fight one that can make us both enough money to retire
3462945 he was able to walk with a cane ride a blue line with his daughter and waited for one hour to get a glimpse of his no 1 idol manny pacquiao
3462946 proud of manny representing the philippines he waited more than an hour to see his idol in cold weather despite a runny nose and feeling floaty from his condition but this motivated him t o get out of the house to see his idol

3462953 i know im weird i hope brad pitt doesnt read this hes never going to want to marry me now
3462954 i was class president on the cheerleading squad in a competitive show choir and in like six different clubs
3462955 the rst kiss of the movie was out on haight street with like 200 people watching outside
3462956 it was a crane shot im sure in the end it will be a really cool shot but it starts close and then it takes maybe a minute
3462957 thats a long time on film with everybody watching and like a fake mustache getting in your mouth
3462958 was long enough that you couldnt help thinking oh my god im kissing spicoli samantha ronson amazed at interest in lindsay lohan relationship carrie underwood tony romo still calls me

3462966 you might know that bacteria very quickly adapt to a changing environment they do this by changing their genetic information their dna there are several mechanisms how to do that one is mutation of a few parts of the genetic information but they are also able to integrate dna from foreign organism into their own dna and with that they can adapt to their environment
3462967 what we discovered now is one of the machines that are able to manipulate the genetic information of course this machine was known before but scientists got to a certain point where they were not able to make further progress the most important part of this machine is a motor that is able to slide over the dna and to pull the dna into a small nano machine made of proteins we were able to resolve the structure on an atomic level and describe the mechanism which makes the whole machine work
3462968 of course this is basic science and our discovery opens the door to further basic science the understanding how bacteria manipulate dna and how certain mechanisms work can lead to the discovery of new medical applications you know that one of the big problems of the changing of dna in bacteria is that they can get a certain resistance against antibiotics our discovery might give new impulses for research in that field

3463001 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

3463147 as impressive as edas tales of your evening together were i assumed it was a one time thing
3463148 how much do you know about the traffic of girls
3463149 a few weeks ago a contact brought us a video from a new s amp m site heaven itself doesnt have the kind of firewalls keeping this site safe from outside interference but we managed to preserve some of he feed anyway its pretty strong stuff
3463150 they were bouncing the signal off a bunch of servers around the globe but the trace i ran got lucky
3463151 the video was shot at a warehouse whose owners have property near here i thought it might be a good idea to come personally and see what some good old fashioned detective work can dig up
3463152 how can she take that much punishment and still be alive
3463153 either its special effect or its a new kind of snuff film
3463154 that girl can take the punishment she can because she is like faith a slayer
3463155 can i assume edas friends back in the states didnt tell her about disappearance of sunnydale
3463156 total information blackout still you hear bits and pieces here and there like a huge ass lake where there used to be a major american town i heard about la was that part of it
3463157 sort of the crew that jacked up la were connected with my team we had a major situation to deal with the stakes were high end of the world high the solution was to change a few rules of engagement had we really known what we were unleashing on the world well we might have still have done it but we would have prepared better ever since we have been fighting to find and rescue these girls from themselves and the more frequently the people who would try and hurt them or take advantage
3463158 last time you were here you said there was only one slayer what happened
3463159 technically i was right usually there is only one i had a hand in the reason why there were two for awhile now there are more
3463160 a very conservative estimate pegs the number at being about 1 of the female population of the planet
3463161 imagine waking up beside a someone youve been abusing who now has those kinds of powers
3463162 dont get me wrong guys most of these girls can take care of themselves but this video proves that some does not mean all as long as any girls are in danger its my job and the job of the new watchers council to figure out how to get to them and help them out
3463163 arent you making the broad assumption that this little chickie is an unwilling participant in these matters
3463164 yes i am and i know how naive that makes me sound but i would rather err on the side of caution as would you
3463165 because whoever is behind this isnt just taking dirty pictures rumours palce a few of our girls acting as enforceers for petty dictators and we think that they were purchese from these assholes apparently for a small fortune you can rent yourself a slayer i can testify that slayers properly trained make for a crude but effective military force imagine sending someone who can take that kind of punishment after your foes whoever they may be
3463166 of course our inquires will be discrete but you might want to prepare yourself for a few dead ends the human traffic network is large and finding any one type of cargo can be difficult most of the worlds countries are starting to take official notice of such activities making the profit margin versus risk factor prohibitive
3463167 nice to know you all take such an interest in the welfare of others
3463168 im guessing youre early to mid twentys miss faith no doubt your abilities came to you during your teens and since i can tell youre from south boston and i can smell the gutter mud on you girl clear as day im betting you didnt rush out and start fighting the good fight as soon as you realized how much more capable you were you did what most of us would do you tracked down some old friends for a little payback tell me miss lehane how good did it feel when you showed them how much stronger you were did you enjoy making them grovel and beg for their lives like they tried to do to you
3463169 i see why you accompany mr harris ive noticed he has that effect people like us
3463170 i assume you are looking to lagoon company for assistance in finding these lost lambs of yours
3463171 well that and to be honest the money behind these guys is huge and since the trail lead me here that means im either going to be working for or against someone i owe a favour to from the last time i was here
3463172 you suspect that the resources behind these men might connect with hotel moscow
3463173 i know balalaika doesnt have a problem making a buck but i care about these girls my friends and i feel an responsibility to them and if retrieving them requires an aggressive response i would hope to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with hotel moscow
3463174 listen to the diplomat youve certainly learned a trick or two since last you walked these streets dear but you know how things are in roanapur you want to rescue these girls balalaika wont stop you unless its worth it to do so but if it is in her best interest to stop you it will take a lot more then your clever turns of phrase and your tough little friend to keep you alive
3463175 so who is this bally lichen again bal al aika
3463176 shes head of the local branch of the russian mafia known as hotel moscow shes dangerous xander no offense but demons vampires supernatural beasties that is dangerous a thug with delusions of grandeur isnt high on my list of things to be concerned over
3463177 you havent been practicing you cant expect to make the moscow women swoon if you speak like a peasant
3463178 theres nothing wrong with you a few years serving in any decent military wouldnt solve indeed it seems youve improved yourself tremendously since last we saw you
3463179 nonsense such an injury adds character to a mans face how do you young people say it chicks dig scars
3463180 miss balalaika may i introduce you to my partner faith she is one of the vampire slayers i told you of and part of the reason i came out here
3463181 well ive never met a real live russian mob boss before i was expecting someone a little less marlane dietrich
3463182 you have xanders sense of humor if not his pop cultural acumen dietrich was german
3463183 sorry she was the only foreign hottie i could think of
3463184 so what brings you to our little slice of heaven did you really miss us that much
3463185 faith and i are following the trail of human traffic specifically the enslavement and sale of young girls
3463186 he showed her the video feed and balalaika to her credit did not blink or shudder once
3463187 the group i hooked up with im remembering how well informed you are so i wont bore you with the details caused a bit of collateral damage while ending a threat to well to everything we activated every slayer in the world every girl of a certain age range who ever had the potential to be a slayer became one ever since then my team has been tracking these girls and offering training when we can and giving them support when they cant or wont come to us
3463188 so you think these girls are more of your wampere killers
3463189 one girl in all the world she alone will fight against the darkness or at least that was the way until my friends and i decided our way was better of course there are drawbacks imagine being a ninety pound weakling one day and waking up the next with oh say your level of combat skill and ability but no training in how to use it
3463190 assuming there are vampire slayers among the group producing these movies why would they continue to allow themselves to be treated and controlled thus
3463191 weve already seen what happens to slayers who were mentally unstable before being activated one girl in particular is responding to treatment but since she is several times as strong as her doctors and has been known to kill or maim anyone she regards as threatening her progress is slow and she may never be completely healed
3463192 im still waiting to hear why you think i can help you and why i should even care
3463193 i think you want to help us because the japanese are still pissed over a recent visit hotel moscow made to japan i didnt get all the details but word is you guys burned a lot of bridges funny thing about the yakuza is not all the full body animal tattoos are for shock appeal some of them are to let people know which demon lord they secretly owe their souls to or what their level of magical training might be
3463194 you think that having slayers as allies would counter a potential threat like that i thought i taught you better skills in negotiation and tactics then that alexander
3463195 no you are here for one reason only you wish to declare war you respect hotel moscow so you would prefer not to fight me since you know what that would entail so you tempt me with the possibility of an alliance in the hopes that my response will make it easier for you to know how much chaos you can cause here before ill be obligated to deal with you and your bodyguard
3463196 her fingers excitedly drummed the table close to the gun her meaning was clear there would be only one chance for things to go right or else they would start going very very wrong
3463197 captain i apologize ive been amongst civilians for so long i forget my manners
3463198 so these girls are your friends are they close are you did you buy them christmas gifts perhaps
3463199 i consider slayers friends but even more important i consider anyone that would do something like this to a person an enemy and i intend to completely destroy that enemy what the girls do with their freedom once they have it is their choice killing their captors and destroying the organization controlling them is mine
3463200 so you are committed to going to war then no matter what even if it places you at odds with me with all of roanapur you will still fight this battle
3463201 no i will win this battle ive gotten better since the last time i was here a lot better
3463202 its nothing bad you just remind them of someone who lives here is all
3463203 lethally bad ass someone but youll meet revy soon enough and you can decide for yourself
3463204 sooner then you think i passed dutch a cargo running job the recent storms in the area wiped out the supplies of a encampment and they contracted to chang for supplies he was running short and so came to me i had the materials but not the manpower for delivery so i went to dutch the lagoon left this morning and radioed in just before you arrived
3463205 along with the usual staples they asked for there was an additional request packets of whole blood lots of it type was not an issue
3463206 i thought we were looking for vampire slayers not vampires
3463207 slayers need guarding even if they are slaves the best way you can do that effectively would be to have something on hand that you know can take on a slayer especially if she isnt trained to know how to fight back
3463208 i get it the vampires watch the slayers and the human guards control the compound
3463209 if your slayers are guarded by vampires would the vampires not simply feed upon the prisoners
3463210 they probably do from time to time to keep them weak but slayer blood is kinda potant and im sure nobody here needs to be told what happens of you leave an addict alone in a room filled with drugs
3463211 still would this not imply that your quarry was rather knowledgeable about matters concerning your slayers they tracked them located them have corralled them and are using an effective force to guard them such knowledge should by itself narrow the field of possible suspects of who might be responsible
3463212 these bastards are going to tell me everything about their organization before we are finished with them
3463213 well you might have to ensure they survive revys wrath
3463214 well then lets get out there and kick some ass
3463215 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections
3463216 i would never go back on my word unless there was something in it for me
3463217 we dont care who gets the bailout we just like to give away borrowed money hey nancy they want more ok 800 billion

3463253 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3463254 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3463255 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3463256 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3463257 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3463268 the place is so dirty and infected we cannot take patients here any more
3463269 this is the kind of humanitarian aid being sent in by georgia

3463290 this action is not pleasant but is necessary in order to make sure lucent remains a competitive player
3463291 lack of compassionfor retirees and their dependants while simultaneously defending their own excessive and unwarranted compensation is absurd
3463292 lucent technologies may be a shadow of its former self but there is one place where this company still puts world class numbers on the board and thats executive compensation in two years since becoming chief executive patricia russo has received compensation worth more than 44 million according to equilar a san mateo calif firm that tracks executive compensation and since january 2002 when russo rejoined murry hill n j based lucent as chief executive her four top lieutenants all lucent lifers have received cash retention payments totaling 10 million to keep them from lraving moreover in fiscal 2003 these four executive frank damelio william oshea janet davidson and james brewington were paid salaries totaling 2 4 million and bonuses totaling 2 8 million plus they were granted 3 75 million in options
3463293 the cost of retiree benefits have soared to 800 million or about 10 of total revenue an unsustainable level

3463346 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3463347 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3463348 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3463349 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3463350 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3463351 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3463352 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3463353 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3463354 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3463355 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3463356 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3463357 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today
3463358 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3463359 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3463360 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3463361 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3463362 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3463363 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3463364 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3463365 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3463366 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3463367 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3463368 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3463369 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3463370 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3463371 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3463372 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3463373 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3463374 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3463375 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3463376 my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead
3463377 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3463378 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3463379 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3463380 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3463381 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3463382 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3463383 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3463384 id be willing to introduce a resolution saying leave it alone
3463385 under the faulkner act we can leave that seat vacant and i believe we should
3463386 let the voters decide we should not be picking council people here
3463387 i aim to change the world one act of random kindness at a time
3463388 i aim to serve my country and all its people in all i do
3463389 i aim to champion freedom of speech in britain and abroad
3463390 a lot of you keep asking me why my profile says single and why i seem sad lately so before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about 2 weeks ago
3463391 we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us
3463392 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3463393 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3463394 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3463395 that included the field directly south of the plant on airport property where we were informed that items had been buried
3463396 we are very pleased with our financial results for the quarter including the significant increase in our royalty revenues and the reduction in total costs and expenses which reflects the impact of our recent asset sales and ongoing restructuring activities as we continue to reduce our cost structure
3463397 after an increase in influenza related deaths in the second quarter we experienced the typical seasonal slowdown in the third quarter
3463398 despite the market challenges we were able to maintain revenues at a level consistent with 2007 results
3463399 design professionals who rely on the performance and features of a desktop workstation can now get this same level of performance in a notebook

3463401 we followed dean in a lot of games last season and he was very good but he had injury problems before that
3463402 he has since told me he is fit now i spoke with him in trinidad and i told him he had to lose weight and be better physically because technically he is good but he is not quick
3463403 i was really impressed with the way theo walcott finished the season
3463404 if people arent demanding hes in the england team theyre writing him off
3463405 but i think hell develop into a world class player if people just give him some space to express himself
3463406 we need to focus on tomorrow against pakistan a team that we can and should beat
3463407 hes very smart very organized he just was always headed in this direction every day he was looking to hurt someone it was the only satisfaction he got in life
3463408 the question is whether he was too tall to be the person in that video that basically was the defense the physical evidence showed it was not him regardless of what he said
3463409 he got away with it a long time because technology hadnt caught up to him
3463410 you hate to see that knowing that potentially if the technology had been as good when the crime was committed someone else would not have been killed
3463411 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks
3463412 hed walk down the street with a sawed off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open just to see the reaction of people
3463413 but he would back me up to like 60 yards
3463414 he would make it really almost impossible for me to make did you see the defense they weren t rushing very hard were they i knew i had all kinds of time it s fun to be able to be a part of that

3463461 politicians get millions in campaign cash the special interests get what they want and we get the short end of the stick if youre tired of this system i say its time for a change

3463468 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3463469 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3463470 i dont think the turnout has been high enough to cause any

3463476 i hope the leadership in new delhi and islamabad rising above political considerations would act with wisdom and give a go ahead to the opening of the road at the earliest
3463477 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3463478 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3463479 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3463480 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3463481 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3463482 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3463483 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3463484 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3463485 we have learnt that aziz was exhorting people to hold silent and peaceful protests and it was during this that he was fired upon
3463486 the hurriyat has called for peaceful protests and a shut down and protests will continue for the next four days

3463530 all aspects of the curriculum must integrate multicultural critical thinking and justice concepts and practice
3463531 diversity and equity issues are integrated into all aspects of the teacher training curriculum
3463532 the purpose of education in an unjust society is to bring about equality and justice
3463533 schools should be the place where students can analyze the forces which maintain injustice and develop the knowledge hope and strategies needed to create a more just society for us all
3463534 every student whom we help to read and write is being provided with tools to defend herself or himself
3463535 i also learned that all the institutions in this country are inherently racist and exist for the purpose of main taining the power and wealth of the dominant group
3463536 a new recognition of themselves as race privileged capable of racist thoughts and behaviors
3463537 i can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely repre sented i can if i wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time i can easily buy posters postcards picture books greeting cards dolls toys and childrens magazines featuring people of my race i can take a job with an affirmative action employer without having coworkers on the job suspect that i got it because of race i can choose blemish cover or bandages in flesh color and have them more or less match my skin
3463538 whiteness protected me from many kinds of hostility distress and violence which i was being subtly trained to visit in turn upon people of color
3463539 to redesign social systems we need first to acknowledge their colossal unseen dimensions
3463540 because the ideology of white racial superiority is so deeply embedded in our culture the process of
3463541 keep in mind that learning about racial identity and racism is a lifelong process
3463542 racism is learned and it can be unlearned but it takes a commitment to stay aware to keep working and to accept the unlearning as a lifelong journey

3463549 students reenacted the forced migration of over fifty million africans brought to the americas and sold into slavery and the slaughtering of native americans for land and gold
3463550 they mask the obstacles that people of color have faced and how they have confronted those obstacles
3463551 in our racist sexist classist and hetereosexist society our decisions about word usage are political decisions
3463552 was borne out of an explicitly political statement that signaled a solidarity among progressive african americans asian americans latinos native americans and pacific islanders
3463553 the arbitrariness of designating one variety of english over another as
3463554 on the other hand it is equally important to understand that students who do not have access to the politically popular dialect form in this country are less likely to succeed economically how can both realities be embraced
3463555 language policy in the united states continues to be used as an effective tool to control access to social economic and political resources
3463556 a tool to interpret and challenge inequities in our society
3463557 transformed to consider how science itself is conceptualized valued and practiced by those who have traditionally been outside the scientific mainstream
3463558 where do people learn the values of this system just think back to elementary school columbus who killed hundreds of native americans in his search for gold is touted as a hero
3463559 wealthy countries became wealthy by exploiting the resources of the southern countries
3463560 the colonial and capitalist systems which grew up together were also inherently and inescapably racist
3463561 the world financial system is a greater cause of hunger in africa than is bad weather
3463562 i had not previously understood that capitalism requires keeping a large group of people in extreme poverty and is deliberately and purposefully racist promoting divisions among people in order for the dominant group to maintain political economic and social power and control
3463563 we must ask how sexism classism and linguicism are part of this oppression called racism

3463572 that is something which not everyone can accept but only those for whom god has appointed it for while some are incapable of marriage because they were born so or made so by men there are others who have themselves renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let those accept it who can
3463573 god has given people who worship false gods up to shameful passions their women have exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural and their men in turn giving up natural relations with women burn with lust for one another males behave indecently with males and paid in their own persons the fitting wage of such perversion

3463624 on a computer that is running windows vista or windows server 2008 you open device manager to review the properties of a driver however the digital signer field on the driver tab displays the following status message not digitally signed this behavior occurs even though the driver is digitally signed
3463625 this problem occurs because device manager verifies the digital signing information by using the class guid of the previous driver and the driver name of the current driver because no driver is found to match the old class guid device manager detects the driver as an unsigned driver

3463627 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3463628 it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor
3463629 in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3463630 i think at one point his actions were referred to as thuggery or he was referred to as a thug we take offense to that
3463631 these are young professional people that are very good at what they do and are very sensitive to how theyre portrayed in the public light i was offended by that reference to him hes not a thug hes a young football player whos trying to be at his best who happens to play the game very physically
3463632 im pretty proud of the team weve taken some big steps
3463633 it was a tough night tonight but the players responded pretty well
3463634 if the incident has occurred accidentally or not they have to rule it as no goal
3463635 the infringements seen so therefore the goal shouldnt be scored
3463636 personally i think its a top four decision im prepared to say that
3463637 quite often the tough decisions go with the teams in the top four and you dont get the rub of the green
3463638 it was wrong and also they should have had a player sent off its pretty hard to swallow
3463639 we thought we would hold on i thought germany panicked
3463640 if you talk about boring hockey i thought they smashed the ball into the circle i dont know how many times if thats how hockeys going to be played then people may not watch if for long
3463641 it might have been a bit boring in places but i think they played pretty well and showed that we should be here
3463642 at nine minutes to nine we received a call from a woman who said that her son had been shot as a result of that we notified police
3463643 maybe shes creating too much expectation for herself and its putting a little too much pressure on her
3463644 if youre ranked 150 and you come up to 50 in the world that can sometimes happen you are not focused enough on what youre doing youre thinking too much ahead or in the past or whatever
3463645 they said youve got to focus on the task at hand and you cant let your mind drift that happens to the best athletes it happened to myself
3463646 sometimes you make unbelievable progress and you hit a point and say hey what have i done thats not unusual i feel for her that it happened in these matches but i dont think its a form slump
3463647 you could say its one of the worst feelings its the olympics and im part of the team and staying in the village
3463648 obviously theyre not going to give me a tough time because i lost but its nice to make others proud and to win for new zealand
3463649 id love to go to the world games in 2010
3463650 its where i started off in 1978 it would be quite fun to go back there again and then maybe look ahead to london
3463651 i have another life breeding and training race horses in new zealand we live there the family are there all these things have got to come into consideration
3463652 the original plan was to buy this horse bring him to the games hopefully go well and then sell him plans are always there to change arent they
3463653 i have to go home and have a good think about it
3463654 ive enjoyed this i like riding this horse i think theres a lot of improvement in him we just have to work out a programme
3463655 i love being in the whole atmosphere again its been great being amongst a lot of friends and people that ive spent a lot of time with over the last 25 30 years
3463656 now that ive had this break ive sort of freshened up again
3463657 i think its been very successful on a lot of levels ive finished the competition and finished it well
3463658 did i exceed expectations i think ive probably matched them
3463659 he just wasnt himself i dont know whether he was tired or sore hes usually a careful jumper
3463660 we have to look at how were going to create better possibilities with our riders and how were going to work with them in the future

3463665 then according to the accountant the facility group estimates an employee only works 65 percent of the time 35 percent goofing off not working sick vacation inefficiency so they divide 1 3 their alleged cost to employee 65 inefficiency and come up with a neat figure of 2 0 which they multiply times the employees salary for every hour the employee works for example if an employees salary is 200 an hour they claim he costs them 400 and bill that employee out at 400

3463674 people were displaced and our support systems disappeared our neighbors who used to be there for years and years in some cases are gone and people have trouble with that they look next door and their buddy is not their anymore
3463675 although they have started rebuilding their homes or trying to rebuild their homes or they may be still looking for a place to live cause we still have a lot of families displaced the stress level is high
3463676 the inability to finalize to put closure on an event brings depression

3463678 we are extremely pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with the egyptian government

3463680 the individual sector etfs are going to be a lot more volatile than the broader market funds
3463681 in july that worked in the favor of etfs tied to indexes that were shorting specific sectors particularly commodities but when youre investing that narrowly things can change very quickly
3463682 with sector and inverse etfs youve got to watch them like a hawk
3463683 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3463684 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3463685 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3463686 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3463687 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3463688 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3463689 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3463690 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3463691 the most unfair thing about life is the way it ends i mean life is tough it takes up a lot of your time what do you get at the end of it a death whats that a bonus
3463692 i think the life cycle is all backwards you should die first get it out of the way then you live in an old age home you get kicked out when youre too young you get a gold watch you go to work you work forty years until youre young enough to enjoy your retirement you do drugs alcohol you party you get ready for high school you go to grade school you become a kid you play you have no responsibilities you become a little baby you go back into the womb you spend your last nine months floating and you finish off as an orgasm

3463701 im happy with my decision im still an american citizen i still play in the nba i still live in los angeles im still from michigan i just chose to go with my heritage a little farther back and see if theyd allow me to play for them and i did
3463702 he didnt want to support me when i played the u s a he said i hope the u s a beats you
3463703 hes proud of me no matter what i do but at first he was a little surprised at what was going on
3463704 i thought we were going to play in the qualifier and lose and that was going to be it
3463705 i didnt play to come to the olympics i didnt have any idea i knew dirk nowitzki was good i didnt know anybody else on the team
3463706 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3463707 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3463708 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3463709 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3463710 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3463711 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3463712 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3463713 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3463714 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside

3463722 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines standing well in excess of any historic precedent for demand weakness
3463723 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3463724 the first kiss of the movie was out on haight street with like 200 people watching outside
3463725 i wanted to be the best actor that i could be its just sad for me because i know i worked so hard and i just feel like in some way i kind of blew it its just hard to get away from what i see as the stain of these bad movies
3463726 and i thought yeah i got these three movies and then i saw them all
3463727 i did fucking sword fighting for eight months what am i ever going to use that for and horseback riding
3463728 then we got to prague or ireland and they say oh yeah that scenes been cut
3463729 there is no denying it the system failed the active wrongdoing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong
3463730 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3463731 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime

3463737 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3463738 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3463739 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3463740 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3463741 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3463742 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3463743 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3463744 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3463745 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3463746 they are saying that they are doing like over 4 000 tests but its just very difficult
3463747 but hopefully they can make these olympic games very clean
3463748 and the bear just came and pounced on him for no apparent reason
3463749 i dont know if you would call a bear like that a demented bear like some people or a super bear that decides hey i can take a person
3463750 its a tragedy either way and now i get to wait like everybody else
3463751 its incredibly ironic that shes released from jail for his attempted murder and within five hours of her return home hes dead
3463752 a criminal lawyer i knew many years ago said he always had scientific evidence tests repeated by an independent lab he said that about half the time they got a different result than the police or fbi labs to him that proved either that the tests were no good or the labs were stocked with liars that was twenty years ago but its looking pretty prescient

3463758 i would like to take the time to inform everyone interested in knowing about the status of the band
3463759 i definitely want to keep on playing and touring as its very important for me to keep on playing music while we have this break with
3463760 i also want to express my respect for everyone who has supported the families of

3463764 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3463765 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3463766 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
3463767 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3463768 at the markets we have been buying food it has become just too expensive
3463769 a lot of markets just dont have any food to buy
3463770 as a result we are not able to buy food in ethiopia anymore
3463771 at a local level food prices are increasing and that of course impacts on our programs making them more expensive
3463772 it means that we have to increase the amount of money we are asking from our donors
3463773 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3463774 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3463775 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet
3463776 i am well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps
3463777 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3463778 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3463779 in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3463780 i want to stress that last point because there is no denying it the system failed
3463781 the active wrongdoing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3463782 i have made repeatedly clear in both private meetings with department employees and in public appearances that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3463783 two wrongs do not make a right the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong

3463795 its not an isolated problem the mail server goes down regularly i had the joy of receiving an invoice from apple for 99 for another year of me just before the server went down its unreliable stop preaching the apple line the mail system needs to be fixed
3463796 a lot of us rely on email for a variety of reasons if apple cannot fix this they are not worthy of my money apparently att amp t yahoo mail is also experiencing intermittent hiccups so at times i cant access either account perhaps i will just use google mail and no longer renew my mobileme account this october this is not only unacceptable but downright incompetent and intolerable some heads should roll on apple
3463797 mobileme members were unable to access mobileme mail normal service has been restored we apologize for any inconvenience
3463798 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2
3463799 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3463800 i wanted to be the best actor that i could be its just sad for me because i know i worked so hard and i just feel like in some way i kind of blew it its just hard to get away from what i see as the stain of these bad movies
3463801 trust australia to have the hot swimmer chick doing scandalous bikini shots
3463802 in the name of all competitors i promise that we shall take part in these olympic games respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams
3463803 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3463804 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3463805 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus

3463807 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3463808 a breakthrough because it opens the way to implement group support systems in the virtual world
3463809 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3463810 you do what you want but if you do this then these are the likely results and if you do that then those are the consequences
3463811 if you want to be our friend then do this and dont do that
3463812 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3463813 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges
3463814 this is the first time ive decided to leave something i really truly love i will dearly miss getting a chance to work with
3463815 the science really had not caught up with the trans generational stuff
3463816 the farm bill that is in conference would not only provide an increase in benefits it would tie them to the inflation rate in the future
3463817 but right now that is tied up because of the presidents opposition to other parts of the bill
3463818 im pleased that the budget resolution contains a reserve fund for an additional 35 billion stimulus package which could include housing relief extended unemployment insurance benefits food stamps and help with utility bills
3463819 as the price of basic groceries such as milk bread and eggs continues to escalate too many mainers rely on this vital program for us to delay action any longer
3463820 this is particularly the case for low wage workers those wages at the bottom are growing much more slowly than wages in the middle or at the top
3463821 the food stamp data is just another way of telling that story

3463828 i wish i had this training when i was there before
3463829 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
3463830 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
3463831 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
3463832 you are never going to see the world the same
3463833 we can read body language now and i know what i am looking for
3463834 however anecdotal evidence and after action reports from commanders in theater say that this training is saving lives the measure of success right now is when a marine returns from a patrol convoy or standing a post and is excited that he used the combat hunter training
3463835 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3463836 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3463837 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3463838 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3463839 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3463840 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3463841 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3463842 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3463843 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3463844 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3463845 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3463846 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened

3463848 what are their fears when it comes to the state rules
3463849 there was no information about nail salons you thought everything was your fault as a manicurist
3463850 there were fireworks because it was the 4th of july i didnt know anything
3463851 i thought there must be a party every day in america
3463852 nail salon workers felt for the first time that people cared about us
3463853 they still want me to do something that is more financially well off
3463854 but they understand more now in terms of what i do and why i work with community
3463855 self professed experts will tell you that requirements gathering is the most critical part of the project because if you get it wrong then all the rest of your work goes towards building the wrong thing this is sooooort of true in a skewed way but its not the complete picture
3463856 the problem with this view is that requirements gathering basically never works
3463857 actually i think its a great idea in fact ive long wished that a substantial number
3463858 can i put books in microsoft reader format on kindle how about txt format
3463859 that is one technology that i just do not understand i dont see the appeal i dont like
3463860 not saying this isnt a good story and maybe even good news but a reliance on unattributed and or
3463861 from my perspective this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3463862 the prospect that well have more of the same that is the source of angst of many republicans around the country
3463863 the russian attacks on georgia if left unchecked could easily trigger more conflict in the future
3463864 it is also about resisting russias openly hegemonic designs on its neighbors wall street journal

3463866 listen vladimir i served with tsar nicolas i knew tsar nicolas tsar nicolas was a friend of mine vladimir youre no tsar nicolas
3463867 we should all be greatful that the bush administrations strong diplomatic efforts worked
3463868 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3463869 cuz the busheviks have been raving for the last 2 years about the great democratizing spirit of the georgians
3463870 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
3463871 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
3463872 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
3463873 im committed to making sure that theres equal pay for equal work that is my record and you can count on it
3463874 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated

3463886 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3463887 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3463888 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3463889 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3463890 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3463891 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3463892 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3463893 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3463894 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3463895 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3463896 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3463897 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3463898 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair

3463901 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3463902 i told them this community would reject that like a baboons heart
3463903 they were dropping subscriptions three days a week was kind of a slap in the face to the community they felt embarrassed by it
3463904 were just growing like crazy and the money will let us scale the company even more
3463905 our growth is primarily limited by the number of sales people we have

3463935 it puts us in an incredibly tough spot right before primaries right before the general election
3463936 its the hardest thing in the world to say sorry i promised you 10 000 for your playroom at your kindergarten center but i dont have that 10 000 to give you anymore
3463937 i was really impressed with the way theo walcott finished the season
3463938 if people arent demanding hes in the england team theyre writing him off
3463939 but i think hell develop into a world class player if people just give him some space to express himself
3463940 they are both great sides on their day but maybe they dont win enough games when they dont play well
3463941 my club know my decision and it will not change
3463942 if i leave valencia my dream will be to go to barcelona
3463943 i know there is interest from some big clubs in england but i do not just want to move for the money
3463944 its certainly given us more determination to go one step further in all competitions
3463945 we came so close in everything last year but weve got a new manager weve got some great signings who look very good who i think can strengthen the side and push us on to another level
3463946 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3463947 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3463948 the last few seasons we have done very well and we were very close but we want to win these titles and this season we will try again
3463949 if you dont know whats wrong after about five or six months and you have no improvement it is difficult in your mind to motivate yourself
3463950 to walk in the gym to walk with the physio and feel a little bit of an improvement then you get the motivation and you can keep going
3463951 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3463952 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3463953 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3463954 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3463955 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3463956 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3463957 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3463958 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3463959 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3463976 how much you wanna make a bet i can throw a football over them mountains
3463977 owner wont panic this time and things will go back to normal
3463978 but whats become normal now is really absurd if you think about it
3463979 if the laws change our hope is to come back because weve built a life here we dont want to move
3463980 until 1990 it was on the books that the u s would not admit people if you were gay the exclusion of same sex families is not accidental
3463981 frc does not believe that homosexual relationships are the equivalent of marriage and we therefore oppose any legislation that would treat such relationships as the equivalent of marriage
3463982 in reality it is quite difficult to get a green card even for an opposite sex marriage
3463983 theres a tremendous burden with an involved application and you have to sign an affidavit that you will support the person for 10 years and they wont become a public burden and that obligation can outlast the marriage
3463984 i was moved to sign on because of compelling and devastating stories ive heard from constituents who have fallen in love and been split apart by an immigration law
3463985 a lot of kids after she left did not even want to take french anymore
3463986 she was great at motivating the kids thats why we miss her so much
3463987 situations like this lead to a general sense of instability and so i think investors will have to weigh up chances of continuing problems in the region going forward
3463988 you wonder how much transportation risk has been mitigated or reduced by building infrastructure through more volatile regions but its too early to make that assessment just yet
3463989 the conflict should give second thoughts about seeing any region as the safe haven or the magic bullet type solution to energy security
3463990 if you look at the long war in chechnya that russia had again it had no measurable impact on the domestic growth scenario
3463991 and that was a long and a bad and a protracted war i dont really see this having any impact investors will look at it digest it and if they see that event has no impact on their investments they wont divest
3463992 one likely result is that the events will harden the resolve of those governments and companies who seek to bypass russia in extracting caspian resources
3463993 the russian military actions in georgia will likely have a profound affect on relations between russia and all the former soviet states particularly ukraine which like georgia aspires to join nato
3463994 going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3463995 i dont think what has happened substantially changes the fundamentals for other countries but it may be a wake up call to some people who hadnt properly appreciated potential russian impact in the region
3463996 youd expect this to affect sentiment towards them as it is more evidence of russia trying to exert control over its nearest neighbors
3463997 a more aggressive russian foreign policy within the former soviet union is likely to pose a threat to ukrainian asset prices in due course
3463998 obviously people will also be looking at the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3463999 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas with a large russian population
3464000 a worsening in relations between russia and the west would put at risk russian supplies of gas to european countries
3464001 its been one thing after another highlighting the lack of regard for the rule of law in russia
3464002 its hard to find companies that arent in some way connected with the russian government which we dont particularly trust
3464003 today the georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice called the state of georgia against the state of russia because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3464004 quite honestly we cannot afford to fight for principle at this point when the law is against us
3464005 more often than not get into the hands of people who are coming into the home to do bad things
3464006 i dont think any of us are thrilled with the supreme court decision but the decision is sufficiently vague that it does not have any prohibition against child safety locks

3464013 the social security legislation is very clear about what a relationship is youre either single or a couple a couple is in the nature of marriage which includes civil union and de facto
3464014 its been the same for years its been tested in court theres no interest in changing it
3464015 now includes something called triples and my mind just boggles

3464020 y por la nula aportaci n del psoe a trav s de la direcci n general de juventud a este proyecto
3464021 a pesar de contar una vez m s con la aportaci n econ mica del consistorio santanderino
3464022 ha dejado patente que el summer festival s lo le interesa para utilizarlo como un arma arrojadiza contra el ayuntamiento de santander
3464023 si hubiera tenido el m s m nimo inter s por que se garantizara la pervivencia del festival
3464024 que nunca han aportado ni un solo euro a esta iniciativa y no a la nica que lo ha apoyado desde el principio
3464025 es una pena que en lugar de apoyarnos en nuestra reclamaci n de mayor apoyo del gobierno de cantabria para el summer festival como ocurre con otros gobiernos auton micos en ciudades donde se celebran este tipo de festivales juventudes socialistas haya preferido utilizarlo pol ticamente al servicio del psoe y arremeter contra el ayuntamiento de santander

3464041 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3464042 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3464043 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3464044 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3464045 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3464046 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3464047 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3464048 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3464049 considero que la lecci n que hay que retomar sin soberbia es el hecho que esper bamos que se establezca con claridad cu l es el rumbo que el pueblo determina ese rumbo es que tenemos que ir al cambio y ese cambio tiene que ser con una desconcentraci n del poder y que mantenga la unidad del pa s

3464051 los prefectos deben enfrentar una nueva realidad que se ha demostrado con los resultados del referendo hubo un considerable aumento de apoyo de los ciudadanos al programa de cambio del presidente
3464052 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3464053 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3464054 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3464055 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3464056 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3464057 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3464058 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3464059 john mccain believes in a strong national defense a smaller more accountable government steady economic growth and opportunity the dignity of life and traditional values
3464060 in hip hop today people think its a necessity to rep where theyre from and i definitely agree but i also feel its important to represent the people in general so that we will connect
3464061 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
3464062 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
3464063 what reasons do we have to expect a singular and universal justice is that not like protecting the plurality of playwrights while insisting that they all write the same play
3464064 justice seems to be universal in character for the same reason that autonomy and attachment are reiterative out of recognition of and respect for the human agents who create the moral world and who come by virtue of that creativity to have lives and countries of their own
3464065 the principles and rules of justice have been worked out over many centuries so as to protect human agents and set them free for their creative reiterative tasks one set of principles for one set of agents
3464066 why should we value human agency if we are unwilling to give it any room for maneuver and invention
3464067 above all he comes off as a huge booster of online video believing its nonstopness will keep him from resorting to platitudes
3464068 fisher tells a true and intoxicating story with the strong wry wit that she poured into bestsellers like postcards from the edge born to celebrity parents she was picked to play a princess in the original star wars when only 19 years old alas aside from a demanding career and her role as a single mother carrie also spends her free time battling addiction weathering the wild ride of manic depression and lounging around various mental institutions its an incredible tale from having elizabeth taylor as a stepmother to marrying and divorcing paul simon from having the father of her daughter leave her for a man to ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed

3464071 overall the picture for the region has become somewhat more pessimistic than a quarter ago the reasons for this are less related to the us business cycle and more to global energy and commodity prices
3464072 keep the region growing at respectable rates this year and next
3464073 while pressures are more visible macroeconomic stability is not under threat
3464074 i definitely had the big three poster the troy aikman michael irvin and emmitt smith poster

3464086 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate
3464087 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3464088 it sounded very totalitarian i thought it sounded undemocratic and i was completely shocked
3464089 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3464090 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee
3464091 if someone brings you private correspondence youll use that in investigating a complaint
3464092 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3464093 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3464094 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3464095 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3464096 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up
3464097 these people know they are being watched they know it
3464098 yeah you would think that the people who have my granddaughter right now would be smart enough to turn this girl back in to her family i dont want anymore of this going on
3464099 you really believe that george with all the evidence out there to the counter
3464100 oh deeply you know something stuff thats out there so far i hope i can say this as politely as i can evidence thats out there is circumstantial evidence thats out there is being drawn up in someones mind just because some things look like its going in one way it could go in a totally different way
3464101 its just a feeling that we have we dont like to talk about it because it hurts us
3464102 geez i wish i wasnt losing my house right now so if im making a profit somehow its not doing me a lot of good
3464103 can we be wrong yes but were doing more than sitting around talking about someone missing
3464104 if it comes out that theyre close it could bring harm to caylee
3464105 she wants to see her family talk to her family but shes willing to sacrifice that for caylee
3464106 smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car
3464107 about the occurrence of current philosophy of government and prospect that well have more of the same
3464108 seeing the two different john mccains is a fracture to his credibility
3464109 barack obamas claims to bipartisan appeal are as thin as his record
3464110 republicans will vote for a commander in chief ready to lead not a partisan politician who is only ready to raise taxes and increase spending
3464111 a very large number of us feel deeply that john mccain good man that he is will be a continuation of bush
3464112 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3464113 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3464114 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3464115 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3464116 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3464117 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3464118 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3464119 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3464120 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3464121 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3464122 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3464123 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3464124 if we are more aggressive about this in childhood i think we can have an impact on what happens later in life and avoid some of these heart attacks and strokes in adulthood
3464125 iran will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights the countrys president said saturday scornful and smug about an informal deadline to stop expanding uranium enrichment or face more sanctions
3464126 mr villepin said iran must meet the october 31st deadline that the iaea imposed or face possible sanctions
3464127 in vienna austria where the iaea is based diplomats said iran faced a sept 3 deadline to stop uranium conversion
3464128 the united nations security council has given iran until the end of august to suspend uranium enrichment
3464129 the un has set today as a final deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment
3464130 the iranians did not give a clear answer if they dont give a clear answer then i think we will have no choice but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the security council
3464131 informed the israelis that the united states would oppose overflights of iraqi airspace to attack iran apparently the united states reassured the iraqi government after the iraqis strongly protested any potential violation of their sovereignty
3464132 but in case of tarique no such notice was served
3464133 if there was any allegation of income tax evasion the nbr would seek to recover that tax from him
3464134 the high court in an earlier hearing had ordered the nbr to collect tariques income tax but they took no steps to collect it
3464135 for this the demolition of rangs bhaban will be completed by november
3464136 the major portion of the demolition work is done to expedite the rest of the demolition work rajuk has imported machinery
3464137 we have already demolished nine buildings five more buildings will have to be knocked down by august 20 but there are court cases against demolition of nine others
3464138 we hope the court will not give any ruling that may hamper the governments good initiative
3464139 this is not true the plan has been changed to reduce the construction costs not to favour any special quarter
3464140 khaleda zia said the government has detained her on unfounded cases she will not apply for her release

3464159 one of the most original ideas in comics in stories of only a few pages each you will laugh repeatedly and still take away some universal truth to ponder over this is the type of book you will want to shove into the hands of everyone you know just to share the laugh
3464160 callens ability to point out the mundanity and absurdity of everyday life through his characters in a format accessable to young and old alike is continually heart warming thought provoking and hilarious
3464161 mark murphy has a clean classic drawing style perfectly suited to the time period tiki joe mysteries is awash in nostalgia for an era we know best from old movies and sinatra albums but he keeps his characters grounded it is a true period piece not grossly exaggerated camp
3464162 to my mind there is a sense of romance or perhaps innocence that postwar america was trying to capture when it emulated polynesian culture murphy said
3464163 as a premier banking institution pnb acts faithfully in accordance with its contractual obligation and continues to do so in matters which pertain to the recovered swiss funds the funds which are actually not missing are retained by pnb based on the agreement signed by former pcgg chair haydee yorac the retained funds will be turned over to pcgg after litigation is completed based on the said accord
3464164 in fact pnb was able to increase the net after tax value of the escrowed funds by 20 percent over the last five years when the 624 million of the total 658 million in swiss deposits was turned over to the government in 2004 upon orders of the supreme court
3464165 this crucial victory helped preserve the marcos funds and prevented its premature turnover to claimants of the marcos estate except in accordance with its mandate as escrow

3464167 we never manipulate religion one way or another we never used religion to advance a cause
3464168 it seems there are ethical problems the senate has not been remiss in its duty to remind chairman sabio about it
3464169 given his intervention coupled with coa findings on the missing 34 million sabio must go this is a classic case of money that was stolen not once but twice
3464170 were going to get the coa report and we want to look into that also gusto ko matapos muna ang sc investigation sc is doing a good job
3464171 no doubt this administration is after abs cbn no question about that obviously mr garcia has the full backing of gma because he is not asked to back off
3464172 the office of the ombudsman is an independent body pursuing its constitutional mandate above any personal or political consideration
3464173 the investigation on sen lacson is essentially just part of a fact finding investigation and not a fresh vilification move against him as alleged in some newspaper reports
3464174 in fact three other cases earlier filed against sen lacson were already closed and terminated after ombudsman investigators who conducted the fact finding probe did not find sufficient evidence to pursue the case
3464175 we cannot sacrifice lives here we have to take all the necessary precautions before things get worse
3464176 we are in close coordination with phivolcs for possible action to avoid unnecessary risk of lives should mayons condition deteriorate
3464177 mayon is really unpredictable based on history it changes conditions sometimes without prior signs of abnormality
3464178 we are maintaining mayons alert level at 1 we have yet to observe more abnormal parameters before we would consider raising its alert signal we cant see these precursors now yet
3464179 when it comes to counting im not fully satisfied with the speed we would have preferred that it was faster we were expecting all the reports to be in eight hours or so after the voting
3464180 we are a little reluctant to proclaim because of the 100 percent threshold maybe if theres a resolution lowering the threshold we can proclaim we dont want anything to mar anything
3464181 i understand that now it would cost less than p10 million we can request congress to give us that amount it is much cheaper now
3464182 if the cost of crude in the world market does not go up or if it goes down expect more fuel price rollbacks in the coming days
3464183 we will take the initiative to cut pump prices because we believe that if the cost of fuel is low that stimulates demand which in turn means good business for us
3464184 the coming november presidential elections in the united states will be a big factor the bush administration will do everything it can to keep prices down because high prices will not be good for administration candidates
3464185 you should review your figures i cannot believe that the government will lose money with this proposal
3464186 when the dollar appreciates oil prices go down as well as other commodities like gold they have been going down i think it is important to note that people can expect a reduction in oil prices soon a rollback soon
3464187 the katas ng vat is where projected windfall revenues from the vat on oil are to be channeled to projects that would help the poor cope with the rising oil and food prices
3464188 wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly wfp remains concerned over the growing number of persons displaced by the violence between the armed forces and the milf
3464189 many of the affected population are women and children and we are concerned for their well being and stand ready to support humanitarian needs we hope for peace so that these families can return to their communities
3464190 the refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
3464191 my family was told by the military to leave because they said moros muslims were advancing

3464208 stillers character tugg speedman is presented as a fading action hero who earlier failed in his bid for oscar glory while portraying simple jack a character with an intellectual disability speedmans portrayal of simple jack is featured as a movie within the movie
3464209 in character stiller speaks in a stilted stuttering adenoidal fashion and wears overalls bad false teeth and a classic institutional bowl haircut
3464210 early promotion of the film described simple jack as a
3464211 you hurt me a second time today mr stiller i am writing to tell you to hold you responsible i arrived home and saw on a website that it is now possible to buy tee shirts with the phrase full retard on it you are responsible for this mr stiller you wrote those words you chose those words you went public with those words it is you and only you who must bear the consequences for your actions
3464212 so enough stop the hurtful jokes talk to your children about language that is bullying and mean ask your friends your educators your religious leaders to help us to end the stubborn myth that people with intellectual disabilities are hopeless ask hollywood to get on the right side of dignity i hope others will join me in shutting this movie out of our lives and our pocketbooks we dont live in times when labeling and humiliating others is funny
3464213 i know god exists for you but you refuse to believe in him
3464214 if a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered he shall pay the girls father fifty shekels of silver he must marry the girl for he has violated her he can never divorce her as long as he lives
3464215 if there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man and another man finds her in the city and lies with her then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death the girl because she did not cry out in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbors wife thus you shall purge the evil from among you
3464216 with the fearful strain that is on me night and day if i did not laugh i should die

3464224 if you have been a member or ex member of the bnp or a known supporter or activist in anyway it is against the law to join the metropolitan police to me thats discrimination but the equal opportunities act doesnt cover that sort of discrimination everybody is complaining about me but nobody is shouting from the roof tops that bnp members are discriminated against in everyday life

3464309 das mobile internet gewinnt f r unsere kunden zunehmend an bedeutung und nimmt somit auch bei uns einen immer gr eren teil in der marketingplanung ein
3464310 als pionier in der entwicklung und dem einsatz des mobilen internets freuen wir uns sehr diesen attraktiven marketingkanal nun auch unseren affiliates zur verf gung stellen zu k nnen
3464311 laut unseren experten befragungen werden bis ende 2008 alle top 500 unternehmen eigene mobile portale unterhalten wir werden das dann auch pr fen
3464312 bis 2012 sollen nach sch tzungen der von uns befragten experten mehr als 10 prozent auf das mobile medium entfallen
3464313 mit 8 7 millionen umts f higen mobiltelefonen oder laptopkarten und einer steigerung der anzahl der regelm igen nutzer um 263 prozent von 2005 bis 2007 ist der knoten jetzt geplatzt und das mobile internet auf der berholspur
3464314 entscheidende faktoren des erfolgs sind nat rlich die netzabdeckung die bis zu 80 prozent der bev lkerung erreicht und die immer besser werdenden bertragungsgeschwindigkeiten von 3 bis 7 mbit pro sekunde eine wichtige rolle spielen die preissenkungen f r mobile datendienste sowie transparente tarifmodelle f r die datennutzung wie paket oder flatrateangebote
3464315 das mobile surfen und die daraus resultierenden interaktionsmedien sind im kommen das zeigen auch unsere untersuchungen die praktische reichweite betr gt 15 prozent was sich in etwa mit den zahlen der bundesnetzagentur deckt dennoch gibt es noch einiges zu tun um das mobile internet zu einem massenmedium zu entwickeln
3464316 von der eingabe von texten bis zu umst ndlichen installationsroutinen f r clients und anwendungen gibt es defizite bei der nutzerfreundlichkeit die die marktdynamik hemmen auch k nnte es noch mehr attraktive inhalte geben nur einige hundert unternehmen in deutschland verf gen ber portale die f r die mobile nutzung geeignet sind auch im mobilen internet gilt kunden suchen immer nach marken die sie aus einer anderen welt bereits kennen deshalb sind kooperationen der netzbetreiber mit google youtube und ebay als ein richtiger weg anzusehen um den nutzern zu signalisieren dass auch deren beliebte services mobil verf gbar sind

3464614 it is great to get the younger players from the academy to train with us and to expose them to the level that the seniors play at
3464615 we will try to blood them against bath and expose them to a quality side to see how they get on
3464616 they need to know how big a jump it is to the professional standard
3464617 they are three good young players and the academy players really are the future of the club
3464618 the mayor has ordered fire stations closed state workers are being faced with the threat of being paid the minimum wage and unemployment is reaching record highs
3464619 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3464620 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3464621 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3464622 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3464623 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3464624 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3464625 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3464626 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3464627 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3464628 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3464629 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3464630 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3464631 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3464632 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today
3464633 what i get irritated about is they have tournaments on mothers or fathers day
3464634 i may sound crazy saying im doing this so my son can play high school ball and then college ball and maybe move on from there but were devoted to our kids
3464635 not only are kids getting into it earlier but theres a huge market with pitching hitting speed and agility lessons and everybodys swinging a worth prodigy lithium bat that costs 200
3464636 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3464637 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it
3464638 to a certain extent its been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and im not so sure thats good
3464639 there is no way you can protect those kids arms
3464640 absolutely unlike any documentary youve ever seen step into liquid nearly qualifies as a religious experience
3464641 im not able to give the team what it needs so its best for me to step down
3464642 this is not the way i intended for things to turn out
3464643 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3464644 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3464645 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3464646 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3464647 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3464648 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3464649 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3464650 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3464651 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3464652 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3464653 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3464654 my guess is that the obama campaign understands that and they know its not enough to be ahead

3464657 i was so happy after i won but i didnt know whether to cry smile or jump up and down
3464658 after my performances in the last two olympics i really wanted to come here and bring home a medal for the u s this is definitely one of the greatest moments of my life so far
3464659 i got off to a bad start and couldnt really figure out what i was doing wrong
3464660 i came here to win my goal wasnt just to make the team i am disappointed but hats off to glenn who is not only my teammate but a good friend
3464661 it was a little rough i had to work very hard just to accomplish what i did today i didnt have any expectations going in to the match i just went in and tried to execute each shot as well as i could
3464662 one of my classes is actually in a kindergarten closet this year so we can joke around about that
3464663 well pull together for any event we have coming toward us each event will be special
3464664 the new c 145 will be able to have a parent or family member go with our crew back to the hospital
3464665 dont start another quilt until the one im working on is finished
3464666 hello and thank you for being so kind when i was stung by a bee please stop staring at my knobby knees
3464667 it would be nice if we didnt have quite as much moving as we have had in there or if we controlled more of it but again its always unfortunate when someone cant practice or someone is not available
3464668 every time that happens it provides an opportunity for someone else we just have to do what we can do and dont worry about what we cant do we will do what we can do that means some guys have moved around some guys are gaining a little bit more position flexibility
3464669 so they know enough about those areas to be able to go out and do a good assessment
3464670 we have another team that just departed to go to the combined joint task force horn of africa
3464671 theyre going over there to do a 45 day pre deployment site survey in preparation for a commitment where well send two teams in december for a six month deployment
3464672 we need to be out way ahead of the ship so we can establish those relationships that we need and we can liaison with civil authorities there
3464673 and we can find out where they need help and where we can give help
3464674 i think over the next five to 10 years youre going to see this force grow and become more widely known and more widely used
3464675 and its going to become a strong force for our national defense
3464676 before you start yelling at me and blaming me for it lets figure this out
3464677 well there was an attitude the second i picked up the phone
3464678 before i can walk in anothers shoes i must first remove my own
3464679 who are you old man and what did you do with mike
3464680 in my mind he was the dean of nashville musicians
3464681 he served at the foundational level for the family of country music
3464682 i cant help it if im still in love with you
3464683 there werent a lot of stylists who were inimitable and he certainly was and he never lost any skills throughout his life he played exactly like he did in the 1940s and 50s
3464684 id go get that guitar and hand him his picks and hed play walkin after midnight and cold cold heart and just freeze me to death
3464685 he was playing that thing and i thought man what a way to have fun

3464687 when he would tell stories about hank hed sometimes well up with emotion
3464688 his goal was to keep playing hank williams songs until he died

3464699 a phrase used in a sarcastic annoying tone when you dont want to tell something to someone
3464700 action of an adventure game with the challenge of a puzzle game
3464701 i am well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps
3464702 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3464703 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3464704 in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3464705 i want to stress that last point because there is no denying it the system failed
3464706 the active wrongdoing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3464707 i have made repeatedly clear in both private meetings with department employees and in public appearances that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3464708 two wrongs do not make a right the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong
3464709 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations
3464710 its good to see amd ati back in the high performance game
3464711 the new card looks like it will be able to deliver the goods to high end gamers a lucrative and desirable market moreover amds single card but dual gpu 4870 x2 can if early reviews are on target outperform dual card configurations from nvidia
3464712 the payoff is that this puts amd in the enviable position of having both the highest performance video card and the less expensive solution an experience they havent enjoyed for a while
3464713 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3464714 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3464715 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3464716 im not aware of any of those kinds of specific requests
3464717 im not going to get into the range of things that may or may not be considered
3464718 the first part of this is to make sure the shooting stops and that forces return to their previous positions so we can get in there and help this population and a get a dialogue started

3464722 it is all about matchups and styles i beat the current world championship world champion in the semifinals and fought the girl who lost to that girl in the finals
3464723 but her style was not good for me and i ended up losing so a lot of it is by the luck of the draw a lot of it is how good of a day you have but most of it is about how you train
3464724 it is definitely challenging for sure but it is meant to be that way i qualified the berth for the olympics for women in september at the world championships so that is pretty motivating realizing i can hold my ground against the top international paddlers
3464725 we were very disappointed at the vote last time to eliminate the sport with the vote coming up in 2009 we feel that our performance in the 2008 olympics will go a long way baseball needs to be in the olympics

3464730 of course im still comfortable with it its still my forecast
3464731 its not true just in the united states its true in europe in terms of slowing growth that being said what weve seen in the last nine months is our business being pretty normal
3464732 atom is off to a very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
3464733 its the perfect recession product to have in the marketplace
3464734 drill now so well never have to look at alternatives
3464735 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3464736 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3464737 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3464738 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3464739 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3464740 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3464741 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it

3464753 when we stayed in the basement of the mansion i noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune i sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it
3464754 then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife i gave him the cow instead things arent always what they seem

3464757 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marxist black liberation theology preached by wright
3464758 we are thrilled to have leah daughtry leading our 2008 democratic convention team
3464759 i am honored to be a part of this exciting endeavor
3464760 like wright daughtry is in your face about her activism

3464770 this forum allowed our students to hear career advice from presenters it was great for our students to interact with these diverse professionals our students appreciated their candidness with past struggles challenges and successes one of the most beneficial outcomes of this forum was the realization that students do not have to be certain about a career path at this point
3464771 the new partnership with nortel learnit has provided the opportunity to have real world experiences and career advice brought into the educational environment as our students transition into high school it has been beneficial for students to hear how to set goals and develop a path to achieve their goals our students left the session with valuable information that will hopefully lead to successful futures

3464853 certainly it is not too much to ask a gunmaker not to hire drug addicts with criminal records to work in its unsecured manufacturing plant

3464902 commercial sex worker is a term i learned recently at an aids conference held at the harvard school of public health at first i chuckled thinking that a prissy professor was trying to avoid the use of offensive words in public but as i thought about it further i realized it as a better term than the usual synonyms because particularly in the context of aids it can refer to either sex

3464913 it happens more on a night shift because you dont have visitors coming in and out you dont have phones ringing so therefore theres more time for either the staff nurse or the care assistant if he or she wants to sleep that they do have an opportunity to do that
3464914 i have been on a night shift where the staff nurse has perhaps slept for five or six hours
3464915 i have gone into a home where residents have sat in the same pad and diarrhoea perhaps has been spilling out over the top of that incontinence pad and it has been very obvious to me that no one has thought to changing that persons incontinent pad so he or she could have sat there for seven eight or nine hours theyre bound to have sores on their bottoms and i have noticed this as well
3464916 i was in a nursing home and i was putting the man to bed and his pad was very very wet and i thought that pad hasnt been changed in a long time so the pad i put on him in the morning i put an x on it
3464917 when i was putting him to bed the next night that pad was the same pad id put on in the morning
3464918 when ive worked in nursing homes i would see the other carers using cleaning wipes thats for hard surfaces so you can imagine what that would do to peoples bottoms
3464919 ive worked with people who dont even put an apron and gloves on
3464920 they go into and work with that person who has c diff they dont even wash their hands they come out and they go to another resident so like no wonder you know its spreading so fast

3465030 we have a month and a half to think about how we are going to get to the test series against australia still a lot of time to think and reflect on what went wrong here
3465031 after this series a couple of the seniors will certainly give it a thought about what happened in sri lanka its their call whether to stay and compete or gracefully retire

3465293 i am proud to be part of a government that is working to reduce the damaging effects of illicit drugs on our youth and on our communities
3465294 our collaboration with the provinces territories and support agencies help provide youth the support they need to make smart choices and steer clear of illicit drugs and drug related crime
3465295 we cannot build safer communities without addressing the needs of young people with addiction issues
3465296 this initiative is part of a broader provincial strategy to treat youth with substance abuse problems by treating addiction we believe we can reduce reoffending and stop the progress of youth offenders into the adult justice system we appreciate the federal governments continued support as we work together to reduce youth addiction and crime

3465312 the behind the scenes portion of follow limiting varies by account relationship and changes over time based on current behavior in the twitter community weve concluded that this is both fair and reasonable
3465313 until you follow fewer people or more people follow you
3465314 while we figure out what works best for everyone the limits may change occasionally
3465315 but this is the nucleus and future limits will be based upon the success of these

3465331 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3465332 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3465333 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine

3465339 is this what we want to see in our streets why would anyone think that we should be at war with such nice peaceful kittens americans need to know you need to forward this one to everyone these pictures tell it all kittens have stated that england will be the first country they take over these are pictures not shown on american tv or in american newspapers as they might help bushs war on kittens but were forwarded by a canadian who thought americans ought to know
3465340 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3465341 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3465342 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3465343 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3465344 through our sources we have learnt that three persons have been detained at jeddah and we are in the process of establishing their identity through our sources however we are awaiting official confirmation in this regard
3465345 in current times this is also a good way to ensure continuous flow of income
3465346 the rise in lending rates will impact the future growth of the bank but a strong corporate credit portfolio will still help maintaining 15 16 per cent growth in the overall credit for the financial year
3465347 compared to the last year there is a slowdown in the credit offtake in small ticket loans across the industry

3465354 the councils 2004 transfer research showed one of the main barriers to transfer is a lack of information about how to plan and prepare to transfer

3465358 however if they concentrate on selected crop species then the management and crop selection practices may affect crop diversity
3465359 the search for these new varieties maintains and supports their livelihoods by having ready access to plant products necessary for their survival and to insure against unanticipated economic and environmental changes
3465360 there is therefore need to replace lost varieties which may occur due to war situations famine weather changes pests and diseases
3465361 while they observe the new varieties they select some with favourable characteristics for future planting while eliminating those with inferior qualities these techniques exert selection pressure on crops and quickly eliminate characteristics not desired by farmers while amplifying those liked by farmers a case in point is the big pod and seed sizes generally this process of experimentation and selection may cause a rapid loss of important and beneficial genes because they are associated and found in individuals with inferior characteristics

3465377 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation

3465379 as embedded computing systems in military and aerospace applications become increasingly powerful the amount of heat they dissipate also increases creating a real challenge to cool them sufficiently to ensure reliable operation
3465380 this agreement allows us to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the spraycool chassis and extend our product offering to serve the needs of customers requiring very high performance subsystem solutions from a single source
3465381 we are very excited about working with ge fanuc intelligent platforms

3465396 in the past people had more food but lacked technology when foreigners came they brought technology and their crops
3465397 the foreigners took samples of our seeds and kept them intact they then picked a few and developed them and returned them to us each time they would bring a little for a few people who would then discard our traditional seeds because the alien seeds were fast maturing and had high yields
3465398 at first their seeds would last three seasons but went on reducing until now when we cant use last seasons harvest to plant we must now buy from the foreigners each time we want to plant
3465399 i have been on cbs radio and in farmers shows in uganda and kenya
3465400 i need assistance to preserve these traditional crops on my garden and also facilitation to educate farmers
3465401 so if cultural leaders spearhead the preservation of these crops the task would reduce
3465402 many farmers are peasants and cant afford to buy seeds from shops
3465403 so they dont plant anything and as such can never have enough food
3465404 the reason for the disappearing crop species is due to the introduction of hybrid seeds many farmers think that after harvest they can keep the seeds for planting for hybrid someone has to buy seeds every year or seasonally due to its composition hybrid has two varieties which do not allow it to grow so they are not supposed to save the seeds
3465405 the problem is our farmers have preferences for certain crops they want to grow because they grow very quickly and they are easier to handle
3465406 some crops are not on the farms but they can be found in other zones they disappear due to weather and climate changes for example the multi coloured maize is rare these days because of its low yields in certain places but you can find it other places
3465407 they benefit from new and improved seed crops how can they at the same time promote our traditional crops
3465408 weve leveraged the unparalleled tuning and receiving capabilities of our echotek products into a growing number of embedded cots based network centric computing solutions for our customers

3465424 the next government should be a government of national consensus with the inclusion of nepali congress
3465425 interviewees stated that the vast bulk of social science research in east africa is commissioned by ngos or government departments mostly funded from the north consequently it is highly applied and determined by external priorities the few opportunities for academic research were said to come primarily from northern researchers who win the funding resulting in unbalanced collaborations
3465426 these seem to divert university staff from academic research supporting colleagues and training the next generation of researchers stunt the institutional capacity of university departments restrict the sharing of research findings and perpetuate donors control of the research agenda
3465427 in makerere you can spend your entire time just working on very well paid short term consultancy studies for ngos who want something done in three weeks and will pay you very well
3465428 in one research institute consultancies augment salaries range from around 400 month to about 5 000

3465442 this is pure intimidation of the press the public is entitled to know
3465443 they businessmen are becoming immune the regime helps them get out of disasters and whitewashes them
3465444 you feel like you should have a bit of a lead at that point
3465445 we dominated the second period territorially and on the shot clock but we gave up a goal the first shift of the third
3465446 we were playing well and just wanted to stick to the gameplan
3465447 every time weve faced a little bit of adversity so far our game has gotten better
3465448 whether weve cleaned up our defensive zone or smartened up through the neutral zone with decisions and found a way to extend the lead weve done that its a good characteristic to have
3465449 if you lose once youre not going to play for the gold
3465450 there are a lot of patients out there who are taking statins who could save a lot of money by splitting a larger tablet or perhaps even moving to a lower cost statin and splitting a larger tablet of that statin and save even more money
3465451 typically the difference between a split tablet where theres a little bit more on one half of the tablet than on the next fragment it cant possibly make any meaningful difference in terms of the drugs effect
3465452 but it definitely can to the users pocketbook its very much like buying any other commodity in bulk whether you buy cereal or flower or rice or sugar most people will buy it in a larger size
3465453 if one is going to take a drug for a few weeks say an antibiotic if you pay 35 compared with 10 its not usually a big deal
3465454 but if youre going to take it for years or potentially the rest of your life its a huge deal where the cash out of your pocket is after tax income
3465455 yes its absolutely wonderful if youre looking at drugs where you dont need the exact exact exact dose where you can be off by a little bit and its fine
3465456 absolutely industry knows about this and theyre definitely thinking ok what do we do about it

3465473 george is pro palestinian and he is also urging barack to withdraw unconditionally from iraq if he wins
3465474 his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george
3465475 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
3465476 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad
3465477 he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
3465478 we vuurden wel degelijk vuurpijlen af om de sporen te maken maar ze waren door de mist niet goed zichtbaar
3465479 daarom kan het wel zijn dat eerder gedraaide beelden zijn gebruikt om dat probleem op te lossen

3465481 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3465482 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3465483 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3465484 wed rather just be putting gasoline in the ground and letting our customers fill up their tanks but were in a situation where we dont have the volume of gasoline that we normally do
3465485 were getting our hands on any trucks we can to source product internationally and locally
3465486 if a russia which misjudges its power and its capacities embarks now on a blatantly nationalistic and imperialistic course we will all suffer
3465487 i walk and i do yoga but not the strenuous hardcore ashtanga style often i just breathe and sit in one position for ages its for relaxation the most vigorous exercise i do is running around after bluebell

3465490 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3465491 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3465492 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3465493 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3465494 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3465495 he has been forced to withdraw its a military blunder it caused an international incident
3465496 we are receiving only moral and humanitarian help from the international community but we need more than that
3465497 an attempt of repeated occupation and enslavement of georgia depriving our country of its independence is underway
3465498 russias goal is to put an end to the existence of the georgian state
3465499 possibly they thought they could move quickly enough to present the russians with a fait accompli
3465500 the heart of the matter is a miscalculation that the russians would not react at the level they reacted and push back as they did
3465501 a lot of the crockery is broken and hes greatly weakened hes made his political pledge to return these territories to georgia nearly impossible
3465502 text notification via wireless devices and desktop computer notification are effective means for delivering mass notification messages to multiple recipient groups
3465503 desktop notification is particularly effective when more complex information must be conveyed and can be a cost effective interim solution prior to installing an individual building mns
3465504 stimulate development of suitable requirements and standards for dod installations
3465505 the dod has led the adoption of network based emergency alerting systems beginning to deploy them as early as 2004 in fact more than 130 dod facilities already use athoc iwsalerts to protect approximately one million people
3465506 though some of the individual military services already have regulations in place requiring network alerting functionality the newly amended ufc raises the importance of network centric alerting and signals maturation of the market it also paves the way for wide adoption of this capability across the dod
3465507 the ufc committee has done a great job adapting mass notification requirements to embrace modern ip network technologies their guidance will impact the dod and other government and commercial organizations requiring emergency alerting systems for example the ufc impacts standards for organizations such as the national fire protection association nfpa the primary authority on fire prevention and public safety which today provides guidance for mass notification systems and their relationship to fire protection systems the nfpa is currently working on moving the network centric alerting recommendations into mandated code for mass notification to private sector commercial projects
3465508 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3465509 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3465510 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3465511 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3465512 we are still going to get beat up on this one way or another
3465513 they expect to make sacrifices and they choose to make sacrifices
3465514 your job is to try to moderate some of those differences
3465515 unless you have a spouse who works full time or you are retired its difficult to serve
3465516 my comment was not meant to be gender specific and i in no way intended it to be interpreted in that way
3465517 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3465518 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3465519 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3465520 youre not building for the future here this is a candidate whos lost provincially lost federally and is what 62 63 years old
3465521 60 years old is not fit to start a career in politics
3465522 yes i stand by the comments that i made but not the comments that are attributed to me the intent that idiots like marjory lebreton would put onto my comments
3465523 marjory should go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3465524 i dont think the conflict will have big consequences at least if it doesnt escalate
3465525 the main problem for russia is that investor perception which was already low will deteriorate even further
3465526 the very fact of the conflict is not putting investors in the mood to invest in russia
3465527 the events themselves of course have an influence on the outflow of capital but they cant significantly change the fundamentals
3465528 russia is a very strong country in terms of economic development
3465529 the country is trying to enter the world trade organization and this armed conflict with georgia will make that process even more difficult
3465530 the conflict with georgia empowers the hardliners in russia economic reform in russia will be delayed
3465531 russia is an immediate neighbor you cant wish it doesnt exist
3465532 i dont think europeans will say we dont want to have to do anything with this country but europeans will think we trusted too much that russia would become more like a western country
3465533 theres no doubt that whats happening has increased the investment risk within georgia and the region
3465534 this is one more step by the russians trying to increase their power among their former satellites that raises questions over further foreign investment in georgia as well as countries like azerbaijan and ukraine
3465535 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3465536 victimised by the fighters and then be victimised by the men that you love
3465537 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3465538 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her
3465539 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3465540 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3465541 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of

3465573 implementing the biggest immigration program since the end of wwii and the biggest intake in absolute numbers of permanent immigrants and temporary workers in australias history
3465574 in the short run it transfers wealth from one group workers to another employers
3465575 how does the panel think current migration policy matches our carbon emissions aspirations
3465576 we are currently experiencing the first plague of humans in the history of the planet more immigration means we have to share what little is left with more more aussies means we more poor aussies only economic sustainability and population stability will save us doug you ideas are outdated and dangerous i would like to see zero immigration so that i dont have to give up more of my share

3465581 it happens more on a night shift because you dont have visitors coming in and out you dont have phones ringing so therefore theres more time for either the staff nurse or the care assistant if he or she wants to sleep that they do have an opportunity to do that
3465582 i have been on a night shift where the staff nurse has perhaps slept for five or six hours
3465583 i have gone into a home where residents have sat in the same pad and diarrhoea perhaps has been spilling out over the top of that incontinence pad and it has been very obvious to me that no one has thought to changing that persons incontinent pad so he or she could have sat there for seven eight or nine hours theyre bound to have sores on their bottoms and i have noticed this as well
3465584 i was in a nursing home and i was putting the man to bed and his pad was very very wet and i thought that pad hasnt been changed in a long time so the pad i put on him in the morning i put an x on it
3465585 when i was putting him to bed the next night that pad was the same pad id put on in the morning
3465586 when ive worked in nursing homes i would see the other carers using cleaning wipes thats for hard surfaces so you can imagine what that would do to peoples bottoms
3465587 ive worked with people who dont even put an apron and gloves on
3465588 they go into and work with that person who has c diff they dont even wash their hands they come out and they go to another resident so like no wonder you know its spreading so fast

3465590 the offenders will use numerous profiles and clearly the offenders can adapt to whatever storyline they choose
3465591 in essence they will become the perfect partner for whatever kind of victim they are targeting
3465592 in this instance the offenders are targeting single mothers and widows who are seeking new partners for long term relationships and marriage it is a cruel and deliberate offence feeding on someones dreams of a happy ending sadly this is never the case
3465593 they should be very cautious about anyone that is asking them for money or emotionally encouraging them for financial assistance
3465594 our best efforts are to disrupt their criminal networks and alert the public as a crime prevention measure
3465595 id seen the show a shot at love and just needed to meet her and it just happened

3465607 there are certainly procedures in place to get a new candidate in watford clearly what this individual did was completely unacceptable he is no longer the candidate he is no longer a member of the party and we will work very hard to make sure that conservatives in watford can choose a really good candidate to challenge that seat
3465608 its only through that three dimensional approach that we can get to grips with the problems on our streets and the fear in our society in the end it is stable homes good values taught in the home that is the best way to tackle crime in the long term
3465609 there are a number of positions that only require 12 months of education to get an associate degree in fields that the business community says it needs right now
3465610 it has a direct economic impact it impacts crime and it impacts the family
3465611 i too think this is a better use of the money in terms of the scholarship money that you proposed early on i think this is a better use
3465612 i agree that education is the key thats part of the problem we have in the city but theres a second half to that problem weve got to create jobs when these people get educated theyve got to have a place to work
3465613 our relationship with georgia is more important so that russia will have influence over the whole south caucuses just as it has for centuries

3465641 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
3465642 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
3465643 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
3465644 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
3465645 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
3465646 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
3465647 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
3465648 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
3465649 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
3465650 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
3465651 wait this is a ghost cop hes probably buried in that graveyard over there and his spirit wanders the highway he needs to do this till he reaches a certain number of tickets so his soul can rest
3465652 yes i got these tickets but i was under the impression that the cop was a ghost so i didnt have to pay them my brother told me that ghost tickets dont count
3465653 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing

3465656 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3465657 people are somewhat brand loyal but people tend to look for the lower price so at this point another factor in their decision making may be well they have gas and they dont so theyll go there
3465658 most of our animals are heading to juba because traders there pay highly
3465659 pig and chicken farmers are suffering because the price of feeds is high when you add the cost of veterinary drugs you get a real problem
3465660 it is difficult to sell a 2kg hen at shs15 000 because nobody will buy
3465661 we are not seriously affected by the high cost of animal feeds because we make our own mr tom zijja from balawoli farmers association said he was among the exhibitors at the kamuli stall in jinja
3465662 we can sell our birds at a very good price in kampala and jinja
3465663 i had done well and raised up to 70 pigs but i was forced to sell them because i could no longer afford to feed them
3465664 i had to sell at a low price because pigs just like chicken can die off quickly
3465665 the high cost of feeds is forcing poultry and pig farmers from business because they cant afford to maintain the farms
3465666 the few who have birds and pigs sell the products at a very high price but this is bad because very few people can afford the eggs or chicken and so the businesses may collapse
3465667 apart from the high cost of fish feeds the cost of implements also affects fishing
3465668 fishnet manufacturers have stopped producing small nets used to protect ponds from birds and frogs so we have to buy expensive imported nets
3465669 a kilo of fish feed from sekalala industries costs shs1 500 while that from bolton costs between shs2 000 and shs2 500
3465670 recently unauthorized chris brown material was leaked online most of the unfinished songs were demos and reference tracks brown and his production team were writing and producing for other artists browns record label jive records is doing everything possible to prevent any further illegal distribution of these tracks

3465673 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3465674 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3465675 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3465676 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3465677 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3465678 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3465679 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3465680 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3465681 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys

3465690 estamos fortaleciendo nuestras capacidades nacionales queremos impulsar la materia cient fica tecnol gica pues ciertamente la ciencia y la tecnolog a est en todo nuestro acontecer diario
3465691 la ciencia y la tecnolog a forman parte de nuestra cotidianidad
3465692 contamos con 23 redes socialistas de innovaci n productiva lo que nos permite que los productores no solamente se articulen entre ellos sino que propendan hacia la apropiaci n del conocimiento de forma que les sirva como herramienta para constituirse m s adelante en lo que ser an las empresas productoras socialistas estas redes significan el semillero para cambiar ese estilo capitalista y crear una cultura m s humana
3465693 la gente al principio cre a que la ciencia y la tecnolog a era patrimonio de los pa ses m s desarrollados y de una c pula social que ten a el privilegio de manejar los recursos ahora es necesario apropiarse de la ciencia como un quehacer diario y cotidiano el impacto social es absoluto y determinante para el desarrollo de una conciencia en el uso de la ciencia y la tecnolog a
3465694 el brazo fundamental de la ciencia y la tecnolog a son las comunidades por ello las instituciones del estado deben trabajar por un mismo fin asegur gonz lez
3465695 nuestros fines est n dirigidos a que se cumpla lo que el mppct puede ejecutar dentro de las comunidades hay un mundo de saberes que es preciso tomar en cuenta y el ministerio lo est haciendo

3465702 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3465703 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3465704 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect

3465746 the islamic revolutionary guards corps has recently tested a naval weapon with a 300 km range in which no vessel would be safe and would be sent to the depths
3465747 the design and production technology used in this weapon is completely indigenous to iran and has never been employed by any other country
3465748 is there anything more ridiculous than politicians apologizing for historical events

3465754 perhaps it will show that the justice department was being unlawfully and politically manipulated he appears to grant and then he went on to say that he would oppose any effort to hold those who attempted to politicize the justice department to account
3465755 the crowd was visibly angered at mukaseys speech and his reception was ice cold throughout
3465756 ok so maybe we got caught politicizing the justice department but well use our political control of the justice department to block any accountability for the perpetrators
3465757 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3465758 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3465759 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3465760 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3465761 to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3465762 he is showing a complete lack of respect for the rule of law by not charging individuals who were part of the united states justice department that broke the law
3465763 he is creating a class of individuals that are above the law in this country and that is wrong they should be tried for the crimes they committed but mr mukasey told the aba they are going to get off scott free
3465764 these doj employees broke the law it doesnt matter where they work ignorance to the law is no excuse plus the evidence suggests these folks knew what they were doing and broke the law anyway they should be tried and if convicted punished for their crimes
3465765 yet mr mukasey wants to sweep it under his rug and forget it by refusing to do his job he is part and parcel of the crime
3465766 mr mukasey made a very big mistake saying he will not charge these individuals he will lose the respect of people around this world as this story is carried all over the world the message around the world will be if you work for the department of justice in the united states of america and break the law you wont be charged what kind of message is that
3465767 have we no respect any longer in the department of justice for the rule of law
3465768 it sounds like mr mukasey has no respect what is our president doing allowing this guy to run the doj he took an oath to uphold the law he should do so
3465769 if he cannot then the president should fire mr mukasey his job after all is to uphold the rule of law and treat all citizens the same surely we are not now going to make a new class of citizens that are above the law
3465770 i am calling on the president of the united states of america to restore the rule of law in this country after all our attorney general seems to have forgotten what his job is
3465771 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one

3465803 una mala mentalidad por pensar que el partido estaba ganado antes de jugarlo
3465804 empezamos con muy mala mentalidad porque nos dejamos envolver por el ambiente de que ganamos a grecia en el primer partido que china hab a perdido con los estados unidos y ya pens bamos que hab amos ganado a china salimos sin intensidad y eso nos dur todo el primer tiempo
3465805 en el descanso reflexionamos sobre eso se habl de que china pod a ganar y la actitud del equipo cambi china jug un partido extraordinario
3465806 estoy muy contento por la victoria porque esto nos acerca la clasificaci n y estar entre los cuatro primeros del grupo es nuestro objetivo
3465807 sab amos que era un equipo muy complicado y que si se ponen a jugar y a encestar tienen calidad lo que pasa es que han metido m s de lo que esper bamos nosotros no hemos tenido nuestro mejor d a y casi tenemos no un desastre pero s un traspi s
3465808 perdido nunca se da un partido hasta que se acaba pero lo he visto complicado por momentos pero hemos sabido sacarlo adelante que lo importante y la nota positiva
3465809 el que nos ha hecho da o no ha sido yao han sido los dem s yao ha metido diez puntos o as los que nos han hecho da o son los de fuera que han tirado muy bien y sobre todo que nosotros no hemos tenido el d a
3465810 se puso muy mal al final del tercer cuarto estaba la cosa muy fea pero somos un equipo que podemos ponernos en situaciones de este tipo y no es la primera vez que lo demostramos
3465811 ellos han estado muy acertados han corrido mucho al contraataque nosotros hemos perdido la confianza porque no nos sal an las cosas en defensa y en ataque est bamos fallando cosas f ciles mientras ellos met an triples o canastas importantes y hemos ido perdiendo la confianza pero cuando la hemos recuperado ya hemos conseguido remontar
3465812 i knew it would be touch and go i knew i had to get third or fourth no less than that to get through

3465814 with power prices going through the roof why are we not amalgamating the power companies created during the mindless national party reforms
3465815 this bill will deliver cheaper power prices for the consumer it will start with the split of ecnz with the baby ecnzs contact energy and the private generators we will have true competition in this country for wholesale electricity innovation and efficiency will come in and the price will go down the splitting of the lines and the energy business will ensure that the price will go through to the consumer at a lower level that will be a win win situation for the consumer
3465816 the push for back to school shopping is so relentless in our society
3465817 we decided this would be the perfect time to do a swap
3465818 we are hoping to alleviate the pressure on families to spend money they might not have and to buy things they dont need or want
3465819 there is definitely pressure applied to consume to over extend and it is our hope that we can help people realize that its way more fun and creative to share what is already out there and for each person to define their own style thereby making the idea of hand me downs and clothes swapping cool in the eyes of the kids and green in the eyes of our planet
3465820 i think austin has a lot of creative and environmentally minded people people who are now having children of their own
3465821 they want their kids to know how to be makers to be creative thinkers and to think of doing things in a green way the idea of reduce reuse recycle is becoming more and more crucial and for this next generation especially just a way of life
3465822 its my first olympics so its good to get away to a good start
3465823 in the second race i just went out there to be consistent and do what i do well sail the boat well
3465824 but im not silly enough to think im doing well yet
3465825 i know theres a long way to go in this regatta
3465826 its the olympics and you are with a team in the village and obviously they arent going to give me a hard time but its nice to make others proud and to win for new zealand and when you dont its tough
3465827 today i didnt come out strong and she came out better she was firing away
3465828 i think its that she wanted it so badly she wanted to get a win here at the olympics and she was trying too hard
3465829 o lord protect these sisters whom i cannot protect now
3465830 in general its new zealand businesses which are not performing obviously to where we would have expected mainly because of the deterioration of the macro environment there that weve seen through the half
3465831 i wouldnt hold your breath about any major acquisitions but at the same time if the right opportunities present themselves wed be interested
3465832 were hopeful of some help later this year for sure next year but were not making any firm predictions at this stage
3465833 theres growth coming through from other areas such as outdoor and their australian publishing business which is offsetting that weakness in new zealand
3465834 were very determined to keep a lid on our costs
3465835 if you are going to take a profile in a public company and charging in from the outside then youd think they would front up to show off their wares
3465836 such a display of human pride and exuberance closely resembles the dominance displays of chimps and monkeys which also feature outstretched arms and exaggerated postures i wish i could watch the olympics on a non us tv channel
3465837 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate in style
3465838 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her
3465839 she views this as a sign she should postpone the birthday bash and play it by ear instead
3465840 madonna now thinks it will go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month

3465847 having this completed pool makes us happier than not having the big hole

3465888 hello blah blah blah my names jonny how can i help
3465889 ive just had an engineer here and he walked off without finishing the job
3465890 ok was it because he didnt have any digiboxes or
3465891 well my wife has just had a baby and when the engineer arrived and knocked on my door i told him this
3465892 he went straight to the sky box he didnt once stop to see the baby just walked right past leaving fluff from his socks on the carpet
3465893 well he was trying to do his work and then he asked if he could use the toilet
3465894 my wife and i dont like other people using our toilet its not very hygenic to let someone else use your toilet is it
3465895 ok so let me cut this short what did the engineer say
3465896 nothing after my wife shouted at him he just walked off got his shoes and went and still never saw the baby
3465897 how many times do i have to tell you to turn right
3465898 i will lock you and the dog in the trunk of my car for two hours at the end of that time i will open the trunk and see which one of you is happiest to see me she had no comment
3465899 retail financial results impacted by extraordinary weather and market conditions in ercot
3465900 we have made very good progress implementing our strategic priorities and are well positioned in light of current market conditions
3465901 during the quarter the retail business delivered disappointing financial results driven by extreme weather and transmission constraints in the texas electricity market while these factors impact our 2008 results we believe we have taken the necessary steps to reduce their potential magnitude going forward reliant energy continues to offer a robust value proposition and expects to generate significant free cash flow
3465902 however given the challenges we face in restoring financial health to our pnm utility subsidiary we believe first choice power could have more value to another market participant
3465903 the state should resist efforts to re regulate the market and instead adopt the recommendations in this plan while retaining the oversight of the puc and ercot over the market

3465909 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers

3465911 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs

3465914 every bomb that falls over our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
3465915 ever wonder what politicians really think about while theyre taping commercials
3465916 and ive spent millions trying to get elected to something
3465917 here is how it works in washington the politicians get millions in campaign cash the special interests get what they want and we get the short end of the stick mitch mcconnell is the master of this system
3465918 its how big oil gets billions in tax breaks and we get four dollars a gallon gas its how wall street gets bailed out and people lose their homes
3465919 its how senators get indicted and mitch mcconnell says nothing
3465920 did anyone see me going into my oil lobbyist fundraiser
3465921 ill bet those suckers at home dont know i make huge profits investing in oil

3465937 the only subject that was discussed seriously was the borders but we never reached an agreement the gap is still as wide as ever
3465938 this plan is totally unacceptable because we insisted to the israelis that the border can only be on the basis of 1967

3465950 its very disappointing because im shooting as good as ive ever shot
3465951 im ranked third in the world and i was a serious medal contender to go out there and just lose it in one day thats the olympics you wait four years and hope its your day unfortunately it wasnt i ran into some problems with my game and just didnt have time to fix them
3465952 in conjunction with usa shooting im trying to develop some more junior camps
3465953 weve got to fill the gap weve got to bring somebody up to replace us old guys
3465954 i seriously made up my mind that this was it

3465964 plus i dont sleep feel or function well when i get that worked up
3465965 lets see its 2008 and the problem is this and so what i need is a plan that will have the greatest chance of solving the problem and also represent my self according to my values
3465966 hes got a great fastball great curve ball and his change up is a plus pitch
3465967 it just seemed like he wasnt on his a game and we were able to take advantage of that
3465968 im locating my fastball now and that makes things a little easier for me
3465969 we played like youd like to see about 95 games a year
3465970 we pitched well we hit the ball in key situations and we played some good defence
3465971 i want to wrap this up its been 15 years im ready to get it over with one way or the other i dont care what the outcome is i just want the attorneys to do their business so i can do mine
3465972 i completely understand the financial constraints the airline industry is in but i also know the military traveler is an extremely small fraction of the total passengers carried
3465973 those who wear the uniform today are a special class of citizen who enables everyone else to enjoy every liberty our great country holds dear they deserve special treatment because they have earned it
3465974 what i am requesting is for your member airlines to begin allowing all military personnel traveling on orders to check a third bag without being charged
3465975 this should not be a difficult decision to reach but it is one that needs to be made
3465976 long and proud history of supporting our nations military men and women
3465977 they routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3465978 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3465979 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3465980 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3465981 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3465982 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3465983 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3465984 our street is not a thoroughfare even though the truckers like to think it is
3465985 in pinal county there is a wide range of homes available from the listed homes to foreclosures but a key force driving the sales activity has been the rapidly declining prices
3465986 homeowners and investors are buying with the expectation of strong appreciation in the future

3465990 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3465991 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3465992 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3465993 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3465994 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3465995 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3465996 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3465997 today was a big win for us a big win
3465998 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3465999 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3466000 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3466001 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3466002 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3466003 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3466004 testimoniamos unas elecciones ejemplares que demuestran la extraordinaria vocaci n de los bolivianos para someter importantes decisiones pol ticas al pronunciamiento de la voluntad popular
3466005 at this point its water under the bridge theres no reason to dwell on it
3466006 im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3466007 its getting better unfortunately its a slower process than i would hope it would be but im making strides in the right direction
3466008 i believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales
3466009 in this society of course work is a torment naturally we hate it this does not mean that we are naturally lazy it means that we resent being treated like machines compelled to do mostly meaningless work for someone elses benefit
3466010 i believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales
3466011 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3466012 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3466013 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3466014 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3466015 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3466016 they begin to get the earliest forms of disability about 16 years later than do the controls
3466017 they have the same or fewer knee replacements or destroyed knees they have less musculoskeletal pain they spend less money on medical care expenses and by any metric that you use they have benefited from their lifelong exercise habit
3466018 what other kind of revolution could possible change the world perhaps whats crazy is what were doing and pursuing instead thinking after all these millennia that hate can conquer hate war cure war pride overcome pride violence end violence revenge stop revenge and exclusion create cohesion perhaps were the crazy ones
3466019 probably the lakes are a little clearer yes are they healthier im not sure
3466020 on a warm day there could be a hundred boats parked along this sandbar
3466021 the number of days with a pea green layer on the surface thats gone that doesnt happen ever we used to call them dog days
3466022 by the 1940s there was definite concern because of the poor quality of water
3466023 i can remember vividly my relative selling their property on lake sallie and moving to another lake so we know something was going on but we only have good comparable data going back into the 70s
3466024 probably the lakes are a little clearer yes are they healthier im not sure
3466025 i did a survey of this beach not too long ago and there are 49 properties and 62 boats
3466026 the notion that somehow a motor like this could have adverse impacts ten feet below the surface completely escapes the general public and for that matter the decision makers
3466027 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells
3466028 theres been a lot of talk that some of that traditional advertising has migrated to the digital world and weve seen the growth in our own numbers
3466029 as arbitron improves the sampling i think ppm will become widely accepted much like the diary methodology in the 1970s
3466030 the test scores show that in the diary methodology only six radio stations had a cume of 1 million people or more with ppm 21 stations had a cume of 1 million or more
3466031 so that goes to show you how much radio is used its used on a greater scale than what people believe
3466032 we had been having ongoing discussions on this for several months
3466033 theyre doing really well theres been significant growth in that group of stations and there will be more
3466034 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3466035 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3466036 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3466037 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3466038 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one

3466053 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
3466054 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
3466055 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
3466056 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
3466057 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system

3466061 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3466062 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3466063 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3466064 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3466065 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3466066 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3466067 i was totally clear not too many nerves excited but pretty calm it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3466068 we knew we were going to put up a fast time we just didnt want to screw it up
3466069 we were about as safe as you can get i basically waited until they touched the wall before i even started my windup
3466070 the fact he even went through that at trials and still came out on top way he did says so much about who he is and what he is
3466071 you hype it up so much in your head and then you get out there and youre like wow this is just another meet im here to do the same thing
3466072 but at the same time that was still a dream come true for me just to be able to race in the games
3466073 the first one is always the worst one to get under your belt im just glad that one is over with
3466074 im right where i need to be it was tough race but i know theres a little bit more in there
3466075 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3466076 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3466077 i just wanted to get to the semifinals and not make the same mistakes as athens so i went out hard
3466078 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3466079 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3466080 im fourth knowing that at the end i slowed down a bit so everythings cool
3466081 it was hard after losing the race yesterday but afterwards i realized i am happy with the silver medal
3466082 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3466083 now we need to move on and swim fast i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing

3466086 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys
3466087 probably be two to three years to get some oil
3466088 you know you can find oil pretty quickly you can put the engineering plans together if youve got infrastructure in place and thats why the oil industry continues to have interest in anwr cause the infrastructures there the trans atlantic pipeline is there it can bring oil quickly to the united states if anwr was opened up and you dont have to build new infrastructure
3466089 anwr would probably be two to three years to get some oil
3466090 3 to 4 years to construct the feeder pipelines to fabricate oil separation and treatment plants and transport them up from the lower 48 states to the north slope by ocean barge construct drilling pads drill to depth and complete the wells
3466091 assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the anwr area in 10 years
3466092 the primary constraints to a rapid development of anwr oil resources are the limited weather windows for collecting seismic data and drilling wells a 3 to 4 month winter window and for ocean barging of heavy infrastructure equipment to the well site a 2 to 3 month summer window

3466106 it is this estimates of u s military capabilities have turned out to be wildly overstated the bush administrations misplaced confidence in the efficacy of american arms represents a strategic misjudgment that has cost the country dearly even in an age of stealth precision weapons and instant communications armed force is not a panacea even in a supposedly unipolar era american military power turns out to be quite limited
3466107 how did it happen that americans so utterly overappraised the utility of military power
3466108 the military and american society had successfully patched up the differences that produced something akin to divorce during the divisive vietnam years
3466109 between what president bush called upon americas soldiers to do and what they were capable of doing loomed a huge gap that defines the military crisis besetting the united states today for a nation accustomed to seeing military power as its trump card the implications of that gap are monumental

3466122 from the first time that we had even talked to him he was very low key
3466123 when we interviewed him he did not act like hey im this big basketball star

3466155 personally i think its a top four decision and im prepared to say that quite often the tough decisions go the way of the teams in the top four and you dont get the rub of the green and it was wrong and they also should have had a player sent off as well when we had a fast break
3466156 nine points is still in front of us you need six points out of the next two games and go into the argie game with nothing to lose

3466171 rummages story is completely unbelievable when you consider that rummage was on the so called hit list bandied about during the recent merit hiring investigation and was supposedly targeted by mr nighbert because of his political affiliation
3466172 contrary to the position asserted in the merit hiring investigation that rummage was targeted by nighbert it is now asserted by rummage that he and nighbert were actually friendly enough to conspire together
3466173 over the past year mr rummage and the office of project delivery have been a key component to the department of highways success in reaching a record level of newly contracted work
3466174 through the efforts of mr rummage and his team the transportation cabinet is well on the way to surpassing our record level of newly contracted work in 2007

3466200 the blood group of the sample taken from the patient did not match the group in the records from previous admissions this was identified before any incorrect group blood was given
3466201 the result was a delay in transfusion and the patients life was placed at a significant and unnecessary risk

3466232 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3466233 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3466234 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3466235 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3466236 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3466237 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around

3466242 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3466243 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3466244 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment

3466265 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3466266 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3466267 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3466268 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3466269 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3466270 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3466271 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3466272 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3466273 hasta ahora lo que yo he podido leer de las mismas no he visto ninguna norma que colida con la constituci n creo que esas afirmaciones son un poco ligeras en todo caso tendr a que terminar de leerlas para ver eso podr a comentar que la ley de seguridad social es una ley de vanguardia una ley que engloba todo lo que es la seguridad social y el aspecto laboral y la salud me parece que es una ley que va a tono con la sociedad
3466274 no se puede siempre complacer a todo el mundo el tiempo necesario que se toma cada organismo para decidir en cuanto a cualquier hecho sometido a su competencia se toma el tiempo necesario pero yo veo que hay cuestionamientos que no tienen fundamento como por ejemplo decir que una ley sali muy r pido o muy lento

3466288 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3466289 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3466290 el anuncio de las leyes habilitantes por parte del presidente se ha tratado de usar o convertir en un hecho electoral
3466291 yo de verdad quiero hacerle un llamado a todos los elementos que tienen parte de la opini n p blica a nivel nacional que hagan un esfuerzo por no politizar un elemento tan importante como es la promulgaci n de las leyes hechas por el presidente ch vez
3466292 esperemos el momento para hacer las observaciones creo que si hay algunas observaciones perfectamente pueden ir al tribunal supremo de justicia tsj que es la instancia desde el punto de vista jur dico para no contaminar esas observaciones desde el punto de vista electoral que en vez de ayudar a profundizar algunas cosas que podemos hacer lo que hacen es entorpecer porque no permiten claridad
3466293 no contaminemos este momento que es importante para la patria y que es importante para el pa s

3466296 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3466297 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3466298 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives

3466304 den namen kevin fand ich schon immer toll darunter stelle ich mir jemanden vor der frech und sexy ist ein bi chen so wie mein cousin allerdings ist der noch zu jung
3466305 ich finde den namen till sehr sexy dabei denke ich an einen ganz attraktiven mann der witzig und sympathisch ist au erdem repr sentiert er st rke und bietet mir eine schulter zum anlehnen
3466306 mir gefallen generell m nnernamen die mit l beginnen gut besonders gern mag ich den namen leon damit verbinde ich einen sensiblen einf hlsamen mann der aber auch ein bisschen geheimnisvoll ist
3466307 ich kenne zwei m nner mit dem namen yves beide haben einen dunkleren teint und sind sehr attraktiv deshalb ist dieser name f r mich sexy
3466308 als ich 14 jahre alt war bin ich in eine isabelle verliebt gewesen leider ist nie etwas aus uns geworden aber den namen verbinde ich bis heute mit attraktivit t
3466309 der name alicia bezeichnet f r mich eine frau mit einem nat rlichen wesen dazu ist sie noch attraktiv und sympathisch das alles macht sie f r mich sexy all das trifft auch auf die schauspielerin alicia silverstone zu daher meine vorliebe f r den namen
3466310 gar kein taschengeld zu geben ist schlimm zu viel aber auch wenn ein kind zu wenig bekommt f hlt es sich eventuell nicht wertgesch tzt oder es beginnt zu klauen wenn es zu viel bekommt wird es verw hnt und lernt nicht mit geld gut umzugehen
3466311 kinder bis etwa zum 9 lebensjahr sollten w chentlich geld bekommen
3466312 vom 10 lebensjahr k nnen sie aber auch schon einen l ngeren zeitraum berbr cken sodass wir empfehlen bis zum 4 lebensjahr sollte kein taschengeld gegeben werden mit f nf jahren kann es ein euro pro woche sein mit 6 8 jahren zwei euro pro woche mit neun jahren 2 50 euro pro woche mit zehn jahren 12 50 euro pro monat mit elf und 12 jahren 15 euro pro monat mit 13 jahren 20 euro pro monat mit 14 jahren 25 euro pro monat mit 15 jahren 30 euro pro monat und mit 16 jahren 40 euro pro monat
3466313 is also still as great as ever with a factor of 2 at both high and low latitudes
3466314 because we have not had recent climate changes of the magnitude forecast for the rest of this century
3466315 we can have greater confidence in the multi model mean changes than in that of any individual model for climate change assessments
3466316 it is doubtful that averaging different formulations together will end up giving the right result
3466317 model responses e g tropical land precipitation can often be of different signs and there can be little confidence that averaging them together will produce a better result
3466318 at this point we cannot determine the low and high latitude sensitivities and we have no real way of obtaining them our italics
3466319 affect the confidence we can have in many of our projections of atmospheric dynamic and hydrologic responses to global warming
3466320 forecasting even the large scale response to climate change is not easy given the current uncertainties
3466321 regional responses may be the end result of varying influences in part due to warming in different tropical and high latitude regions
3466322 real progress will be the result of continued and newer observations along with modeling improvements based on these observations
3466323 there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us
3466324 der zeitraum von 100 tagen ist f r eine erste inhaltliche bestandsaufnahme zu knapp bemessen inhaltlich soll die arbeit von polizei und feuerwehr aber weiterhin auf erfolgskurs bleiben

3466327 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3466328 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3466329 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3466330 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3466331 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3466332 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3466333 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3466334 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3466335 im moment sind wir noch damit besch ftigt die infrastruktur aufzubauen
3466336 es wird ein offenes camp und wir hoffen dass auch hamburger zu uns kommen
3466337 es wird ein offenes camp bei uns ist jeder willkommen

3466345 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3466346 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3466347 si jes s neira no hubiera intervenido no hubiera ocurrido nada
3466348 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3466349 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3466350 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3466351 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3466352 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3466353 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3466354 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3466355 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3466356 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3466357 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3466360 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
3466361 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3466362 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3466363 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3466364 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3466365 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3466366 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3466367 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3466368 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3466369 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3466370 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3466371 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love

3466373 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3466374 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3466375 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3466455 we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3466456 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3466457 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict
3466458 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and well continue our discussions with all of the parties involved

3466475 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3466476 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3466477 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3466478 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3466479 it is great to get the younger players from the academy to train with us and to expose them to the level that the seniors play at
3466480 we will try to blood them against bath and expose them to a quality side to see how they get on
3466481 they need to know how big a jump it is to the professional standard
3466482 they are three good young players and the academy players really are the future of the club
3466483 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3466484 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3466485 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3466486 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3466487 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3466488 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3466489 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3466490 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3466491 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3466492 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3466493 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3466494 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3466495 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3466496 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3466497 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3466498 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3466499 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3466500 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3466501 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby

3466508 youre wrong youve kept an innocent man in jail all this time
3466509 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3466510 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3466511 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3466512 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3466513 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3466514 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3466515 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3466516 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3466517 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3466518 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3466519 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3466520 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3466521 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3466522 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3466523 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3466524 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3466525 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3466526 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3466527 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3466528 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3466529 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3466530 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3466531 california republicans aligned for tomorrow s mission is to identify develop and support strong republican candidates who can win key statewide general elections in california
3466532 the state is in an even bigger budget mess than it was in under gov gray davis budgets are growing faster the deficits are bigger the unfunded liabilities and debt ratios are more ominous
3466533 the answer is to start challenging the democrats on core issues by outlining an alternative set of values and principles its time to directly explain even in san francisco why limited government and personal freedom should be the prime goals of public policy
3466534 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3466535 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3466536 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3466537 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3466538 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3466539 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3466540 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3466541 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3466542 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3466543 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3466544 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3466545 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3466546 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3466547 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3466548 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3466549 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3466550 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3466551 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3466552 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3466553 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3466554 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3466555 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3466556 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3466557 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3466558 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3466559 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3466560 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3466561 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3466562 t he dramatic military attack by the military of the republic of georgia on south ossetia in the last days has brought the world one major step closer to the ultimate horror of the cold war era
3466563 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

3466566 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
3466567 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3466568 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3466569 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3466570 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3466571 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3466572 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3466573 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3466574 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3466575 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3466576 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

3466585 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3466586 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3466587 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3466588 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3466589 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3466590 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3466591 aber wir wollten in dieser saison echte highlights bieten die kosten viel

3466593 98 of top quartile performing large cap money managers spent at least one three year period in the bottom half of the crowd 75 spent at least one three year period in the bottom quarter and 43
3466594 spent at least one three year period in the bottom decile
3466595 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3466596 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3466597 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3466598 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3466599 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice

3466660 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3466679 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3466680 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem

3466682 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3466683 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector

3466685 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general

3466691 o retrospecto do ilan no futebol franc s muito bom e para isso basta analisar a passagem dele pelo sochaux e pelo saint ettienne
3466692 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3466693 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

3466697 professor myers there is a palpable level of hatred towards religion on your blog
3466698 the face of the new atheism irrational dogmatic and hate filled
3466699 sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments and other liturgical actions as well as persons things or places consecrated to god sacrilege is a grave sin especially when committed against the eucharist for in this sacrament the true body of christ is made substantially present for us
3466700 reprehensible inexcusable and unconstitutional his flagrant display of irreverence by profaning a consecrated host from a catholic church goes beyond the limit of academic freedom and free speech
3466701 i was brought up as a casual lutheran and left the church when i was 14
3466702 i was not fervent in my beliefs it was one of those things where you go to church every week

3466706 pz myers would have you believe that faith is a crutch something that makes you feel better but in the long run holds you back
3466707 this is an old saw faith and not the trappings of faith religiosity is no crutch it is a lifelong process that holds us accountable to a person a personal god and not some abstract philosophy
3466708 pz knew that we were making a film about evolution and religion he even signed the release that gave the filmmakers the right to use the footage as they saw fit
3466709 out there to stir up outrage and make money for himself he is there to play the martyr and feed the persecution complex
3466710 part egotist part bigot his behavior is clearly designed to insult hurt and intimidate catholics
3466711 we want to know what the university of minnesota morris is going to do about professor myers

3466715 you have insulted and hurt thousands of catholics what do you have to say for that
3466716 the whole silly part of this whole episode is that ive got so many people writing me and saying that i have seriously hurt them but what have i done i have thrown away a cracker
3466717 like a little girl trying to hurt another little girl by pulling the head off her doll

3466730 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3466731 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3466732 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3466733 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3466734 in the heat of the moment everybody can get carried away
3466735 but its important that we respect referees and opponents and its important for us as professionals to give a good example
3466736 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
3466737 its up to the players to show more respect to referees
3466738 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
3466739 its down to us as a group of players and referees to get a consistent base
3466740 its going to be a continuing relationship with referees we are looking to move it forward and i think we can its down to me to take responsibility for my team mates before they get that booking
3466741 i think the idea is terrific its designed to cut out excesses and thats what we are trying to do
3466742 everybody is signed up to make it work and it will be great if it does

3466747 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3466748 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3466749 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3466750 and they are dancing the board floor slamming under the jackboots and the fiddlers grinning hideously over their canted pieces towering over them all is the judge and he is naked dancing his small feet lively and quick and now in doubletime and bowing to the ladies huge and pale and hairless like an enormous infant he never sleeps he says he says hell never die he bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite the judge he wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass two passes dancing and fiddling all at once his feet are light and nimble he never sleeps he says that he will never die he dances in light and in shadow and he is a great favorite he never sleeps the judge he is dancing dancing he says that he will never die
3466751 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3466752 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3466753 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3466754 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3466755 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3466756 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3466757 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3466758 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3466759 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3466760 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3466761 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3466762 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3466763 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3466764 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3466765 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3466766 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3466767 oh god oh dylan it must be cold down there it is cold enough on top in november the dirtiest month of the year that killed you on the ninth vile day if only i could take you a bowl of your bread and milk and salt that you always drank at night to warm you up i am not going into that waste allotment of a ts eliot elegy of a cemetery dylan will have to move up in his single ditch snug under the cliff and make room for me then we can keep each other warm or cold or maggot breeding
3466768 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3466769 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3466770 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3466771 die verhandlungen ber fl chentausch und ausgleichszahlungen mit der stadt laufen

3466773 really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3466774 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3466775 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3466776 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3466777 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3466778 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3466779 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3466780 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3466781 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3466782 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3466783 the bear whos usually first in line for bamboo brunch suddenly lost interest in her morning munchies
3466784 i was scared it was pitch black i didnt know the area i was not necessarily prepared to hit him
3466785 i had a duty of care to him he was vulnerable
3466786 this larger stronger institution will do a better job recruiting top talent marketing our financial solutions and serving the community
3466787 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
3466788 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3466789 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3466790 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3466791 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3466792 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3466793 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3466794 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3466795 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3466796 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3466797 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3466798 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3466799 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3466800 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3466801 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3466802 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3466803 does a governorship have more credibility than congressman or senator
3466804 the average age of elected presidents since 1952 the era of televised politics is 56
3466805 mccain is scare mongering and creating fear in americans just as weve seen republicans do in the last 8 years fear seems to work which is why they are doing it again get scared of the black guy etc etc very old politics of mcbush mcsame
3466806 what i think it boils down to is are the democrats just as motivated for obama in 08 as they were with an
3466807 please tell me a mccain policy that is not in line with bush
3466808 we hadnt realised quite how much the show means to people

3466843 no estamos en condiciones de aprobar porque no se atacan los problemas estructurales del transantiago y se comete una tremenda injusticia con lo que se refiere al subsidio para el transporte en regiones esperamos que el gobierno se pueda abrir a una forma distinta de financiamiento para transantiago y para el subsidio a regiones
3466844 voy a insistir con el gobierno hoy dicen que s lo hasta puerto montt pueden subsidiar las micros porque en chilo no hay micros les digo que entonces subsidiemos el trasbordo en el canal de chacao y ellos dicen que eso es imposible entonces mi voto es en contra

3466846 de aqu a ma ana hay conversaciones con todos los parlamentarios de la concertaci n de todos los partidos e incluso se ha hablado de un protocolo de acuerdo sobre temas que pudieran verse hacia delante
3466847 hay que tener claridad que esa soluci n administrativa que es una de varias alternativas permitir a asegurar la continuidad del sistema en la ciudad de santiago mantener la tarifa fija el resto del a o pero no permite recoger los beneficios que el proyecto contempla para el resto de las regiones
3466848 no veo por qu tenga que cambiar mi posici n no ha andado esta cosa est igual o peor y en consecuencia voy a mantener mi posici n
3466849 decir que el sistema est peor que cuando comenz es simplemente un hecho falso evidente para toda persona que utilice el transporte p blico en santiago

3466851 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3466852 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3466853 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3466865 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3466866 and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
3466867 this disastrous proposal makes about as much sense as eliminating homeland security at airports
3466868 sure it would make air travel more convenient but it would put passengers at greater risk just as this proposal would put wildlife at greater risk
3466869 the very agencies that have often resisted efforts to adjust their projects to accommodate the needs of rare wildlife would now be put in charge of deciding whether any adjustment is needed
3466870 although the bush administration claims its proposal would make only narrow changes to existing regulations these unprecedented changes would have broad consequences imperiling hundreds of endangered species nationwide

3466872 one of the greatest challenges we face as a fire service is to stop the needless deaths of firefighters while in service to their communities
3466873 every day across this nation firefighters are responding to emergencies that threaten the lives of their residents these same threats also threaten the lives of firefighters unfortunately we all lost far too many firefighters in 2007

3466884 he started thinking more and more about the off time the family a lot of people dont know but he was very involved with charitable organizations skip is a private man a charitable man and yet he can tell a joke like anybody
3466885 i think most people underestimated his intelligence because a lot of his humor went right over their heads but he had a good time with it it was his spirit and that kind of humor has to be coming from somone who is very very intelligent
3466886 first thing was have you heard this one because he enjoyed telling a joke enjoyed hearing a good joke and was just so much more than a broadcaster
3466887 there was just no way that i would have continued playing forever
3466888 so with all the experience and knowledge i gained from my extensive playing career the next logical step for me to take was coaching i am starting a new career that is why i am empowering myself with coaching qualifications so that i add on to what i learnt from my playing days
3466889 in modern trends of the game you really need to equip yourself
3466890 i want to be involved in coaching and so i believe the coaching course i have done in the uk is a good starting off point from now on i want to be climbing the coaching ladder and i am glad that i have already been given the platform to start off by assisting doctor

3466917 the mets had no interest in adam dunn who was traded monday from cincinnati to arizona the mets internally had the same feeling about dunn that many organizations have that he has some overt skills namely power and the ability to draw a walk but that he is a poor defender strikes out a ton and they wonder about his passion to play and drive to be a championship player
3466918 take advantage of your opportunity throw the ball over the middle and let your pitch work
3466919 strikes out too much not clutch bad in field blah blah blah
3466920 he has some overt skills namely power and the ability to draw a walk
3466921 one of the free state stars players fell on my knee when we fell after contesting for a high ball i tried to ignore the pain but it became worse and i decided to ask the technical team to replace me

3466926 acredito que posso me encaixar perfeitamente na folha salarial do vasco pois qualquer jogador sonha em atuar por essa equipe
3466927 quando uma equipe n o vai bem e os resultados n o est o aparecendo normal que isso aconte a
3466928 esse jogo do vit ria foi uma partida at pica e n o serve de an lise do time quem acompanha os jogos do vasco principalmente em casa sabe que o time pode render muito mais

3466939 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3466940 so he is really the man for the job at this critical time in world history
3466941 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3466942 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3466943 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop from shipping our jobs overseas
3466944 john mccain should be ashamed of himself not just for voting against protecting an american company like but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in sturgis and pretending to be one of them
3466945 i believe they are the heartland of america and the judeo christian values they hold are the strength of america

3466947 ik was wel even verrast toen nikkie mij vorige week belde op mijn vakantieadres ik had niet verwacht dat zij nu al zou gaan

3466950 je presentator moet aansprekend zijn voor de doelgroep jonge mensen identificeren zich nu eenmaal sneller met iemand die ook nog jong is
3466951 ja dat ben ik wel met je eens we cre ren personalitys al doen ze dat voor het grootste deel zelf de vj moet echt wel zelf wat in huis hebben wij faciliteren ze met een format het is vervolgens aan de vj daar op de juiste wijze invulling aan te geven het is namelijk niet zo dat een vj even binnen komt lopen en gaat presenteren de vj vergadert mee en komt zelf ook met idee n voor de programmas
3466952 een jaar geleden hadden we maar twee vjs nu houden we sascha visser en saar koningsberger nog over dus de programmering loopt geen gevaar daarnaast is soumia abalhaja red freelance vj en neemt zij verschillende items voor ons op en presenteert ze tmf pure tenslotte is willy van de opposites net begonnen met het programma wakker worden op vakantie wie weet wat daar uit voortkomt de voortekenen zijn in ieder geval goed
3466953 hoe we dat talent vergaren we krijgen permanent mailtjes van mensen die schrijven ik wil op tv geregeld nodigen we iemand uit voor een screentest maar nu twee toonaangevende gezichten vertrekken willen we eigenlijk ook groots uitpakken met hun opvolgers

3466964 i have decided not to renew a number of contracts so that players can go and look for new teams i am very proud of the fact that psl clubs have signed 80 percent of the players that have left cosmos
3466965 i know it wont be easy against etoile du sahel but i am very sure kotoko wont disappoint
3466966 i am disappointed but not discouraged by the new injury because all three doctors that i have consulted have said that it is not too severe so there is really no need to worry like i did the last time
3466967 the good thing is that it is not the same leg as the last time i will be out for 3 4 months but the doctors have told me that i can start jogging in seven weeks
3466968 i am glad that this injury doesnt call for an operation like i had initially thought
3466969 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
3466970 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
3466971 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
3466972 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
3466973 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines
3466974 o clima mudou totalmente com o ney franco e hoje o nosso ambiente de trabalho completamente diferente com os jogadores conseguindo dar o melhor em campo pois ele consegue tirar o m ximo da gente

3466976 obviamente estou muito contente com o que est acontecendo pois aos poucos a equipe vai voltando ao normal jogando bem e tendo o apoio dos torcedores teremos um segundo turno todo pela frente e espero que a gente possa melhorar ainda mais o ney franco soube passar tranq ilidade a esse grupo e recuperar atletas que tinham ca do de produ o
3466977 foi um conjunto de fatores que fez a equipe crescer se n o tiv ssemos jogadores de qualidade o time n o iria bem al m disso temos uma comiss o t cnica muito competente o grupo vem se recuperando fisicamente de um jogo para outro meus auxiliares tamb m s o respons veis pelos treinamentos fora isso a diretoria d uma boa estrutura de trabalho

3466999 we think we need to look at how we are working with russia
3467000 we are working with different bodies in nato we are working with the military committee to discuss all possible measures including military assistance
3467001 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato
3467002 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3467003 it was a big mistake made by allies we think russia got this message as a green light
3467004 it is very important that all parties go back to the status quo ante that is as it existed on august 6
3467005 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3467006 this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
3467007 this is not what we consider to be a customary neighborhood nuisance
3467008 this is mr deebs hobby hes still got bunches of ideas i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation there are regulations about how much youre supposed to have how its detained how its disposed of
3467009 firefighters found more than 1 500 vials jars cans bottles and boxes in the basement tuesday afternoon
3467010 mr deebs home lab likely violated the regulations of many state and local departments although officials have not yet announced any penalties
3467011 oh my god this man had 12 pounds of gunpowder in his garage and look at all this ammunition its an arsenal of destruction
3467012 allow me to translate ms wildermans words into plain english mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
3467013 wenn ich an die zeit von damals denke habe ich als erstes mein wohngebiet im fasanengarten in erinnerung es war ein ruhiger ort mit vielen wiesen und k hen eigentlich kenne ich das aus holland aber es passt nicht zu mir ich komme vom wasser bin ein beachboy
3467014 ich war jung die konkurrenz auf meiner position war mit kapellmann und niedermayer sehr gro ich wollte weg aber ich wei auch noch dass uli hoene versucht hat mich umzustimmen sp ter habe ich bereut dass ich nicht geblieben bin aber das ist oft so in der karriere
3467015 soweit ich wei hat der hsv in der allianz arena noch nie verloren ich hoffe dass es am stadion liegt
3467016 wichtig ist dass wir uns jetzt auf bayern konzentrieren und mit allen anderen sachen nicht besch ftigen wir haben leute die f r uns unterwegs sind aber so schnell geht das alles nicht wenn alle fit sind haben wir eine gute mannschaft dennoch werden wir weiter alles daf r tun einen starken kader zu bekommen

3467054 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3467055 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3467056 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3467057 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3467058 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3467059 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3467060 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3467061 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3467062 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3467063 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3467064 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3467065 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3467066 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3467067 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3467068 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3467069 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3467070 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3467071 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3467072 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3467073 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3467074 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3467075 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3467076 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3467077 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3467078 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3467079 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3467080 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3467081 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3467082 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3467083 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3467084 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3467085 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3467086 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3467087 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3467088 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3467089 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3467090 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3467091 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
3467092 niets gaat boven het gevoel dat ik krijg als ik the god of thunder ben
3467093 laat mensen waar ook ter wereld een foto van de band zien en ze zeggen dat is carol hendrix niet de muziek ongecompliceerde hardrock maar de geschminkte gezichten buitenissige kostuums en bombastische shows maken de band tot een fenomeen
3467094 het had totaal geen zin de bandleden bij een concertzaal op te wachten want als ze naar binnen gingen hadden ze hun make up al op
3467095 na afloop van de concerten stonden de limousines klaar de groep werd heel goed afgeschermd
3467096 de groep heeft al tien jaar niks nieuws meer uitgebracht dat staat me een beetje tegen ik denk dat heel veel fans een nieuwe plaat juichend tegemoet zullen zien
3467097 we moeten eerst uitzoeken hoe we onze muziek op een nieuwe manier kunnen verkopen
3467098 wat de mensen ook zeggen het uitwisselen van bestanden via internet is als vergif dat juist datgene doodt waarvan ze zoveel houden

3467275 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3467276 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict

3467287 notre dame has traditionally cherished its standing as an independent the changes that have taken place in college football over the past several years particularly with the bowl alliance have made life more difficult for independents
3467288 the addition of notre dame would most likely be advantageous for the big ten with 11 teams currently in the conference the big ten could add a 12th allowing it to split into two six team divisions and set up a conference championship game such a game could provide each school in the conference with as much as 2 million in additional revenue similar formats are already in place in several conferences including the southeastern conference and the big 12
3467289 the university of notre dame fighting irish worth 101 million is the most valuable team in college football
3467290 one problem with adding the fighting irish to one of the nations oldest athletic conferences is notre dames television contract with nbc the school recently signed a new deal with the network which will pay the fighting irish 9 million a year through 2005
3467291 its one of those things notre dame will have to look at and see what the landscape looks like and try to decide whats best for them
3467292 i think notre dame can do what it wants i dont think theres anybody around who would turn notre dame down if notre dame came and said wed like to be in your conference i think it has its own choices to make
3467293 if notre dame regains its football prominence under coach charlie weis who reportedly has a throwback recruiting class to soothe the pain of the 3 9 debacle last fall the irish will have no reason to question the viability of remaining independent if the losing continues to the point where a conference affiliation becomes the ultimate concession to contemporary reality the big ten and its natural midwest rivalries will be impossible to resist
3467294 notre dames football program contributed 21 1 million to the universitys academic programs last season far more than any other college football team
3467295 notre dame is just afraid to play in the big ten
3467296 yeah but even penn state joined the big ten after being independent for so many years and its worked for them
3467297 but thats because penn state is losing every year more so than notre dame and with being part of a conference franchise the profit sharing is the only thing keeping them afloat
3467298 18 of 22 athletics programs at the university of notre dame compiled graduation rates of 100 percent and none were below 90 percent according to the third year of graduation success rate measurements developed by the ncaa and released wednesday none of the 120 division i a football playing programs in the country had a higher percentage of 100 gsr scores than did notre dame with its 818 figure

3467361 georgians are a melodramatic people and few more so than their hyperactive president
3467362 is that appeasement we see sidling shyly out of the closet of history

3467422 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3467423 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3467424 stonehenge is perhaps englands most famous and important ancient monument inscribed with avebury as a world heritage site in 1986 the need to care for it properly has been recognised for many years as has the need to improve its landscape setting and its presentation to visitors publication of the world heritage site management plan in 2000 was an important step forward at its heart was a vision of stonehenge surrounded by open grassland two major projects were planned to support this to remove the roads from around stonehenge by placing the a303 in a tunnel and to relocate visitor facilities to a new centre away from the stones public inquiries were held into each and the outcomes reviewed at length although the government decided that the a303 road improvements were unaffordable it has made a commitment in december 2007 to review the management plan as the overarching strategic document for the site and to complete environmental improvements at stonehenge including new visitor facilities in time for the 2012 olympics this work includes examination of the case for closing the a303 a344 junction to improve the setting of stonehenge a new stonehenge project board chaired by the ministers for culture and for transport has been set up to oversee this work these proposals are now the subject of a three month public consultation until 17 october 2008

3467447 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3467448 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3467453 i thought that i knew something about blogging joining blogmastermind has shown me i did know something but little of it was useful blogmastermind is fantastic and i believe it will be worth every dollar many times over
3467454 the blog mastermind coaching course is a jewel yaro starak has managed to couple solid content with a simple and masterful teaching style in an information packed course thats moving me step by step in a strategic fashion toward my goals as a blogger the content alone wouldve made me happy the icing on the cake is that yaros sincere desire for students to succeed bleeds through in his presentations and business systems hes built a sustainable highly profitable business and most importantly is teaching me to do the same im elated with the program my success is assured
3467455 ive just recently signed up for yaros blog mastermind course and have already gotten a lot of value from it im a financial advisor and personal finance blogger in atlanta ga usa and i was interested in getting some help mentoring about how to be a more effective writer while building my audience a couple of immediate things ive gotten from the course is the need to have a multi pronged approach for marketing monetizing etc all too often i see bloggers who have google adsense plastered all over their blog but dont have any other monetization strategies working for them similarly i see many bloggers in the personal finance niche constantly commenting on each others blogs which in my opinion just creates a big echo chamber and ive been guilty of this myself while i dont plan to attempt to monetize my blog at this time i do want to build my audience and build a large email list at yaros suggestion ive begun using aweber for my email and continue to use feedburner for rss also im beginning to look outside the personal finance blogosphere for other interesting sites like yours where i can network and build relationships yes its very early in yaros course but ive already received tremendous value and am eager to get more and more info from yaro in the coming days and weeks
3467456 i was tempted to join blog mastermind the first time it was offered but i procrastinated while reading the blog profits blueprint i realized after reading it there was lots i could learn and i saw yaro was very truthful and helpful in his teachings he never claimed to know everything but was willing to share what he had learned he relied on others such as yourself to add value to this course im excited as i begin the lessons and i look forward to learning how to promote my blog and help others as i learn from blog mastermind
3467457 my first impressions are positive i already have a wordpress org blog up and running but my site is ripe for improvement and i get the impression that as the lessons roll onwards its going to be a steep learning curve the members only forum is filled with relevant faqs and helpful fellow members and i am already drawing upon this useful resource

3467540 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3467542 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3467543 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3467544 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3467545 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable
3467546 getting a paper into siggraph is an accomplishment for any senior researcher in computer graphics presenting a paper in siggraph based on work done as an undergraduate is astonishing were very proud of alex and his work
3467547 ive never given a talk in front of more than 30 or 40 people at siggraph the audience will be 300 or 400
3467548 but im excited these are exactly the people i want to show my work to

3467550 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions

3467552 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3467553 we worked on head mounted displays improved tiled displays rendering and streaming software colour calibration techniques collaboration and networking and novel interaction systems
3467554 better yet the handheld model can also block out daylight so you dont get the usual problem of sunlight washing out the image it is a breakthrough and the daylight blocking hmd will feature this month at siggraph 2008 in los angeles
3467555 it takes a lot of processing power to render a virtual image onto a real landscape mobile device cpus cannot really cope we developed a video streaming protocol that allows a desktop to perform the rendering but then streams a compressed signal across wireless networks
3467556 we are already in discussion with some companies about commercial opportunities for the rendering platform
3467557 in contrast to marker based tracking where we track labels with patterns on it in marker less tracking we detect feature points in real scenes and compare current images from a camera to calibrated reference images of the same scene to calculate the current position of a user
3467558 you get big calibration problems with projectors on multi tiled displays because projectors vary or projector bulbs deteriorate at different rates it affects image quality but our calibration tool ensures faithful colour across the multiple screens
3467559 the mix of applications meant we had to develop low cost but high performance systems the tests were successful and the system performed well
3467560 it is unlikely that the platform will be commercialised as one product but most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available
3467561 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3467562 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3467563 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3467564 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3467565 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will
3467566 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3467567 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3467568 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended
3467569 just having a green roof may not mean anything in terms of preventing water from reaching the street level for instance

3467579 it is almost a throwback to the violence witnessed in the early 1990s this is getting from bad to worse
3467580 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3467581 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation
3467582 nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3467583 the situation was slipping out of hand and the police had to open fire in which at least two people mohammad maqbool and abdul aziz were killed a few others were injured
3467584 senior government officers have already visited the state to see the existing infrastructure there however a decision in the matter can be taken only through mutual arrangements between india and pakistan any unilateral move in this direction will neither be practical nor wise
3467585 though prime minister manmohan singh doesnt have the capability to remove lalu prasad we still demand a thorough inquiry and resignation of the railways minister
3467586 at least he should be removed from the ministry till the inquiry is completed criminal cases should be registered immediately
3467587 the meeting will finalise a notification on this and the prime minister will later announce it during his address to the nation on independence day aug 15

3467596 state universities and colleges like up should be catering to the financially underprivileged during these difficult times but now that up has tuition that is comparable to private universities with p1 000 per unit as base bracket the countrys premiere state university has conclusively negated its orientation as a university for the underprivileged but deserving students

3467601 in fact the un special rapporteur philip alston has recommended the removal of ejk from the counter insurgency program
3467602 esperon has yet to cast off his militarist mindset of pacification and has yet to be made accountable for the extra judicial killings of a thousand activists
3467603 it appears that arroyo and the afp just went through the motion of prolonging negotiations and accommodating certain demands of the milf only to keep them from resuming its armed offensives but the regime does not seem to have made serious efforts to ensure that the evolving agreements are accepted by her allies the affected communities and the public

3467632 i never encountered him advocating for lifting the embargo or travel restrictions
3467633 we were looking for ways to promote the idea that during construction newmarket is still open for business the economy is certainly struggling and given people are detouring through town its potentially harmful to a lot of the small businesses the big take home message is to encourage people to shop in newmarket
3467634 summers are usually a lot busier because of ice cream sales but it is nice to see actual progress with construction like sidewalks and curbs instead of a large hole
3467635 besides the economy people remember the traffic patterns from last year and i think people have the concept they cant come down here when they can the construction workers are really trying their best
3467636 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3467637 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3467638 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3467639 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3467640 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3467641 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3467642 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3467643 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3467644 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
3467645 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
3467646 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
3467647 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer
3467648 we have a lot more people coming to our beach and parking than they have which accounts for the increased income
3467649 expenses associated with one year arent necessarily the same as the next
3467650 for example we dont pave the lots every year and the costs cant be limited to just the beach area

3467710 i knew park was going to finish well so i had to finish a whole body length ahead
3467711 its definitely an honor i have met and spent time with carl lewis and exchanged words with spitz so it is pretty amazing
3467712 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake it was a very fast time
3467713 when i saw the number 1 by my name i thought they had made a mistake then i saw my name there and i realized that id got it
3467714 i looked up and saw matt next to me and i was elated
3467715 i just had it come true and i think theres a lot more to come
3467716 we read a lot of stuff people say about us and it gets us fired up so many articles said the u s team was not going to make it to team finals or if they do there would be no chance of a medal
3467717 anything that got thrown at this team we rolled with it we never counted us out we never doubted ourselves i guess that were all first time olympians we never counted ourselves out
3467718 its really cool i just let myself go off and performed as myself thats good enough
3467719 we also understand that this is pool play but at the same time this team right here weve lost one game in three years and greece is that only team to do that so far we definitely feel like we owe them
3467720 maybe our defense is not good enough or maybe our cooperation is not good enough
3467721 i knew i needed most of the shots to break the record so they came one by one
3467722 there was so much going on in the crowd i just stood there at the end i thought i was up
3467723 i feel like i should have been up every round and every round was tied
3467724 i felt like the scoring wasnt right because i worked so hard for this and to come this far and lose in the first round it isnt right it doesnt seem real to me
3467725 we knew we could have dived better but were really happy with how we finished
3467726 for our 3 1 2 somersault i ducked my head a little bit on entry
3467727 before i went to tsinghua university my coach said my given name ruoxue means like snow in chinese appeared to be a little weak according to its chinese meaning
3467728 ive read a book saying that a name is just a symbol and we have to make our own efforts to achieve whatever we want
3467729 i didnt feel any pressure i was lagging behind in the first round
3467730 my coach told me to be more aggressive and more active in attacking so i did and the rest of the bout went smoothly
3467731 we like to think we have a balance in our forward line that we dont focus too hard on one player but by definition we have better players in our group and our captain is one of those
3467732 we got the job done and are looking forward to the semifinal
3467733 it is fantastic for me to be the olympic champion again after 12 years my dream has come true

3467742 it is very complicated and difficult so i am even more happy with the my result
3467743 one of our most resourceful and indomitable committee chairs david bialik also holds the distinction of coordinating broadcast events for both our west and east coast conventions
3467744 his sense of commitment and dedication are matched only by his ability to produce outstanding and extremely well attended programs
3467745 this convention revisits issues which continue to impact heavily on the broadcast sector even as they evolve through an on going chain of permutations
3467746 loudness the transition to digital broadcasting internet streaming and growing concerns over listener fatigue promise to spark lively and informative discussions
3467747 david bialik has once again developed an outstanding series of broadcast events

3467764 it was in davids interest to argue that it did not know of the falsity of the alleged statements if david succeeded its liability for defamation and any resulting damage award would be covered under the insurance policy by contrast utica had no interest in trying to show davids lack of knowledge were the fact finder to hold david liable for intentional defamation utica would escape liability for any compensatory damage award
3467765 royals letter reserving its right was inadequate because in using the words may and possibly it did not advise the insured unequivocally and clearly of its intention to reserve a particular defense
3467766 we note that the policy contained an exclusion for libel or slander made by the insured with knowledge of the falsity thereof foremost in its april 26 letter did not reserve the future right to deny coverage under this exclusion and thereby waived its right to assert the exclusion as a defense to coverage if foremost had reserved its rights under this exclusion a conflict would have been presented
3467767 when a condition would impose an absurd or impossible result the agreement will be interpreted as creating a covenant rather than a condition

3467833 we always have known and we must make sure that we do qualify for the next stage

3467838 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with
3467839 i actually think that patients think that the risk is a lot higher than it is so i hope that this paper somewhat reassures them that their risk of recurrence after they are five year survivors is probably not as high as they think it is

3467898 my eyes are amazed when friends take me to the a dong supermarket in west hartford and i see all the food

3467903 about 95 percent of our caseload right now is the karen refugees and i find them to be a very endearing people
3467904 they are extremely respectful hardworking and determined to learn our culture so they can succeed here just watch these folks they are really going somewhere in connecticut
3467905 the karen people were always village farming people but for me there was no village life
3467906 i grew up in the camps there is a whole generation of us who know nothing of outside life except a dream to come to a place like america in the camps i had no rights here i have rights but my mother is afraid to come to america because she knows nothing but life in the camps
3467907 all you could do in the camp is play volleyball go to school or learn english
3467908 there were no jobs i wanted an education to build my life

3467919 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3467920 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3467921 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3467922 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future

3468018 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3468019 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first

3468080 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3468081 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3468082 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3468083 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3468084 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3468085 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3468086 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3468087 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3468088 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3468107 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3468108 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3468109 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3468110 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3468111 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side

3468121 then the world caught fire and everyone started throwing gasoline on it and we made this 90 degree turn and invaded iraq

3468269 does not begin or end at the polling booth we are even told how to form our consciences beginning with a willingness and openness to seek the truth and what is right through the study of sacred scripture and the catechism of the catholic church and continuing with an examination of the background related to the choices before us we are told that forming our conscience also requires prayerful reflection to discern the will of god section 18
3468270 and yet nowhere in the article is the need to form ones conscience ever addressed instead readers are led to believe that they should vote on the basis of what they think or feel there is no reference to this active process catholics are instructed to perform the very essence of what it means to be a faithful citizen is omitted
3468271 is the compilation of general principles applied to the obligation that catholics have to exercise political responsibility in the light of their faith regardless of whether it is an election year and irrespective of the candidates who are running and the issues on which they are basing their campaigns
3468272 the times handling of the very delicate and complex challenge of voting also failed to represent the full scope of the bishops instructions the statement goes into great detail to emphasize that not all issues carry the same moral weight and that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions section 37 the document further cautions against the moral equivalence that makes no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life from the moment of conception until natural death is always wrong and is not just one issue among many it must always be opposed section 28
3468273 we call upon all church leaders in georgia to pray and work for the peace and to put pressure on the leather of both russia and georgia to cease hostilities
3468274 we believe a peaceful and stable georgia will benefit not only the nation of georgia itself but all people within that region
3468275 we pray that the conflict is peacefully resolved and opposing sides reconciled mutual forgiveness and acceptance must be exercised
3468276 we mourn the death of soldiers children men women and the elderly from both sides we deplore injustice aggression and the conflict resolution at the cost of civilian lives we call on the international community religious leaders and all people of goodwill for their support of the long suffering people of georgia
3468277 the war in georgia has left thousand of people without shelter food and medicine humanitarian disaster is inevitable unless something is done

3468279 what passengers wont tolerate is train companies using the flexibility allowed them by the system to put up some fares by nearly 11
3468280 nor will they tolerate unregulated fares going up by more than this at a time when high fuel prices mean that more people are travelling by train
3468281 it is a scandal that the rail companies have this trigger which allows them to put up fares every year
3468282 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3468283 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped

3468285 if youre depending on these web based applications you need a backup plan
3468286 systems are going to go down its a fact of life whats important is to be prepared when those systems go down which is a major reason that some kind of offline access should be built into systems like email in theory well reach a time when the cloud really is always on but were not close and it may never happen
3468287 but to date the effort has been mocked in cloud puritan quarters its not true cloud computing argue these cloud computing puritans microsoft is just trying to protect its software dominance duh they argue

3468301 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks

3468303 we see the ftc as absolutely critical but the states should be partners in this as well

3468355 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3468356 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3468357 i have a lot of friends that are just not going that have gone in years past

3468367 cant you see the situation here see how deserted it is there are no tourists and i am a boatman what am i supposed to do
3468368 though i cant give you figures off hand i can tell you this was a landmark year for kashmir tourism if we project the number of tourists we had till june for the rest of the year we would have gone past the figures for 1988 8 lakh people
3468369 if you are looking at tourism as an industry and are trying to see how it has affected the kashmiri then yours will be a wrong diagnosis whoever tells you kashmir is better off because of the tourism industry is trying to pull the wool over your eyes that is not the issue at all it is all political
3468370 the problem is political till the time one realises that nothing will change such periods of calm as the one we had will keep being shattered
3468371 the people of kashmir had their hopes raised when former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and pakistan president pervez musharraf came up with the confidence building measures here was an indian leader who seemed to understand the issues of the kashmiris and wanted to address them in all sincerity and there was a pakistani leader who came up with the unprecedented stand of saying that there cant be any redrawing of the borders but these borders can be made irrelevant there was real hope
3468372 the people here saw that as an injustice against them and the anti india feelings rose immediately added to it was the fact that the kashmiris thought that by slowing down the process india was using them as a leverage against a pakistan that was facing internal problems so there was this anger in the valley and the land issue was just the kind of issue that could easily spark these feelings
3468373 there is nothing that the upa government could have done to expedite the peace process that it hasnt done the dynamics of the vajpayee musharraf era were so good that the people thought this entire issue would be resolved in a year or so that was never the case but it is true that there is a slump in the peace process due to whatever reasons had hurt the people of kashmir
3468374 it exists from a long time ago when there were allegations that the elections were rigged in 1987 there was a huge hue and cry that it was delhis fault in a tamil nadu or a orissa it is the state politicians who face the flak for these things but in kashmir due to the long history of mistrust towards delhi the centre gets blamed for everything that happens there the inability of the centre to take up issues of the valley and the inability of the state leaders to handle the situation there has led to this environment
3468375 the congress had a tough time and all its focus was on the n deal and winning the trust vote they never paid heed to the situation in kashmir though it was deteriorating from june the bharatiya janata party for its part tried to make an electoral issue out of this
3468376 till the time the government took over the kashmiri muslim had a huge stake in the yatra the cave was discovered by a muslim there was an industry around the pilgrimage by which the muslims benefited and there were muslims on the administrative board when the state took over the muslims were booted out starting from here a chain reaction was set off which was perceived as a hindu agenda to take control of the entire process

3468442 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict

3468547 he has never failed to cast his vote in favor of whatever abortion restrictions are arguably permitted under roe v wade bans against partial birth abortion abortions on military bases transporting minors across state lines to obtain abortions behind their parents backs and government funding for abortion both in the united states and abroad in addition mccain has voted to confirm every strict constructionist judge appointed by the various republican presidents who have served during his tenure
3468548 he has voted to end the title x family planning program which pays for everything from birth control to breast cancer screenings and which is a target for the right because the recipients of these dollars also tend to be clinics that offer contraception to unwed and underage women and that offer abortions

3468571 uh i think youre just not understanding what hes saying a plan to get them into nato is not anything like wanting them to be in nato as they are now the way he phrases it it sounds like he knows its not workable to get them into nato yet but hes savvy enough to emphasize that he wants them in there
3468572 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato
3468573 um why exactly should we worry about the ukraine it has about ten times the population ten times the land area a far richer economy even per capita and a geography that makes the tactical situation somewhat different

3468575 we need a clear plan for georgia to join nato

3468668 the ministry with the support of the un food and agriculture organization fao has managed to obtain 2 6 million vaccines yet we require 15 million to vaccinate the entire sheep and goat population in the affected areas
3468669 we require technical personnel to be involved in the exercise that is expected to cover the entire northern kanya region it is expansive and expensive

3468674 we had an order for more than a half a million goats and sheep to be exported to the arab world before the end of the year but we cannot make it because of the poor health standards
3468675 i almost cried when i saw the goats dying in less than two days the only veterinary officer at the division was away and when he came back he told me that the goats died as a result of the disease

3468703 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3468704 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk

3468764 no it is never true there is no way a musician can bribe a dj they rather stipulate an amount for us to pay
3468765 any dj who makes that statement is an irresponsible one tell them that i samini said any dj who will make such a statement is irresponsible it may be that the dj himself enjoys the payola very well and that is why he made such a statement
3468766 even when you put it right in front of them
3468767 but for some of them not only will they take money but they will stipulate an amount they want and if you fail to offer it then it means your music wont go on air
3468768 i remember some few years back when i came out with a song entitled linda a dj in one of the radio stations in accra rejected my cd just because i couldnt raise the amount he wanted me to pay so i had to carry it elsewhere

3468812 we are getting into a warmer pattern following the heavy rain we got over the weekend the weather is going to stay on the hotter warmer side for the next couple of weeks which is about as far ahead as we can reasonably predict
3468813 when you look back at the weather from 2003 as a whole starting from january it looks very similar to what the whole weather for 2008 looks like however when you just look at the summer weather then you see differences in summer of 2003 between june and august the kelowna area received 23 6 millimeters of rain since june of this year kelowna has received 51 millimeters almost double the amount

3468816 one of the fellows in the other boat said he ducked and felt my boat go right over his head were all very lucky to be alive
3468817 judging by what the other driver told me he was running at a fairly high rate of speed and as far as im concerned there were no working lights on that boat
3468818 it doesnt matter how safe you think you are when its that dark at night and other boaters dont have running lights and going at an excess speed its impossible to see them until they are driving over you its really not a good idea to be boating at night on this lake even though you might be doing everything right theres always that other person you have to worry about

3468906 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
3468907 nothing is ever going to get as tough as you could put an asterisk next to it
3468908 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
3468909 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
3468910 we are not used to seeing this kind of major at a
3468911 but its still a major so youve got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully youll be there on sunday

3468948 we were biting our nails all the way up to the finish seeing what would happen
3468949 were starting a collection of pop culture and americana items
3468950 its his car even though he had it for four years and i had it for 38
3468951 it was hard but it was the right thing to do
3468952 i havent really cried yet but when he drives it away i think ill fall apart
3468953 the mother insists she did not tell the kid to steal the money
3468954 these additional voters guarantee virginia will be closer than its been before but closing that entire gap in one election is tough to do
3468955 i think theres no doubt that youth are going to turn out at rates higher than in previous elections
3468956 the question is is that turnout going to be so high that it alone affects the outcome of the election im not willing to say that youth will turn out in such a way that they will shape the election
3468957 nobody can bank on the youth vote because the youth vote hasnt been reliable in the past
3468958 i think his candidacy is getting a whole lot of young people to vote but theyre not going to vote for him
3468959 so this age group gives us our greatest pool for new voters
3468960 also this age group is very mobile moving to a new state for a new job thus i am not surprised that they are the lions share of the new voters
3468961 i think it is very close but it will be a massive upset if obama does carry virginia given our history
3468962 the kids learned about the democratic process better than i couldve ever taught them in the classroom
3468963 i learned that i can make a difference even though im not old enough to vote
3468964 mi objetivo es conseguir pasar a la final y luego ya se ver
3468965 ha sido genial quer a nadar solo por delante y lo he conseguido tras los primeros 100 metros
3468966 gaspedals internship was a great experience after being involved in many internships where i sat around and learned nothing gaspedal offered many opportunities to learn and be involved in major projects this internship provided me with an opportunity to come to new york city to work and live if you are interested in a fun place to work and learn i would definitely suggest interning at gaspedal
3468967 my internship at gaspedal was truly an enjoyable and great experience i was involved in everything that was going on and learned first hand about the various aspects of running a business every day i went in i knew i would gain new real life experiences that not only gave me a better grasp on the business world but also gave me an idea of what i will want to pursue in the future i am fortunate to have had an opportunity to intern at gaspedal and would highly recommend it to others
3468968 would not be in the best interest of the community
3468969 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3468970 he told the teller give me all your money and no one will get hurt
3468971 our street is not a thoroughfare even though the truckers like to think it is
3468972 per fare la differenza sottolinea frattini necessario che leuropa rimanga unita cio che non si crei un gruppo antirusso e uno filorusso
3468973 in questa difficilissima situazione litalia ha giocato e sta giocando un ruolo importante sono impegnati in prima fila il presidente berlusconi e il ministro frattini e abbiamo scelto la strada di favorire una posizione unitaria nellue
3468974 lunione europea chiede il segretario delludc lorenzo cesa intervenga per ristabilire lequilibrio violato
3468975 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3468976 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3468977 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3468978 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3468979 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3468980 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3468981 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3468982 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3468983 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3468984 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3468985 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3468986 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3468987 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3468988 personalmente non ho nemmeno visto i blindati ha detto wang se ci sono la decisione stata presa dalle competenti autorit ma non credo siano state rilevate minacce specifiche

3469009 en estos partidos lo nico peligroso es que nosotros no hagamos las cosas bien porque los partidos son f ciles o dif ciles en funci n de c mo lo hagamos nosotros
3469010 cambiar ser a un error porque esa manera de jugar es el camino a seguir
3469011 sabemos que cuando un jugador sube otro tiene que bajar y viceversa y lo estamos haciendo bien hasta el momento
3469012 atacamos como un equipo y defendemos como un equipo si seguimos con este equilibrio seremos un equipo muy dif cil de batir ojal no cambiemos nunca
3469013 con un ochenta o noventa por ciento a nuestro favor
3469014 nos gusta competir y conseguir objetivos y eso pasa por superar este tipo de partidos parece f cil pero se te puede complicar

3469022 la importancia del partido que supone la posibilidad de poder jugar la champions
3469023 nos queda por delante una eliminatoria muy muy dura de jugar
3469024 el hecho de que el wisla haya jugado ya tres partidos oficiales dos de la eliminatoria anterior y uno de la liga polaca le da una cierta ventaja
3469025 el objetivo es ganar y ser a igual si jug ramos fuera de casa
3469026 an act to add agricultural workers to those protected against retaliation in the workplace and to direct the pesticide board to adopt rules requiring licensed pesticide applicators to record the specific time of day when each pesticide application is completed as recommended by the governors task force on preventing agricultural pesticide exposure
3469027 this new law helps us move forward to protect the health of our farm workers
3469028 requiring employers to keep more detailed records of pesticides being used and forbidding retaliation against those who might complain about exposure to these chemicals are important steps toward safety in agricultural workplaces
3469029 there is more to be done and we will continue to develop new health protection measures and work to see they are implemented

3469041 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
3469042 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
3469043 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
3469044 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer
3469045 we have a lot more people coming to our beach and parking than they have which accounts for the increased income
3469046 expenses associated with one year arent necessarily the same as the next
3469047 for example we dont pave the lots every year and the costs cant be limited to just the beach area

3469057 me escucho cuando hablo biniwoo porque siempre es bueno rectificar si me equivoco para eso es bueno poder identificar los fallos algunos de ustedes en cambio sueltan su discursito autocomplaciente y ah queda creyendo que han hecho un gran papel incapaces de reconocer el rid culo se dan la raz n entre s y ya se creen reconocidos por expertos

3469090 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
3469091 its the fucking writers opinion and supposed to be funny
3469092 the democratic party ought to be standing as the bulwark of the little guy against big money and rapacious free market capitalism
3469093 making huggy huggy with all those leftover racists from the segregationist past
3469094 there is only one issue in this election that will matter five or ten years from now and thats the war on terror i say this as a democrat for whom the republican domination of government threatens many values that i hold to be important to americas role as a light among nations but there are no values that matter to me that will not be gravely endangered if we lose this war
3469095 you didnt let your lack of understanding of the concept of
3469096 everyone on earth has a lie clock every time you lie the hands on your clock move
3469097 the hands have never moved indicating that she never told a lie
3469098 the hands have moved twice telling us that abraham told only two lies in his entire life
3469099 how long before married people answer the dictators thus regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn
3469100 omg im lyk so depressed im gona scratch my arm with a safety pin
3469101 it expects everyone to dress well and be on time
3469102 im on ecstasy give me water or else me and the kid will die
3469103 im all for boobies vodka tonics dirty panties and strippers the reason being that they rock especially when combined
3469104 gay is unnatural and brings no children thus endangering our existance
3469105 just thought id mention its not that god hates gays god loves everyone gays rapists murderers jerks at the coffee shop everyone its that being gay or a rapist or a murderer or a jerk is a slap in gods face its breaking his rules hell always forgive us but cmon why be an ass hes a great guy and he deserves a bit more respect
3469106 im a firm believer that people are entitled to their beliefs but with one exception if their beliefs adversely effect someone else
3469107 homosexuals are human beings with as complex a combination of good and evil in them as i find within myself
3469108 how about working on some of those deadly sins before throwing the first stone
3469109 if we allow people of different races to marry eventually pedophiles and zoophiles will be allowed to marry
3469110 if we allow interracial marriage soon well have to legalize homosexual marriage

3469113 all citizens have the right to try and overthrow the government
3469114 liberty and justice for all as long as youre white own property and werent born with a pair of ovaries
3469115 liberty and justice for all unless youre gay non christian or enter an airport
3469116 i agree with o s card that the traditional family of husband wife and children has been taken for granted and abused to the point of it almost being abandoned
3469117 look i really dont think that the government should redefine marriage as a matter of fact i think the government should get out of the marriage business entirely in my opinion the government should only do civil unions and churches should only do marriages
3469118 the thing is marriage is considered to be a religious insitution
3469119 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
3469120 whats next if the states cannot define marriage for themselves then i guess anyone wanting to marry their own 10 year old daughter son must be allowed to do so that may sound ridiculous but think about it if gays are going going to say the state cannot restrict them from being married then hell the pedophile parents of these kids can claim the same exact argument logic be damned
3469121 the first and greatest threat from court decisions in california and massachusetts giving legal recognition to
3469122 there is no act of court or congress that can make these relationships the same as the coupling between a man and a woman
3469123 in this case i would regard orson scott card in the same way i do l ron hubbard i dont give a damn about the political or religious views they put forth from their personal lives theyve still written some damn good literature i dont care about scientology but battlefield earth was an awesome novel
3469124 likewise the entire ender series is fing awesome and doesnt become any less so in light of what the author has said twenty years later
3469125 let me tell you about a book i just read
3469126 im sure therell be a whole cavalcade of comments following this post pointing out the merits of homosexuality its moral deficiency in the eyes of god and stuff about boobies touching and wieners in butts
3469127 orson scott card is a fascist whose books should be burned
3469128 unless im sorely mistaken gods got no problem with it
3469129 do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor homosexuals nor sodomites nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of god
3469130 when the lord your god brings you into the land you are about to enter and occupy he will clear away many nations ahead of you the hittites girgashites amorites canaanites perizzites hivites and jebusites
3469131 and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter
3469132 and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel
3469133 behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
3469134 throughout the history of america the universal historical trend has been towards expanding rights for an expanding number of people
3469135 trashing a writers work because of his beliefs and prompting others to burn his books isnt a little bit extreme
3469136 you are with us or against us you cant just say that you dont care say you love gay people or else you are a homophobic bigot say it loud you heterosexual freak
3469137 slavery was worse than the holocaust and the holocaust was worse than womens lack of rights and womens lack of rights was worse than the oppression of gays
3469138 i hate caucasians because they want to marry our grandmothers and sell themselves for sex and want nothing more than to molest my rabbits evil unwashed folk they are
3469139 i am forced to ask then why in the world would you choose to prioritize the relatively tiny portion about hating and oppressing your fellow men and women instead of giving precedence to the mountain of passages espousing the virtues of love and compassion for all of gods children
3469140 lets squash the issue and bury it deep just say no and then dont say another word ever again
3469141 i belive that as a white man i am superior to all other races especialy blacks and jews and therfore i have the right to controll their reproduction habits
3469142 dude i dont know what circles you move in but a whole lot of folk out there some of them out and out borderline commie liberals who hug trees and chain themselves to coal plant doors and donate to the naacp and aclu dont like the idea of gay marriage
3469143 and no gay marriage is nothing like classic civil rights struggle or black slavery or the holocaust
3469144 know nothing wanna be progressives like this swain dont even realize how offensive it is to compare a struggle of centuries that involved the countless and copious expenditure of tears sweat and blood and literally lives
3469145 w the a piece of that says two dudes who already the right to cohabit and buttfuck each other as much as they want can now call themsselves husband and wife
3469146 its shocking how oh so suave and hip and urbane dipshits like that dont realize how offensive and trivializing of a serious struggle it is to compare gay marriage w civil rights struggle and or the universal fight for freedom from oppression since the time of spartacus through the present
3469147 we are allowing interracial marriage we are allowing gay marriage therefore we must allow pedophile marriage and zoophile marriage
3469148 i am pretty sure there are a lot of homosexuals who find heterosexuality repulsive
3469149 in a hundred years flamboyant gay guys will be getting married in fabulous dresses on your grave and theres absolutely nothing you can do about it
3469150 is it ok for me to be heterosexual am i not allowed to make that choice
3469151 orson scott card blijkt conservatieve lul12 08 2008 om 20 22 door grobbo goede blogpost over ultra conservatieve mormoon gebleken orson scott card enders game die pleit vo homo homoseksualiteit huwelijk mormonen science fiction waan v d dag weblogs terug naar het
3469152 i dont have a problem with black people living together or having their weird sex but i dont think they should be allowed to get married like me why arent they just happy calling it a civil union and leaving it at that theyd have the same rights as me that doesnt mean im racist i just think some things are sacred and black people shouldnt be allowed to call themselves a married couple that should be reserved for a union between a white man and a white woman

3469203 what passengers wont tolerate is train companies using the flexibility allowed them by the system to put up some fares by nearly 11
3469204 nor will they tolerate unregulated fares going up by more than this at a time when high fuel prices mean that more people are travelling by train
3469205 it is a scandal that the rail companies have this trigger which allows them to put up fares every year
3469206 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire and that there is humanitarian aid which we are prepared to provide for those who are casualties of what has been a terrible set of events
3469207 there must now be talks that will resolve this once and for all
3469208 we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem

3469212 too much importance is placed on key stage 3 tests which are no more than a progress check two thirds of the way through secondary education
3469213 the key stage 3 tests are an irrelevance no one will be interested in the results when young people apply for a job

3469243 the concept of operation immortality is much more than a theme to an online game the earths population needs to quickly adjust our behavior regarding global warming or else fiction quickly becomes our new reality when we learned that richard garriott will be conducting environmental research while in space the stars all aligned to support him
3469244 planet make over is about saving the planet the message is serious but the process can and should be fun
3469245 our fit players are good enough to get us into the next round
3469246 we had some attacking problems in our pre season friendlies but that has improved of late as for steaua we watched them last week they have strength in defence and attack
3469247 unfortunately we still alternate between good and bad moments in order to obtain a good result in istanbul we will have to play between good and very good for the entire match without any bad moments
3469248 todays gas price decrease continues to see less of a decrease proportional to the drop in crude oil and nymex gasoline
3469249 the effect of a weakening canadian dollar accounts for some of this but the ability of toronto marketers to pad their wholesale margins have increased three cents per litre the past few weeks alone and the increase in retail margins by 1 5 cents explains the remainder
3469250 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3469251 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3469252 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3469253 people are somewhat brand loyal but people tend to look for the lower price so at this point another factor in their decision making may be well they have gas and they dont so theyll go there
3469254 theres truly an access to health care disparity for these coal producing counties that we need to address
3469255 when theyre not able to provide for their families the stress and depression are going to increase
3469256 if we dont get people in when theyre motivated weve lost them
3469257 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3469258 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3469259 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3469260 the beginning of the competition demands maximum focus and attention
3469261 there is no meaning to winning the national title if you do not qualify for the champions league group stage i hope my players think the same and will do their best to achieve a positive result
3469262 i am not fearful of defeat because i trust my players
3469263 we have had a good start to this season and we also have a lot of enthusiasm fanaticism and collectiveness
3469264 our advantage is that shakhtar have a big imperative for this match
3469265 we will make a first step in kiev i have a recipe for a victory
3469266 jai toujours ambitionn de jouer en quipe nationale et jouer dans le plus grand championnat du monde aston villa va my aider
3469267 but now we will have a completely new approach and the loss against vihren could actually be positive for us this will be a golden chance for us our task is simple we must score as many goals as possible and aim not to concede goals i am sure though the tie will not be decided after the first leg
3469268 bate are a very well organised and balanced side they play a very fast game they run a lot and press the opposition they also know how to keep the ball and they showed their best qualities against anderlecht they scored four goals against the belgian side so they know how to score goals and we must be ready for them
3469269 the chances are 50 50 we are ready for the games i watched levski in their friendly against werder bremen last week and the bulgarian side displayed a very high level of performance every side has strong and weak points and i may say we know everything about levski
3469270 however we have faced even bigger teams in the past so we remain calm
3469271 the offense got off to a slow sloppy start before finishing strong
3469272 our offensive execution needs to improve the defense flew around well our defense is very fast as has been the case for the last four five years safety is solid but we like to rotate four guys and we need some players to step up
3469273 ive always held that a poet should be intellectually isolated even to the point of living on a desert island whenever practicable if he cant be original then id like to know how he can be original when he deliberately fills his head with other peoples stuff
3469274 we were relentlessly trying to change the way the recreation department operated only to be told in a subsequent survey that we were not even addressing the item that public votes showed to be of the highest priority
3469275 t here can be little dispute these days among state and local government officials about the importance of communicating accurate fair and comparable data
3469276 the quality and efficiency of service delivery to citizens d espite the increasing and successful use of performance management among state and local governments there exists no commonly accepted framework or guidelines

3469278 mccain has yet to clearly win the republican vote in any contest this year in south carolina the senators margin came from independents who represented one fifth of the vote the same pattern occurred in new hampshire where mccain and romney evenly split republicans and mccain won by a big margin among independents in michigan romney decisively won republicans on his way to victory there
3469279 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3469280 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3469281 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3469282 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3469283 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3469284 race hatred is a particularly vile american ugliness if the mccain feingold is an assault on the first amendment would mccain nominate judges that might find mf unconstitutional

3469292 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3469293 net als ajax hebben alle grote topclubs in europa selecties met heel veel spelers
3469294 soms betreft het zelfs dertig of vijfendertig spelers voor het eerste elftal niet iedereen heeft dan evenveel kans om te spelen toch zie je daar nooit dat gelouterde spelers van naam zoals kenneth perez worden teruggezet naar een jeugdelftal dat is een stap te ver de coach mag en moet keuzes maken maar de club zorgt voor een waardige oplossing

3469301 the ministry of health set up health centres in catchment areas to serve the population in that area providing outreach services including transportation staffing and drug provision is a challenge drugs needed for treatment might not be available so they have to be referred somewhere else
3469302 the last time drugs were shipped to health centres across sierra leone was july 2006 the basic essential drugs will soon get supplied in the space of the next two weeks the drugs delivered to hastings community health centre were provided by unicef for the children
3469303 maternal and child mortality deaths happen in the rural areas there are several reasons for that transportation finances the belief that hospitalization may not be the best option and delays in taking the right decision mothers might want to diagnose her child herself
3469304 cant afford transport we help them take from the hospital funds from the service fee a certain amount of money from the drug sales go to the desolate people who cant afford we need cooperation help for the hospital

3469314 the style is not as important as the integrity of the design
3469315 people churched or unchurched can tell if it has integrity if it feels right

3469329 every single one of us came out of there crying
3469330 wed give out 300 shoes but pack maybe 500 just so we had enough sizes for everyone
3469331 so at the end we would be packing up shoes to save for the next distribution they didnt understand why we werent giving them out and we couldnt communicate mothers would be begging us to give their kids shoes it was awful
3469332 i played at purdue in front of 14 000 people
3469333 were all used to people cheering for us but this didnt even compare these people werent cheering for us because we played basketball they were excited to see us and knew that we were there to help them it was more than shoes it was love and attention
3469334 they werent people i knew so i just didnt pay any attention
3469335 i dont like your feet touching me i dont like to touch your feet
3469336 then i realized when you washed the feet thats when you got to interact with the kids

3469344 i took my players completely out of their comfort zone to places they didnt know to do things they didnt understand and they were incredible

3469346 i cant think of a day that i havent had at least one box like that arrive
3469347 but now im sitting here trying to figure out how fast i can get these shoes to peru
3469348 we all have a platform its a matter of how we use it
3469349 were asking coaches to use their platform to help children
3469350 i cant tell you what that means to a child
3469351 but you have to put a face to the problem so people understand

3469370 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored

3469378 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3469379 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress
3469380 we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3469381 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3469382 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict
3469383 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and well continue our discussions with all of the parties involved
3469384 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people

3469386 we are turning out to support georgia to show that no state has the right to violate the territorial integrity of another one south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia
3469387 we can see that the eu is an aristocratic republic thats something that ive said many times it cant go on like this
3469388 the halt in operations is of course good news it remains to be seen whether operations will resume
3469389 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims
3469390 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression

3469401 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3469416 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks

3469439 id pay 20 admission to see colin firth dressed like that
3469440 instead of doing this in an ad hoc nature were building a force that understands civil affairs and understands effects based operations
3469441 so they know enough about those areas to be able to go out and do a good assessment
3469442 we have another team that just departed to go to the combined joint task force horn of africa
3469443 theyre going over there to do a 45 day pre deployment site survey in preparation for a commitment where well send two teams in december for a six month deployment

3469449 hi i specialize in providing it services to small business owners i would really like to see see more news and stories on tools and howtos that revolve around the 10 200 person company thank you very much
3469450 how do we share the idea of land value taxation a reform of the property tax with people who are used to hating the property tax
3469451 all your life you have been told that you have to hate the property tax
3469452 the people who order you to hate property taxes most of them paid propagandists for wealthy property owning interests never mention the fact that the property tax is in fact two opposite taxes
3469453 the people who order you to hate the property tax also never tell you another inconvenient fact
3469454 likewise around the world the countries where governments get the most revenue from property taxes including the usa britain japan canada australia and switzerland tend to be the best countries to live in have the highest personal incomes the best economies the lowest unemployment and welfare rates the best public services the least government corruption and so on compared to the countries where governments get little or no revenue from property taxes like the philippines bangladesh mexico zimbabwe and pakistan
3469455 why dont the people who try to make you hate the property tax ever want you to know these facts
3469456 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws

3469533 criticism is mounting that the bush administration didnt do enough to manage its strategic relationship with georgian president mikheil saakashvili and keep him out of trouble
3469534 many officials in the us government who have worked on the russia relationship in recent years said bush lionized mr saakashvili as a model for democracy in the region to a point that the georgian leader may have held unrealistic expectations about the amount of support he might receive from the us and the west

3469585 were already working with autodesk maya and autodesk flame so toxik was a natural choice for our pipeline it gives us the power of a node based compositor necessary for professional high end post production work along with a look and feel thats completely comfortable
3469586 the toxik softwares tight integration with maya and intuitive color correction tools have improved the way i composite toxik lets me focus on finishing shots faster as i no longer have to worry about data management

3469594 as an animator i love the new rigid body physics and rag doll solvers in the 2009 version which help to perfect a multitude of movements that would otherwise be quite painful to capture realistically technical directors will also be happy to see the new python script editor and ability to create custom uis which will allow them to fully integrate motionbuilder into pipelines like ours

3469677 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3469678 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3469679 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3469680 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3469681 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3469682 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress
3469683 we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3469684 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3469685 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict
3469686 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and well continue our discussions with all of the parties involved
3469687 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3469688 we are turning out to support georgia to show that no state has the right to violate the territorial integrity of another one south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia
3469689 we can see that the eu is an aristocratic republic thats something that ive said many times it cant go on like this
3469690 the halt in operations is of course good news it remains to be seen whether operations will resume
3469691 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims
3469692 the un secretary general is concerned about the unfolding humanitarian crisis as a result of fighting in central mindanao an area which has already been affected by conflict for several decades

3469726 we can have the best facilities and the best equipment but if we dont have the best people it wont matter
3469727 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3469728 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3469729 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3469730 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3469731 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years

3469734 dear colleagues along with weyman bennett of unite against fascism uaf i have just met with senior police officers responsible for dealing with the protest scheduled for saturday 16th august 2008 after lengthy and sometimes difficult discussions we have managed to secure agreement with the police for the following protest march and rally meet at codnor market place from 11am for a march that will set off at approx 11 30am the short march through codnor will be followed by a rally of local and national speakers back at codnor market place the rally is scheduled to end around 1 15pm coaches should aim to vacate the specially provided parking provision no later than 2pm this is the only protest supported by the midlands tuc there is nothing else that has been sanctioned by the police or that i am in a position to recommend colleagues to attend further details for this event will be circulated early next week by the organisers of the event uaf we will do our best to make sure this information is circulated widely im sorry for the delay in getting this information to you i hope that you will appreciate that there have been a number of difficulties which has led to the tuc having to get more closely involved i hope that we can get a good trade union turnout to what i now believe will be an effective and safe protest against the bnp regards roger

3469737 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3469738 hagel is still a republican and outside of the iraq issue has major differences with the democratic party in recent years hagel has voted against expanding childrens health insurance for the extending the bush tax cuts a constitutional amendment banning flag burning the oil company tax cuts and subsidies hagel has voted with his party 78 of the time which according to statistics kept by the washington post is only 3 3 below the republican average

3469743 stop me if youve heard this a history and philosophy of jokes
3469744 its the only domain of creative activity where a very complex cerebral stimulus a little bit of nonsense will elicit this massive and grossly physiological response
3469745 when people finally told 9 11 jokes i mean what a relief
3469746 and holocaust jokes sometimes its the only way to provide relief in a sort of therapeutic way
3469747 im hoping that there might be a harmony between the values of humour and morality
3469748 but i feel certain this isnt the case i think there are probably deeply immoral jokes that are very funny

3469753 each case is considered on an individual basis any reduction on the basis of alcohol consumption alone is not appropriate and this most certainly does not and should not apply to victims of rape

3469762 there are a number of stories as to how south west rocks got its name but one of the most favoured is that the captains of passing ships where told it was safest to moor their vessels near the rocks south west of laggers point the point on which trial bay gaol is built
3469763 the most favoured story that i have encountered from living there for 18 years is that captain cook visited the area and named it after the large rocks on what is today
3469764 a new area for south west rocks has been proposed for the land around saltwater creek west of arakoon which will house a new shopping centre and around a thousand houses the local council is yet to approve this application

3469768 the first computer generated images were created in the early 1960s they were simple abstract drawings and animated images since then digital art has evolved into a sophisticated and highly elaborate art form
3469769 digital art in all its forms is gaining prominence among artists curators and audiences
3469770 new media art encompasses the use of digital technologies and the internet as media but new media art is more than these
3469771 even paint on canvas can be controlled digitally using common illustration software such as creol draw adobe illustrator maya and many more you can actually paint an entire using only an electronic pen hooked up to a pad

3469780 weve got offices across the state and a very robust operation
3469781 it came about through one of the guys who used to work in my band nat augustin who approached me about doing a covers album for emi and as id never done an album of other peoples material before i felt it was a great opportunity to do some of the great songs that id heard and have a lotta respect for so we started off with about 35 to 40 songs and then we scaled it down what i particularly didnt want was to do karaoke versions of the originals verbatim i did wanna put an alexander oneal touch on everything that i did so overall i just thought it was just a great opportunity because i do wanna keep putting as much stuff into my legacy as i possibly can you know i always knew id get a deal with a major again i just didnt realise it would take 11 years
3469782 well i like to let people know that you cant just stereotype me to r amp b music because i like all kinds i like folk i like country i like bluegrass to me if its a great song its a great song so this album was an opportunity for me to show my fans that while i am of course most comfortable and at home doing r amp b i do consider myself a universal singer for example my favourite cover on the album is take thats a million love songs which to me is a great timeless song to where i actually now include it in my live shows and every time i do it its received well like the other night we did a show up in highgate and it got me a standing ovation
3469783 one of the things thats so important to me about my uk fans is their loyalty while in america youre only as big as your last record my british fans have been there for me through ups downs regardless of what the situation has been also i like the fact that they grow up with you they grow older with you and they dont stop coming to your shows you know one thing i love about the british people period is they dont give up their social life whereas in america when you reach a certain age you trade all that in for a remote control and a couch and the main reason i think the british fans have kept coming to my shows for over 20 years is down to my consistency when they come to see me they know theyre gonna get my heart and soul ive never ever compromised my band or my sound for money or anything else and in addition to the longstanding fans theres also a lotta new ones coming along today too you know because theres a lotta baby boomers that grew up on alexander oneal im now seeing people bringing mothers im seeing older people middle aged people young people all age groups and to be recognised as the r amp b singer in their hearts for me is an absolute honour
3469784 my morals and values were formed long before i had a record deal so when stardom came i was never astounded or taken aback by it with my mississippi upbringing being so down to earth thats pretty much the type of person ive always tried to present myself as im a peoples person im not the type of artist thats unapproachable and walks around with a bunch of bodyguards but yeah i guess we grew up in a poor environment with my mother head of a household of six kids but at the same time i dont ever remember going to bed hungry because one thing about growing up in mississippi is the way the families all network whatever one person dont have they can always get from someone else in the family because theres a lot of sharing going around and though never having a father he died while my mother was pregnant with me meant i did grow up kinda sad at times his side of the family pretty much took on his role by teaching me to express love as a man and that kinda stuff and it was actually through playing american football that i started really finding myself i actually ended up going to college on an athletic football scholarship
3469785 after a year i quit football because i just wasnt prepared for college from an academic point of view affirmative action hadnt really taken place at that time in america so i came up in an era where school wise they tended to just push you through and i had no idea how to study i basically had no work ethic so from there i went all around mississippi doing different jobs working in a shipyard down on the gulf coast and just endless other jobs before i ended up just hanging around on the corner doing nothing then one day it was like nine in the morning and i was the only one on the corner an older relative was getting ready for work and he was like boy i want you to get off that corner youre going up to chicago where youre gonna make somethin of yourself you come from too good a family to be standing around like that so that affected me and when my uncle came home for christmas i made that move from mississippi to chicago but then when i got to chicago i found myself in the urban ghetto so i was like this cant be my destiny i didnt come all the way from mississippi to be working in a factory and get killed in westside chicago so consequently one morning i called my cousin up in minneapolis and by nine oclock that night i was on the bus and it was then after moving to minneapolis that my musical career really took off
3469786 minneapolis is probably the most interracial city in the united states so that was a different thing for me to adapt to were talking 1974 75 and back then it was a tough time for black musicians in minneapolis simply because the black community itself there was so small but then when prince finally cracked it open it kinda gave us all a little more incentive to say ok it can be done you can come out of this area and be successful you dont have to be from new york or la and thats when it all started getting serious i basically made up my mind that for me it was gonna be music or nothing i was like im gonna put 10 years into this music industry and if it dont work out in 10 years im going to truck driving school in wisconsin so i put my own band together the black market band and at first we were so poor i used to sing through the bass amp but though it was a rough time it was a fun time then next i released a local record called playroom which kinda pulled me to another level i became a local star and that in turn definitely prepared me for the international stardom when it finally came
3469787 flyte tyme was a wonderful band and i felt we were on our way to getting a national deal you know id been picked to be the lead singer in a group owned by prince wed started recording at princes house but then i got kicked out the band before i got kicked in some people said it was because i was too black in skin pigmentation but i still think it was because i was opinionated id started showing i could think and started asking questions about the financial arrangements but you know to be kicked out was heart breaking and the main thing i couldnt respect about it was that prince hadnt been man enough to tell me because all of a sudden flyte tyme started rehearsing behind my back so they could become the time without me and all this time we were still doing gigs together you know theyd suddenly start mixing these new songs into the set and id be like wheres this coming from and the only one out of all of them with the balls to tell me what was happening was terry lewis but though when i got the news i was really hurt a lotta times good things come out of a bad situation and that was just fuel for the fire for me because i felt that if i was good enough to even be considered for a group by prince then i must be good enough for the music industry and when jimmy jam and terry lewis came home from la one summer night after theyd got kicked outta the time by prince they came into this club i was performing at in downtown minneapolis and were like alex when we get our plans off the ground were gonna get you a record deal and thats exactly what they did
3469788 it was one of the best experiences in my life man what a ride and one of the advantages we had was that we as the flyte tyme family always took care of each other when we did interviews we always talked about each other we always kept each other in the mix which i think contributed to jam amp lewis becoming star producers you know a lotta times producers are in the background and not out there in the public eye but by just constantly talking about each other we contributed to each others stardom
3469789 the nineties period definitely did affect me you know its a shame when record companies wont let you sell records to your own fans i dont know why but for some reason they just started looking for the one hit wonders that were in and out of the industry in a flash i mean i was with sony for six years straight and you think as an artist when youre up on that level that everythings an automatic and its gonna be like that forever but its really not the lights will change and theyll show you that things will change and what do you do when things change you know fortunately when i started my career i deliberately worked on worldwide appeal england was my springboard from there i did europe and i ended up playing all over the world and its that working onstage across the globe that has kept me busy to this day but yeah the nineties was a rough period you know they kept pushing soul artists like me down away from the mainstream further into the background further into the background so eventually i stopped concerning myself about what id already had because if as an artist you get that once in your career then you should consider yourself blessed and lucky but right now with things seeming to go full circle im definitely looking for the next time around
3469790 ive been spending so much time here in the uk lately and during that time ive come across so many great songs so many great writers so many great musicians so right now im excited about putting the next alexander oneal album together by using both uk and american producers and musically i feel it has to be uptempo so we can challenge the charts we can challenge the remixers and we can get on the dancefloor you know ive always tried to stay away from the stereotypical balladeer thing ive just done the covers record so this next album is gonna have to be hard i really think my fans in the street that generation that grew up with me need something to identify me with for right here and right now ive got to challenge myself to come up with the right album and the right concept particularly with the kinda profile ive had this last year i think ive probably been on british television more than other black man during the last 12 months the type of coverage and respect ive had from the uk media has been phenomenal you know things are constantly rolling right now im doing celebrity wife swap with my lovely wife for the week jilly goolden im feeling good my voice is sounding great so gods been good to me and i just plan to keep on moving forward
3469791 aku sedang takut bila aku melakukan kemungkaran lalu tidak ada orang yang melarangku melakukannya karena segan dan rasa hormatnya kepadaku
3469792 demi allah jika aku melihatmu keluar dari kebenaran aku pasti akan mencegahmu
3469793 alhamdulillah yang menjadikan untukku sahabat sahabat yang siap meluruskanku jika aku menyimpang
3469794 orang yang merasa terluka karena dosa dan jika ia ingat dosanya ia memandang kecil amal perbuatannya
3469795 sesungguhnya orang orang yang berpaling di antara kalian pada hari bertemu dua pasukan itu mereka digelincirkan oleh setan karena sebagian kesalahan yang telah mereka perbuat di masa lampau
3469796 demi allah aku tidak peduli dengan banyaknya kemungkaran dan dosa yang paling aku takutkan ialah keakraban hati dengan kemungkaran dan dosa sebab jika sesuatu dikerjakan dengan rutin maka jiwa menjadi akrab dengannya dan jika demikian jiwa menjadi tidak memiliki kepekaan lagi
3469797 ketahuilah ujian paling besar bagi seseorang adalah merasa aman dan tidak mendapatkan siksa setelah mengerjakan dosa bisa jadi hukuman datang belakangan dan hukuman paling berat adalah jika seseorang tidak merasakan hukuman itu sampai hukuman itu menghilangkan agama mencampakkan hati hingga tak bisa menentukan pilihan yang baik dan di antara efek hukuman ini adalah seseorang tetap melakukan dosa justru disaat tubuhnya segar bugar dan seluruh keinginannya tercapai

3469803 siapa yang ingin keburukannya dibalas oleh allah dengan kebaikan hendaknya ia juga membalas keburukan orang lain dengan kebaikan dan siapa yang mengetahui bahwa dosa dan keburukan itu pasti ada pada diri manusia ia tidak terkejut dengan sikap buruk orang kepadanya
3469804 sesungguhnya allah telah membeli dari orang orang mukmin diri dan harta mereka dengan memberikan surga untuk mereka mereka berperang pada jalan allah lalu mereka membunuh atau terbunuh itu telah menjadi janji yang benar dari allah di dalam taurat injil dan al quran dan siapakah yang lebih menepati janjinya selain daripada allah maka bergembiralah dengan jual beli yang telah kamu lakukan itu dan itulah kemenangan yang besar

3469835 if medical researchers were to discover an elixir that could increase life expectancy reduce the burden of illness delay the consequences of aging decrease risky health behavior and shrink disparities in health we would celebrate such a remarkable discovery robust epidemiological evidence suggests that education is such an elixir yet health professionals rarely identified improving school graduation rates as a major public health objective nor have they systematically examined their role in achieving this objective

3469839 or light your back is a force multiplier thats what a lever is
3469840 with the spine we want to reduce the amount of leverage reduce the lever arm by using our legs and squatting to lift something from the ground by keeping the back straight or more upright we reduce the pressure on the lower back

3469992 i completed a few balls and i am having fun running around with these guys and filling in where i can
3469993 just understanding the entire route running stuff and what is going on in their head it definitely helps
3469994 he has a longer background in knowing the offense and knowing the terminology and all of that stuff
3469995 he is very comfortable calling the plays in the huddle and he is a good athlete we are lucky to have him jump in there
3469996 i dont know if that will get me up in the starting position
3469997 i looked at everything thats our job to make sure
3469998 we followed pretty much the same routine but were going to research everything we do it seems like last year was a high ankle sprain two years ago was the shoulder five acls thats a tough deal
3469999 its frustrating when guys are hurt but at our staff meeting this morning i drew up our offensive line and drew up everybody when theyre healthy and its a pretty good football team
