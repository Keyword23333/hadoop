6980012 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fiber consumption on global water resources
6980013 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6980014 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fiber crops that people in britain subsequently consume
6980015 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6980016 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibers we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn

6980125 were you nervous before the beatles 1964 debut on the ed sullivan show
6980126 the sullivan show was funny because i didnt attend the rehearsal i was sick somehow on the flight over on the first trip to the states the band did play alot of rehersal for the sound people they kept going into the control room and checking out the sound and finally when they got a balance between the instruments and the vocals they marked on the boards by the control and then everybody broke for lunch then we came back to tape the show and the cleaners had been round and polished all the marks off the board it was sort of a bit tacky in those days with the sound people would put amplifiers off to the side of the stage so it didnt spoil the shot you know
6980127 oh yeah we did but we knew wed had sufficient success in europe and britain to have a bit of confidence and we really needed a helluva lot of confidence for the states because it was such an important place i mean nobodyd ever made it you know british acts apart from the odd singer like lonnie donnegan
6980128 but ed sullivan was you know everybody had told us how he was really big but again we were pretty naive to certain things so that helped at the time i remember them asking us did we know who walter cronkite was and i said i dunno isnt he somebody on the television you know things like that were good because they all had fun the people asking questions and the press us being naive and not seeming to care about that sort of thing
6980129 was there ever a tendency to still act naive after you wised up
6980130 i dunno but by that time wed got into that whole sort of routine that we used to have you know at press conferences alot of it was just nervous energy just for jokes and stuff which everybody seemed to like that was one of the big helps for the beatles at the time if anybody dried up in the press conferences there was always somebody else there with a smart answer there was always a good balance so nobody could ever really quite nail us
6980131 the sullivan show was just the climax to the beatles whole america thing
6980132 because the answer is just like going back to school again really the four of us are so tied up with our own lives and its been eight years since we split and time goes so fast its not beyond the bounds of possibility but wed have to want to do it for the musics sake first we wouldnt stick together because somebody had put an ad in the paper putting us on the spot
6980133 somebody in new york is saying the beatles are getting back together to wrestle a great white shark in australia
6980134 that was the other guy he was gonna try and do the beatles show and then try and do the other one with somebody fighting a shark i thought if he fights the shark the winner can be the promoter
6980135 it seemed that all four of you were locked into something larger than its parts
6980136 it was but none of us really thought about leaving until 67 or 68 which was after we stopped touring i know the first time for me which was the most depressing was during the white album it was a problem making a double album because it takes such a long time
6980137 i think it was because there were so many songs but it was a period that had started a bit negative it was a bit difficult and we got through it and it was fine we finally got through the album and everybody was pleased because the track were good then i worked on an album with jackie lomax on an apple record and i spent a long time in the states and i had such a good time working with all these different musicians and different people then i hung out at woodstock for thanksgiving and you know i felt really good at that time i got back to england for christmas and then on january 1st we were to start on the thing which turned into let it be and straight away again it was just weird vibes you know i found i was starting to be able to enjoy being a musician but the moment i got back with the beatles it was just too difficult there were just too many limitations based upon our being together for so long everybody was sort of pigeon holed it was frustrating
6980138 the problem was that john and paul had written songs for so long it was difficult first of all because they had such alot of tunes and they automatically thought that theirs should be priority
6980139 while my guitar gently weeps we recorded it one night and there was such a lack of enthusiasm so i went home really disappointed because i knew the song was good
6980140 the next day i brought eric clapton with me he was really nervous i was saying just come and play on the session then i can sing and play acoustic guitar because what happened when eric was there on that day and later on when billy preston i pulled in billy preston on let it be it helped because the others would have to control themselves a bit more john and paul mainly because they had to you know act more handsomely eric was nervous saying no what will they say and i was saying fuck em thats my song you know he was the first non beatle person whod ever played on anything
6980141 and it was a good date paul would always help along when youd done his ten songs then when he got round to doing one of my songs he would help it was silly it was very selfish actually sometimes paul would make us do these really fruity songs i mean my god maxwells silver hammer was so fruity after a while we did a good job on it but when paul got an idea or an arrangement in his head but pauls really writing for a 14 year old audience now anyhow i missed his last tour unfortunately
6980142 while my guitar gently weeps was such a personal song id always wondered why eric was there
6980143 well id been through this sitar thing id played sitar for three years and id just listened to classical indian music and practiced sitar except for when we played dates studio dates and then id get the guitar out and just play you know learn a part for the record but id really lost alot of interest in the guitar i remember i came from california and i shot this piece of film for the film on ravi shankars life called raga and i was carrying a sitar and we stopped in new york and checked in a hotel and jimi hendrix and eric clapton were both at the same hotel and that was the last time i really played the sitar like that we used to hang out such alot at that period and eric gave me a fantastic les paul guitar which is the one he plays on that date so it worked out well i liked the idea of other musicians contributing
6980144 i helped eric write badge you know each of them had to come up with a song for that goodbye cream album and eric didnt have his written we were working across from each other and i was writing the lyrics down and we came to the middle part so i wrote bridge eric read it upside dwn and cracked up laughing whats badge he said after that ringo walked in drunk and gave us that line about the swans living in the park
6980145 i always thought your contributions guided the bands direction beatles 65 the country influence or the indian influence
6980146 well ringo as well you know we all gave as much as we could the thing was paul and john wrote all the songs in the beginning and they did write great songs which made it more difficult to break in or get some action on the songwriting thing but you know we all did contribute such alot to the beatles there was a period of time when people thought ringo doesnt play the drums i dont know what they thought of me but they tended to think it was john and paul for a period of time
6980147 i helped out such alot in all the arrangements there were alot of tracks though where i played bass paul played lead guitar on taxman and he played guitar a good part on drive my car
6980148 no i didnt play we laid the track because what paul would do if hes written a song hed learn all the parts for paul and then come in the studio and say do this hed never give you the opportunity to come out with something but on drive my car i just played the line which is really like a lick off respect you know the otis redding version and i played that line on guitar and paul laid that with me on bass we laid the track down like that we played the lead part later on top of it there were alot of things like on a couple of dates paul wasnt on it at all or john wasnt on it at all or i wasnt on it at all probably only about five tunes altogether where one of us might not have been on
6980149 which of the beatles albums do you still listen to
6980150 we put all the songs together into an album form im talking about english albums now because in the states we found later that for every two albums we had they capitol would make three because we put fourteen tracks on an album and wed also have singles that werent included on albums in those days theyd put the singles on take off a bunch of tracks change all the running order and then theyd make new packages like yesterday and today just awful packages
6980151 that entire era was so productive did it seem that way to you
6980152 yeah it was good it was enjoyable wed get into doing harmonies and this and that beacause in the early days we were only working on four track tapes so what wed do would be work out most of the basic track on one track get all the balance and everything set all the instruments then wed do all the vocals or overdub if there was guitar lines would come in on the second verse and piano in the middle eight with shakers and tambourines wed line up and get all the sounds right and do it in a take and then do all the vocal harmonies over
6980153 those old records werent really stereo they were mono records and they were rechanneled some of the stereo is terrible because youve got backing on one side in fact when we did the first two albums at least the first album which was please please me we did it straight onto a two track machine so there wasnt any stereo as such it was just the voices on one track and the backing on the other sgt pepper was only a four track
6980154 yup well we had an orchestra on a separate four track machine in day in the life we tried to sync them up i remember they kept going out of sync in playback so we had to remix it
6980155 was the rest of the band difficult when you started getting into indian music
6980156 not really they werent really as interested when id first met ravi shankar he played a private concert just at my house and he came with alla rakha and john and ringo came to that i know ringo didnt want to know about tabla because it just seemed so far our to him
6980157 well he could relate to it as a percussion instrument as drums but how rakha actually played it he couldnt figure that out at all but they liked it they knew there was something great about it but they werent into it as i was then they all went to india and had those experiences in india too which for anybody who goes to india i think straight away you can relate much more to indian music because it makes so much more sense having been there
6980158 was it intimidating to start out at age 17 or 18 and be younger than the others
6980159 no there are around nine months between me and paul nine months between paul and john in the early days when i was still at school i was really small i sort of grew in height when we were away in hamburg a few years before that we did a few parties at night just silly things john paul and i and there were a couple of other people who kept coming and going john was in school the college of art which was adjoining our school paul and i would sneak out of our school and go into his place which was a bit more free you know ours was still in school uniforms and we could smoke in his place and do all that i think he did feel a bit embarrassed about that because i was so tiny i only looked about ten years old
6980160 but in hamburg we were living right in the middle of st paulie which is right in the middle of the reeperbahn district in hamburg all the club owners were like gangsters and all the waiters had tear gas guns truncheons knuckle dusters they were a heavy crew everybody around that district were homosexuals pimps hookers you know being in the middle of that when i was 17 laughs it was good fun but when we moved into our second club we were becoming so popular with the crowd of regulars that we never got in any problems with all these gangster sort of people they never tried to beat us up because they knew the beatles and you know theyd say pedels pronounced peedles thats german for prick
6980161 in the hamburg days we had to play so long and really rock it up and leap about and foam at the mouth and do whatever
6980162 but a year or so after that when brian epstein came on the scene he said you should smarten up because nobody wants to know you tv producers or record producers or whatever we just looked too scruffy in germany they had alot of leather stuff like black leather trousers and jackets and boots
6980163 i just had a good time just playing you know thats what i miss even when we sold records and started doing alot of tours it was a bit of a drag because wed go on the road and wed play the same tunes to different people and then wed drop a few and add the new ones all the time it got stale i felt stale you know because you play the same riffs da da ding ding dow you know twist and shout and things by the time you came off the road touring the world id just want to not particularly
6980164 yeah for a while and so we did get very stale and thats a period when i was saying about after being into the sitar i got really friendly with eric and all the kids were playing guitars id felt as though id missed so many years out
6980165 you mean like hendrix and cream and that whole era
6980166 yeah and all the young kids coming up were all playing so good and i hadnt been involved with it for so long both being in the beatles just playing the same old tunes and playing indian music so i felt a long way behind that was one reason why i had all the instruments i suddenly realized i dont like these guitars and eric gave me this les paul which really got me back into it because it sounded so funky that was one of the reasons i started playing slide you know because i felt so far behind in playing hot licks with slide i didnt have any instruction i just got one and started playing
6980167 i just had to force myself back alot of it was just confidence
6980168 john said the best beatle music happened before the group ever cut a record
6980169 mmm well yes i think some of the best stuff we did was when we stopped touring and spent alot of time in the studio you know we lived in a studio really alot of things which were innovations as far as recording went i think that was some of the best music but as far as playing live i agree with what john says about the old days we were really rocking we had fun you know we really had fun
6980170 since youve gone solo your signiture musically is different from that now
6980171 that was the song when i left from the let it be movie theres a scene where paul and i are having an argument and were trying to cover it up then the next scene im not there and yokos just screaming doing her screeching number well thats where id left and i went home to write wah wah it had given me a wah wah like i had such a headache with that whole argument it was such a headache
6980172 we were in the hammersmith odeon and the yardbirds were sort of supporting a group on the bill and i just met him then but really didnt get to know him i met him again when the lovin spoonful were at the marquee and john and i went down and were just sort of hanging about backstage with them we were going down to their hotel i can remember just seeing eric i know him im sure i know this guy and he seems like you know really lonely i remember we went out and got in a car and went off to sebastians hotel and i remembered thinking we shouldve invited that guy cuz im sure we know him from somewhere and he just seemed like lonely
6980173 and then a couple of years maybe a year or so later the bee gees the cream were all involved with brian epstein originally so i started meeing eric and hanging out with him then at brian epsteins house we sort of went out quite a bit with brian for dinner and stuff and then the whole cream thing started happening through that period he played guitar gently weeps and after that he just escaped out of london because some cop was after him and he bought a house just a bit further out in the country from where i was and we used to hang out
6980174 savoy truffle on the white album was written for eric hes got this real sweet tooth and hed just had his mouth worked on his dentist said he was through with candy so as a tribute i wrote youll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle the truffle was some kind of sweet just like all the rest cream tangerine ginger sling just candy to tease eric
6980175 i remember him saying he was dedicating layla to some mystery woman did you know what was happening
6980176 you said all things must pass was like as explosion for you
6980177 yeah i had alot from during the beatles time and i was writing all the time and i wrote a few while making the album as well
6980178 no not particularly i liked different songs for different reasons i liked the first song that was on the album id have you anytime and particularly the recording of it because derek and the dominoes played on most of the tracks and it was a really nice experience making that album because i was really a bit paranoid musically having this whole thing with the beatles had left me really paranoid i remember having those people in the studio and thinking god these songs are so fruity i cant think of which song to do slowly i realized we can do this one and id play it to them and theyd say wow yeah great song and id say really do you really like it i realized that it was okay that they were sick of playing all that other stuff its great to have a tune and i liked that song id have you anytime because of bob dylan
6980179 i was with bob and hed gone through his broken neck period and was being very quiet and he didnt have much confidence anyhow thats the feeling i got with him in woodsock
6980180 he sang for me love is all you need makes the world go round love and only love cant be denied no matter what you think about it youre not going to be able to live without it take a tip from one whos tried and i thought isnt it great because i know people are going to think shit whats dylan doing but as far as i was concerned it was great for him to realize his own peace and it meant something you know hed always been so hard and i thought alot of people are not going to like this but i think its fantastic because bob has obviously had the experience i was saying to him you write incredible lyrics and he was saying how do you write those tunes so i was just showing him chords like crazy chords because he tended just to play alot of basic chords and move a capo up and down and i was saying come on write me some words and he was scribbling words down and it just killed me because hed been doing all these sensational lyrics and he wrote all i have is yours all you see is mine and im glad to hold you in my arms id have you anytime the idea of dylan writing something like so very simple
6980181 did you get any feedback from john or ringo or anybody saying congratulations
6980182 i remember john was really negative at the time but i was away and he came round to my house and there was a friend of mine living there who was a friend of johns he saw the album cover and said he must be fucking bad putting three records out and look at the picture on the front he looks like an asthmatic leon russell there was alot of negativity going down you know ringo played on almost the whole album i dont care about that fuck it weve been through the thing i felt that whatever happened whether it was a flop or a success i was gonna go on my own just to have a bit of peace of mind
6980183 so you werent apprehensive about how it would go over
6980184 no not at all i felt it was good music whether people bought it or not i was concerned that the musicians who played on it were concerned it was good
6980185 by the time it was finished you were confident it was good
6980186 even before i started i knew i was gonna make a good album because i had so many songs and i had so much energy for me to do my own album after all that it was joyous dream of dreams
6980187 lets move ahead on the new album ive never been able to figure out whether youre talking about krishna or a woman
6980188 ultimately the love can become so big that we can love the whole of creation instead of i love this but i dont like that singing to the lord or an individual is in way the same ive done that consciously in some songs
6980189 ive had alot of interest in different ways and one of the things i never liked was the whole bit in the late 60s when everybody started getting into it one thing i really disliked was this my gurus better than your guru its like little kids on the street my dads bigger than your dad the point is that there is only one god hes got millions of names but theres only but theres only one god all maharishi ever gave me was good advice and he gave me the technique of meditation which is really wonderful
6980190 well you know john went through a negative thing moreso than i did with the maharishi i can see now much clearer what happened and there was still just alot of ignorance that went down maharishi was fantastic and i admire him like prabhupada for being able in spite of all the ridicule to just keep going and theres more people now especially in the united states who are all doing it and in the 60s they were laughing at us saying it was stupid all of these people have influenced me and ive tried to the best out of all of them without getting spitiual indegestion
6980191 what about your albums like living in the material world the whole concept of maya its so ironic that you got caught up in it
6980192 oh yeah im living in it but people interpret it to mean money cars that sort of thing although those are part of the material world the material world is like the physical world as opposed to the spiritual for me living in the material world just meant being in this physical body with all the things that go along with it
6980193 the litigation involved in the concert for bangladesh didnt that depress you
6980194 yeah that is sure enough to make you go crazy and commit suicide the whole thing of being beatles it was very heavy on us four it was like some people wrote saying well the problem with the beatles is that when we were all growing up they were just tooling round the world in limosines actually it was the reverse we were forced to grow up much faster and what they call growing up was actually being stuck in a rut while we were transcending layer upon layer so the heaviness of just the things weve been through we either use it or rise above it or it pulls you down for me its like it makes me have to call upon the inner me for the strength in order to rise above it because that part is the maya whereas if you just cop out it doesnt do anybody any good
6980195 is it a prioity to go round the world being a rock amp roll star thats what im saying theres no time to lose really and theres gonna have to be a point where ive got to drag myself away and try and fulfill whatever i can
6980196 there are alot of people in the business that i love friends you know who are really great but who dont have any desire for knowledge or realization its good to boogie once and a while but when you boogie all your life away its just a waste of life and of what weve been given i can get high like the rest of them but its actually low the more dope you take the lower you get really having done that i can say that from experience whatever it is you just need more and the more you take the worse you get
6980197 i used to have an experience when i was a kid which used to frighten me i realized years later in meditation that i had the same experience id feel really tiny and at the same time id feel i was a whole thing as well it was feeling like two different things at the same time and this little thing with this feeling would vibrate right through me and it would start getting bigger and bigger and faster and faster until it was going so far and getting so fast that it was mind boggling and id come out of it really scared
6980198 i used to get that experience alot when we were doing abbey road recording id go into this big empty studio and get into a soundbox inside of it and do my meditation inside of there and i had a couple of indications of that same experience which i realized was what i had when i was a kid
6980199 id go up there and watch her play and she was terrific
6980200 she didnt teach me all bout the guitar just the chords and i learned the rest myself
6980201 if i were in the south now id be dead im too color blind someone pushes me ill fight him i dont care who he is
6980202 the musicians were all too busy running around drinking and gambling
6980203 he went there every morning and spent three hours writing his tunes
6980204 hed set up his fotdella and all of his stuff and sit there and compose with a tape recorder and get his stuff down
6980205 i dont drink or smoke anymore and that does make a difference johnson says from
6980206 i would think that had something to do with the way im singing but then
6980207 fast and funky recently reissued by the baltimore blues society poorly distributed
6980208 when you take a look at the black guys we
6980209 theres no mama and daddy to run to of any wealth
6980210 me i didnt particularly care about that ive always been the self independent type
6980211 i wasnt getting the work that my competitors was getting and i wasnt getting
6980212 so i made a decision that i wasnt gonna wear myself out
6980213 when you find a person that say they cant get along
6980214 im a black man doing a black tradition that was done many years before me and im
6980215 as for black people there is no way a generation of
6980216 me i dont even go to these festivals unless im on them theres nothing for me to do
6980217 i feel like i was chosen for this by something
6980218 like this is my calling whether i like it or not the difficult thing as
6980219 you hear elvis presley you hearin big boy crudup you hear big boy you hearin big bill he was my man
6980220 you couldnt pay one of them fellows to play a song like that
6980221 it dont take but five verses to make a blues think of five things you can do with something and you got a blues
6980222 the younger people say youre crying when youre singing like that
6980223 who wants to cry back in those days people didnt know nothing else to do but cry they couldnt say about things that hurt them but now they talks and they gets lawyers and things they dont cry no more so thats why they dont play em like this
6980224 oh no not today not when ive got a kid with me
6980225 do as you will so long as it harms nobody
6980226 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6980227 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6980228 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6980229 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6980230 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6980231 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6980232 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6980233 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6980234 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6980235 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6980236 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6980237 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6980238 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

6980268 its meant to make you feel good and everybody can relate to it i love all kinds of music and ive been influenced by all of it

6980582 i was asked before coming to beijing what my wish for these games was and i answered that it would be ireland going through the three weeks without being tainted by any hint of doping
6980583 we have to get answers the irish sports council is responsible for the testing of athletes and they do a very good job of it procedures are followed rigorously we want the same standards to apply to equestrian sports and right now that doesnt seem the case
6980584 that to me must be a serious worry to the whole horse industry in ireland because it seems to be constantly under the microscope these days

6980649 we made the decision to get him out of there after 93 pitches wanted to make sure we sent him out on a clean note feeling good about his performance with a win
6980650 we made the decision to get him out and turned out it cost us some runs and made for kind of a hairy situation
6980651 i thought green was a little upset that i took him out of the game and i was just explaining to him that this is not the time to be upset with me
6980652 youd better pitch better than that if you want to stay in the game
6980653 its been a rough year physically and mentally i walked the leadoff hitter and then to be able to get out of it with a ground ball was huge
6980654 i ended up going 3 0 and worked my way back to a full count and struck him out looking
6980655 that was definitely a huge point in the game for me and for the team i think momentum wise
6980656 we got a win as a team i went out and pitched five good innings we played hard and had good defensive plays and had timely hitting
6980657 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine

6980668 kami kesal kerana pihak universiti menolak pandangan kami sedangkan yang hendak mengenakan pakaian tersebut adalah kalangan mahasiswa bahkan dengan kos rm2 1 juta yang dihabiskan ianya suatu pembaziran
6980669 pihak universiti telah terlebih awal merancang membuat keputusan ini selain menyelaraskan pakaian ini dengan institusi pengajian tinggi
6980670 saya tahu bukan mahasiswa sahaja tidak bersetuju bahkan pensyarah dan kakitangan pun ada yang bantah pembaharuan ini
6980671 ianya bukan bermaksud membuang nilai islam dalam majlis istiadat tahunan ini tetapi ia adalah proses biasa
6980672 kalau nak kata ia bukan imej islam kita tak perlu adakan majlis secara besar besaran seumpama sebelum ini

6980680 the cs3s were in fact very easy to locate for optimum sound
6980681 the cs3s sound would best be described as rich and a little polite rather than authoritative and startlingly alive it still had that remarkably extended and clean high end very punchy and deep low end and pinpoint imaging
6980682 the cs3 goes both lower and higher than most other speaker systems

6980697 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6980698 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6980699 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6980719 weve got so many guys coming back especially on offense that we pretty much know what those guys can do
6980720 we want to use this scrimmage to take a look at some of the new guys on the roster and see where they might fit in
6980721 we really want to get a look at our kickoff and kick return teams our punting and punt cover units and our field goals units
6980722 especially in this economy the way it is this needs to happen much more
6980723 we spend a lot on clothes probably 2 000 a year on clothes and shoes because they turn over so quickly
6980724 they lose them they ruin them the dog chews them
6980725 we save and save and we come here and spend
6980726 its expensive nowadays you can only go so many places without running out of gas and baby stuffs extremely expensive
6980727 i have six children myself this was a huge savior
6980728 franchise businesses can grow rapidly to respond to growing consumer needs
6980729 logic will tell you theres a demand here and theres also potential for growth
6980730 where else can you get two gap dresses for the price of a gallon of milk
6980731 and to go out here and learn this offense and get better and better and i dont think that changes no matter what they decide
6980732 the similarities between downtown los angeles and broadway in particular are very striking to what existed here in san diego they took what was a blighted area with a lot of potential and made it into an active lively entertainment destination that is a true neighborhood
6980733 what is amazing to me is how theyve integrated older structures with new structures and at the same time provided multiple means of public transportation
6980734 we tell people you ought to save a little yourself
6980735 two gold medals ive got to tell you it doesnt get any better than that
6980736 we dont care if theyre russian or chinese or american
6980737 i want to show that the technology does exist and theres a very viable product
6980738 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6980739 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6980740 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6980741 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6980742 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6980743 i think i have a much higher i q than you do a bizarre videotaped putdown that biden immediately called into question with five 5 boasts about his academic record four 4 of which turned out to be easily disproved b s immediate reaction from the mccain camp tonight

6980746 all in all a very nice holiday lovely cottage friendly and welcoming people wonderful walks and tasty food
6980747 a thoroughly wonderful week of rest and relaxation as well as many amazing walks the house was cozy and comfortable the children loved the secret attic room and blazing fires
6980748 the scenery is amazing especially after rain when the colours are so vivid we look forward to our next visit
6980749 the cottage is fantastic full of character bags of space and perfectly located also amazingly quiet at night for spain
6980750 the roof terrace is absolutely wonderful i spent my days just sitting reading a book watching the swallows diving all round then sipping gin and tonics as the sun went down i shall certainly be returning
6980751 in the ensuing gunbattle 15 militants were killed and one was arrested alive
6980752 with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all
6980753 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6980754 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6980755 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6980756 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6980757 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6980758 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
6980759 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them
6980760 we hope the rebels are reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
6980761 while there has been resistance the groups there have been running around because wherever they withdraw they bump into some of our battalions
6980762 can set off a chain of reprisals and only increase the danger facing civilians
6980763 un fin il cito cual es ensalzar las personas de los presos integrantes de la organizaci n terrorista eta y en concreto justificar o amparar los hechos por ellos cometidos
6980764 sin que ni el ayuntamiento la ertzaintza ni el gobierno vasco realicen el m s m nimo esfuerzo por evitarlo
6980765 celebrar a las personas privadas de libertad relacionadas con la organizaci n terrorista eta y en tal sentido los actos por ellas cometidos
6980766 quiere seguir apoder ndose de la educaci n en m xico por eso estamos como estamos
6980767 enrique c r bsamen unas 300 personas se apostaron all para protestar por la pol tica que ha empleado elba esther gordillo al proponer la desaparici n de las escuelas normales e instaurar escuelas tecnol gicas situaci n que los normalistas consideraron inadecuado e inoportuno
6980768 no entendemos el porqu del servilismo de la maestra gordillo quitar las normales privatizar la educaci n y ponerse al servicio del gobierno generar a muchas cosas en contra de los mexicanos
6980769 este a o aparentemente se ofertan 25 mil espacios cuando antes eran 75 mil las plazas por las que se concursaban eso quiere decir que no se han respetado los acuerdos porque uno de los beneficios que tienen los sindicatos son precisamente la entrega de plazas
6980770 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6980771 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6980772 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6980773 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6980774 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can

6981139 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate

6981149 our officers need to be particularly aware of the challenges facing people who have an autism spectrum disorder so that any difficulties in communication are not misinterpreted
6981150 carrying a card will make people aware that they have the condition and the training that we are providing to north yorkshire police should help officers to know how to deal with someone who has the condition reduce their anxiety and prevent the situation getting out of control we hope other police authorities will follow suit
6981151 it is a mystery as to why all three should be targeted and on the same night we are a bit puzzled as to the motive behind the incidents especially as nothing seems to have been taken
6981152 i think it probably would have happened between midnight and 9am which would not have been the busiest time but there might have been someone walking their dog who might have seen something or someone may have overheard whoever was responsible talking about it
6981153 when i heard about the break in i was sure they would have taken the plasma tv or the spirits you expect things to have gone but when i got there i thought hang on nothing has moved

6981158 the original investigation into this death resulted in a report being prepared for the coroner
6981159 the recent publicity has generated a number of calls from members of the public as a result of which new information has come to light
6981160 we are now looking at this and as with any information received from members of the community we consider it and take an appropriate course of action
6981161 we are grateful to the people who have contacted us so far and urge anyone who may have relevant information to contact us
6981162 we will be working closely with the coroner on this
6981163 whether he is a prime suspect or not i am not really sure at this stage
6981164 there may well be a perfectly innocent explanation for the lodger disappearing but what we want to do is speak to this individual because he may be able to tell us about the last movements of the victims
6981165 we are currently going through the bank accounts and financial state of things
6981166 we do not think these people were making a huge amount of money out of whatever has been taking place

6981168 we want to find out whether the two victims figured in the chain of command

6981216 for banks that want to get their hands on cash its a lot easier to pay up on consumer deposits than to tap the credit markets
6981217 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6981218 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6981219 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6981220 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6981221 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6981222 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6981223 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6981224 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6981225 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6981226 it is still necessary that as civil society we intervene to ensure that ghana gets the best deal in the process
6981227 the interim epa is fraudulent because it goes beyond what it claims to do instead of focusing on trade in goods the agreement actually captures the singapore issues such as procurement trade related issues and intellectual property rights
6981228 more importantly from the point of view of genuine development the lepas are also a framework for expansion into full and comprehensive epas which include commitments that have been rejected and thrown out of the wto such as universal liberalization and deregulation of services and investment rules
6981229 equally such clarification will facilitate linkages and mobilization of strategic constituencies and help sustain the upscaling of the stop epa campaign and its broad range of advocacy and campaign intervention outside and inside the official negotiations
6981230 the said report also cited dr nduom for illegal receipts of per diem payments from sec totaling 41 261 having improperly held himself out as a foreign consultant and at the same time when he was concurrently a consultant at various companies
6981231 the cpp is currently in a state of anxiety over the fate of dr nduom a situation which has been aggravated by the disclosure of the sfos acting executive secretary in a letter dated february 7 2001 to the appointments committee of parliament to the effect that the sec case can still be said to be pending the findings notwithstanding
6981232 i said to my partner one thing were lucky about is that weve done so many stadium shows
6981233 well rehearse a little and then show up thursday and hope to do it
6981234 i have my team with me i know what were getting into its not easy but at the end of the day its going to be one of the most historic things ever and how can you not want to be a part of it
6981235 every time you do one of these you try to do something technologically advanced that people havent seen before
6981236 their budget was a lot more than ours and they had a lot more free labor
6981237 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6981238 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6981239 bastion of bigotry against men that has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program
6981240 the courses pretty much treat guys as if theyre sources of evil in the world and the women are victims
6981241 im using the same argument here as we have with title ix when a university receives government funding they have to provide equal opportunities for men and women if theres no mens studies womens studies is unconstitutional
6981242 if roy den hollander really understood what mens studies was
6981243 but whenever you make a charge that youre favoring one group over the other they either have to make it equal or eliminate the first one id like to see every womens studies program throughout the country eliminated
6981244 its a belief system and like all religions its an irrational one
6981245 a feminist is someone who was born as a female and because of that believes theyre superior to men and that females are innocent until proven guilty and that guys are primarily always at fault
6981246 im willing to take a chance on him im willing to give him the benefit of the doubt
6981247 nikitas what do you suggest happened sometimes when one is far away one can see clearer
6981248 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings the idea of sailing to gaza is kind of crazy but its also very straight forward the whole idea of having just one palestinian whos been forced off their land and who is able to return to palestine this is something that could demolish the whole zionist venture and it just has to be one person if one person can do it then others can do it this project this boat is about giving people the freedom to take responsibility you shouldnt expect something from others if you cant do it yourself and this is true both on a very personal but also on a political level
6981249 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies
6981250 im 64 years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
6981251 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do but i realized that we can change things in small ways and we have a responsibility to do this
6981252 you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
6981253 israel is all the time looking for any excuse to close the gates to gaza
6981254 what is coming into gaza in terms of goods and materials that can reduce unemployment and improve the economy is not acceptable
6981255 hamas stalled the prisoner negotiations because it sees that israel is not fulfilling its obligations under the ceasefire
6981256 until israel sticks to the terms of the agreement hamas is not going to address the issue of gilad shalit
6981257 hamas has found itself in a situation especially after israel decided to release prisoners to fatah hizbollah had an achievement and fatah had an achievement
6981258 hamas has not ended the rocket bombardment which continues from time to time and did not take steps to bring negotiations over shalit to completion so i think hamas is playing with the cards because it did not get anything other than that in gaza people are living without israeli military presence
6981259 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
6981260 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
6981261 i go in once a day and pray for him
6981262 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
6981263 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him
6981264 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6981265 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
6981266 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
6981267 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
6981268 tidak ingin menjadi teman separtai kaum sosialis yang kebanyakan masih mau berkompromi dengan kapitalis imperialis itu

6981271 i think the legislature passed this law with good intentions and hoped they would help the taxpayers
6981272 for rural schools and communities that are not in an incorporated city it has been a bit of a nightmare
6981273 this is a trend that weve actually been working toward over the last few election cycles
6981274 were trying to decrease the number of election dates its hard to get people out to vote we think that by getting as many elections as possible on the same day we can get more people involved in the process
6981275 before we know the results of the election we have to gather results from two different counties and compile them together to decide whos won
6981276 we need to help make sure there are enough voting machines
6981277 its not fair to require counties cities and school districts to use those and then not help them provide the machines
6981278 its quite harmful because it takes board members and the superintendent a while to gain knowledge
6981279 its possible that only three board members could have any experience
6981280 the goal is to make voting easier and we are open to ways to improve the process
6981281 di bawah pimpinan tan dan sudirman para pemuda itu menyerang pos dan kubu pertahanan jepang

6981307 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name
6981308 i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6981309 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen
6981310 she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
6981311 i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6981312 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6981313 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna
6981314 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6981315 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit
6981316 we had a chance to win at the game at the end
6981317 they fought for four quarters and thats all you can ask
6981318 we have a great secondary our linebackers played awesome on our d line we have some big bodies up there i knew we were going to have to score offensively i wasnt worried about our defense

6981337 its been in the pipeline for years and hundreds have put a lot of work into planning and designing the project
6981338 its a needy vital project and it should be a top priority it was but then police and courts went from no 10 to no 1 and the senior center went the other direction id like to see it back in its proper place so the public works committee can go forward in fundraising for it
6981339 i dont know what the final result of all this will be
6981340 but i think the more it is debated and discussed and not decided behind closed doors the better off we are
6981341 we just want a fair hearing and to get it in front of the voters
6981342 this is the fourth time the council has voted 7 0 on it so ill just be happy when its approved and put on the ballot to let the voters decide
6981343 we had to lobby very hard and kept up a presence at the meetings to let the council know how we felt
6981344 it seems like the council has been going one way and the administration another way
6981345 its been frustrating the city is having a rough patch right now
6981346 but its my experience that government should accommodate the goals and wishes of the public let them tell you what they want
6981347 but what is debatable is to what level do we improve them
6981348 because the expenditure has to meet the citys needs and what we are able to pay
6981349 its clear what our needs are there theyre pretty basic
6981350 they havent changed we are providing a basic service and we shouldnt be working in a storage unit
6981351 we need a courtroom and a jury room and all the other basic things to do our job
6981352 the council should come ask the court people who work here to find out the conditions we deal with every day
6981353 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy later in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6981354 ive now answered questions incorrectly so many times that ill definitely know the right answer when i see it this time
6981355 general fund replacement for city prefunding of various capital projects
6981356 failure to operate their nursing homes in conformity with their representations and advertisements
6981357 what we are looking for is not personal injury compensation but accountability and responsibility
6981358 but based on our research into their extended care facilities we feel in our opinion there is a consistent pattern here
6981359 you wouldnt leave a car accident rolling down the highway
6981360 there are just more and more old boats in puget sound that are of zero value and i think that will just spur more of this sort of thing
6981361 you have to make some choices that can certainly add stress to an already stressful life
6981362 trying to put all the basic elements of living together and finding you dont have enough at the end of the week much less at the end of the month
6981363 i believe that they want to help other families have that same positive experience that good send off to a really fun adventure at school
6981364 especially because i was campaigning in six counties and my job was already pretty much 24 7
6981365 i should have been doing something with my spare time other than sitting in a sorority not furthering any part of my life
6981366 i would have class for about three hours a day and after that nothing the boredom got to me and i began to realize that i really was not used to all this down time
6981367 since fourth grade i have had at least two practices and one game per week and then in high school i was playing sports all year round
6981368 my grades began to slip at uw because i wasnt occupying my time like i was used to it used to be sports practice and then homework and there wasnt time for much else
6981369 it only seemed like disneyland for a girl who loved basketball i fell in love with the school more and more each year we went there
6981370 the campus was beautiful and for some reason it all inspired me to push myself and do well academically and try out as a walk on for soccer
6981371 i have a new outlook on who i am and what i do now because i am doing something i actually want to do i never wanted to go to uw and that showed
6981372 this part was the toughest because its the part where the coach gets to see how badly you want something
6981373 coach shannon told me it was too late but i could try if i wanted to i let that get to me for a day and then i decided that she was just testing me to see if i could actually do it and if i wanted it
6981374 it was stressful with a job working 40 hours a week and having minimal time to train but its all i ever wanted
6981375 its a huge switch from playing kick ball to playing possession
6981376 mentally i knew that the style of play was going to be more focused on possession and passing but physically i had never played at this intense of a level it was hard to get used to for the first day but i caught on quickly
6981377 although i have not played in a game yet i am still nervous for that
6981378 i am as happy as ever that i followed through with this
6981379 most athletes are handed their opportunity i had to work for mine and train at 9 p m every night after work and endure some challenges at the same time to get where i am today
6981380 if i could give any advice to youngins out there i would say that anything is possible if you put your mind to it
6981381 dont stop playing sports just because no college program saw you in high school there is always one out there
6981382 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
6981383 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6981384 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
6981385 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
6981386 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
6981387 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
6981388 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
6981389 its definitely bittersweet i am going to miss all my customers
6981390 but the lease was too high for me and the lease is too high for the business its definitely a business decision
6981391 most everything is gone already a lot of people are buying it up to move into other restaurants
6981392 it was a real labor of love when we first put that place together
6981393 but you know its time for a change i feel like its probably the right thing to happen
6981394 ill be somewhere in the restaurant business but not owning one in the near future
6981395 ill probably be working in seattle so to begin working elsewhere i need to be done with the cafe after this weekend
6981396 i heard rumors and then about midway through july i heard we were closing for sure
6981397 i think its pretty sad i really liked that restaurant and i loved that job i know one of the waitresses got a job at san carlos and one of the cooks got a job at richies so i think the ex staff are doing alright on finding new jobs
6981398 its always a tragedy anytime an icon business like the winslow way cafe goes out of business
6981399 it was a place people gravitated to a little later in the evening it was popular for cocktails and social gatherings that was one of its strong suits
6981400 due to unreachable expectations we are not choosing to renew our lease in this space we regret that we will be closing the winslow way as we know it on august 18th
6981401 so when i got my chance i made the best of it
6981402 my brother had gotten injured and i told the coaches to put me back there
6981403 i took the first punt i saw back for a touchdown
6981404 when i got here all i heard was about the other receivers
6981405 so in my mind i was thinking i would redshirt but i knew i wanted to play so when they asked freshmen who wanted to be on special teams i went out there the coaches said special teams win games and i was going to try to help my team as much as i could
6981406 to make a good return you have to go out with no fear in your heart
6981407 you have to trust your teammates to get their blocks and then you do what you do
6981408 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
6981409 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6981410 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
6981411 innocently martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
6981412 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations

6981415 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6981416 i want to make that team i think i could help that team i think i would be a good addition but its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too
6981417 76 orang semuanya warga sipil dan kebanyakan dari mereka wanita dan anak anak menjadi martir saat operasi pasukan koalisi di provinsi herat distrik shindand

6981420 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6981421 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6981422 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6981423 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6981424 it was just sort of like bang bang bang bang bang bang and i said to the gentleman who owned the business i was standing in is that gunfire he stuck his head out the door and somebody screamed at us from across the street get back inside so we got back inside
6981425 members and associates of gangs are now arming themselves with firearms
6981426 it is becoming evident that the war on drugs is not only affecting gang members but also members of the general public who are innocent bystanders
6981427 theres no indication he wont co operate its just that his condition right now is such that medically he is not in a condition to say much
6981428 just by chance i was a block away so i wasnt in danger
6981429 on the one hand you want to inform the public of whats going on
6981430 on the other hand you dont want the public to be unduly fearful of the city so its a double edged sword
6981431 we pulled the coastal renaissance vessel that provides service between nanaimo and vancouver from service on two occasions
6981432 that was aug 5 and 6 we had an electrical problem aug 13 and 14 we pulled renaissance again we had a leaking seal that was a warranty issue so we had that dry docked
6981433 certainly it was unfortunate with that fire but that had nothing to do with b c ferries
6981434 normally on a friday on a summer on this route well see probably about 15 000 people departing each terminal about 30 000 people travelling the route
6981435 its wonderful to see us hiring more talent like matt
6981436 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6981437 theres no political involvement at all with regard to how canada will be presented to the world other than our desire to see vanoc the vancouver olympic organizing committee succeed in presenting the 2010 games and canada to the world
6981438 a great ceremony that will take canada out to the world is going to be the result of collaboration and co operation and input from many many different places
6981439 on behalf of canadian taxpayers we want to make sure that federal dollars are spent in a way thatll promote the 2010 games and promote successful opening ceremonies
6981440 also were hopeful that the 2010 olympic committee will present a fantastic show to canadians and the world and opening ceremonies that will reflect canadas multicultural reality our bicultural history and our official language communities across the country and thats what were hopeful for in terms of getting a return for our investment
6981441 keep in mind this is a memo from one bureaucrat to another
6981442 it had nothing to do with myself or other ministers or the government this is a conversation between two bureaucrats and thats fine
6981443 but our goals internationally and domestically again are to present fantastic opening ceremonies that reflect canadas cultural past our cultural present and promotes canada as the greatest place in the world to live
6981444 this is a disease that we normally see but we dont see it in these numbers in july the number got much higher than our usual baseline
6981445 we have been in an outbreak situation in nanaimo since the middle of july
6981446 we have instituted multiple infection control practices over and above our normal infection control practices
6981447 it takes several weeks to get that type of testing because its genetic molecular testing
6981448 when this woman was buried back in the 1980s dna wasnt even an option as a means of identification
6981449 we have exhumed bodies of cold cases in the past its not unusual
6981450 we would want to develop a dna profile in the event that a missing persons profile or their familial profile was available for comparison
6981451 twenty two years ago we may not have reached out and exposed this story to a lot of people that may not have been privy to the internet
6981452 certain information coming to our attention as a result of the investigation of the former chief of police
6981453 once we become aware there might be a serious problem we have an obligation to inform the law society
6981454 raised enough concerns that we felt we should report it
6981455 thats more than i had anticipated and its a nice contribution to the community
6981456 this is simply not the place to hold such an event
6981457 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6981458 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6981459 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
6981460 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
6981461 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
6981462 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity
6981463 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
6981464 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
6981465 universities are social institutions with a responsibility to the public we serve
6981466 improving the quality of k 12 education enhancing public health and ensuring sustainable development the public expects our universities to improve quality of life for individuals and communities
6981467 determine areas in which we can be best is the world uncg has an unparalleled opportunity to build a metropolitan research university based on a new model one that is grounded in our commitment to students and our passion for improving quality of life we must define our competitive advantage and pursue it this means we must make strategic choices because we cannot do everything and be excellent in all that we do
6981468 through new eyes and with new appreciation as this newcomer sees them
6981469 its great its one area the city can save money and conserve resources and reduce pollution
6981470 i think its a bad idea in a way because youd have more people running around drunk
6981471 when people are 18 theyre old enough to move to college and live by themselves so why arent they able to drink
6981472 i know the emotional response of youre old enough to fight in the war but you cant buy beer and thats a point thats difficult to reject
6981473 but alcohol has an effect on some people that maturity alone can manage
6981474 theres evidence out there that indicates that younger persons that are drinking are prone to many injuries and accidents and that drinking leads to behavioral issues
6981475 on a college campus it could also lead to poor performance academically
6981476 id like to see some more data about the law and what the consequences are of what we do
6981477 i would not be in favor of lowering the age without some kind of education along the way i dont think young people understand what the consequences of excessive drinking are
6981478 thats our tradition to discern to talk to have meetings
6981479 arent necessarily wired to tell them when enough alcohol is enough
6981480 the evidence is pretty clear that the earlier you start using alcohol the greater the possibility of your developing problems from alcohol later on
6981481 were considered adults at 18 and we have to take on the responsibilities of an adult
6981482 i would need to see some studies i would need to see some surveys i would need to see some substantive and substantial research that would answer that and i dont think sufficient research has been done in that area
6981483 do not let anyone think less of you because you are young be an example to all believers in what you teach in the way you live in your love your faith and your purity
6981484 it told me that they dont believe all the damage was caused by the construction even though all these buildings were fine before they started
6981485 well either write them a check and they get it repaired or our contractor can make the repairs
6981486 but its been six months since the loop opened and it hits me every time i go out in the yard
6981487 we can hear the road in our beds at night especially when the 18 wheelers do that decompression thing they do
6981488 as far as i know nobody has heard a word about the committee
6981489 but its the only way i can keep these people happy
6981490 if i had known then what i know now i never would have bought into this development
6981491 right now im a member of the homeowners association in good standing
6981492 she said well youre supposed to be saving these old houses not tearing them down
6981493 and i said wait a minute we try we try all the time to put ourselves out of business but we cant save every house what would you rather us do stand there and watch the bulldozers come because they are coming with all
6981494 and she said well i never thought of it that way so sometimes we have to educate people
6981495 thats been one of our themes all along lets not send it to the landfill and if you need stuff for an old house the only way to get it may be off of another old house
6981496 people who buy architectural salvage have an appreciation for old building materials the quality the craftsmanship
6981497 because lets face it anyone can go to a big box building supplies store and buy a door or a faucet for less money people are buying architectural antiques because of the history the authenticity and the quality and craftsmanship that went into it
6981498 usually folks like to have the distressed paint as it is
6981499 on some that i have ive actually left the window frames outside for a year so that the paint would peel i then put polyurethane over it because i didnt want any more paint to come off especially in the house and it makes a nice old feature
6981500 but sometimes ill come in like on a wednesday check the messages and there will be someone saying we have a house thats going to be bulldozed monday and so we have to scramble to get a team together for saturday and usually we have anywhere from four to 15 people show up from doctors and accountants to engineers and some contractor type folks
6981501 usually our time is limited so we have to prioritize what were going to go for flooring is one of those items that we have a high demand for
6981502 theres also a demand for the older type glass that has a wavy pattern and there are numerous types of unique sinks weve taken out and certainly a lot of unique lighting fixtures
6981503 they chopped a hole put someone on the rafters and carefully broke the plaster from around it
6981504 student government is thrilled that the university will offer this new option allowing students the opportunity to easily move around miami and see everything that it has to offer
6981505 students can travel off campus to attend interviews run errands or take a weekend trip and they dont have to spend money on the upkeep of their own car
6981506 the partnership with zipcar continues ums commitment to invest in sustainable solutions on campus and gives students faculty and staff an environmentally friendly way of getting around
6981507 while the overall numbers are down slightly from last year it is important to note that more michigan residents are spending their vacation dollars in michigan
6981508 lower gas prices may help invigorate travel during the waning days of the summer travel season labor day is also a good time for last minute cruise and tour specials
6981509 we currently have two homes available to move in and three others under construction
6981510 we want the community to be pedestrian friendly so everybody gets to know their neighbors
6981511 these villas are very well suited for people who are tired of maintaining their lawn
6981512 its more like having an individual home because the only adjoining wall is that garage
6981513 we wilden far cry 2 op basis van onze eigen technologie ontwikkelen en wisten dus dat we een geheel nieuwe engine moesten maken het is veel moeilijker om een engine van de grond af aan op te bouwen dan om met een bestaande engine te starten en daar gaandeweg onderdelen van te vervangen het is wel mogelijk maar dan zouden we vanaf het begin tegelijkertijd belangrijke onderdelen als physics en rendering moeten programmeren vandaar dat we de cryengine van far cry hebben gebruikt als basis dat gaf ons de mogelijkheid om ons steeds volledig te concentreren op n onderdeel en stuk voor stuk delen van de engine te vervangen we zijn overigens niet over n nacht ijs gegaan in april 2005 zijn we aan het project begonnen en we hebben eerst het nodige onderzoek gedaan we wilden weten wat de mogelijkheden van de cryengine zijn wat we wilden bereiken met de dunia engine en waar de concurrentie mee bezig was we wilden vooraf vooral duidelijk hebben hoe we de dag en nachtcyclus aan zouden pakken en hoe we dynamische belichting in zouden bouwen we hebben ook goed nagedacht over de bomen en vegetatie in het spel
6981514 ons onderzoek heeft tot het eind van 2005 geduurd en daarna zijn we gaan programmeren we hebben tot begin 2007 besteed aan pre productie dus aan het ombouwen van de engine begin 2007 waren we zover dat de rest van het team met de engine kon gaan werken we waren absoluut nog niet klaar met ons werk maar de editors waar de rest van het team het spel mee moet maken waren klaar dus toen zijn we met de echte productie van de game begonnen we begonnen alle textures modellen en animaties te ontwikkelen en gingen de eerste delen van de spelwereld bouwen
6981515 the use of government vehicles with official markings especially those associated with friendly military government and public safety entities could be a means of delivering a vehicle borne explosive device to a target site this method could allow terrorists to bypass established security protocols and strike hardened high value targets
6981516 load it with a conventional explosive or even a radiological device and you have the makings of a truly ultimate nightmare scenario
6981517 that is law enforcement sensitive the lawyers are looking at that now
6981518 during the investigation a second stolen truck again with fema markings and other fema documentation was also recovered
6981519 i thought today he won more impressively than he has been
6981520 he shot out today and danny came across on lucky secret
6981521 hes an aggressive going horse so when something sits right up outside him even though hes got better hes still quite aggressive and then hes a query in this sort of class
6981522 they left us alone and thats why i got rolling at the 500 metres to try to get a few of them off the bridle on this track
6981523 he didnt handle the track a hundred percent so i was really pleased with him
6981524 it was probably his easiest win in terms of he had it pretty easy early
6981525 hes been carrying big weights and hes not a huge horse but hes very wide so he carries weight no problems
6981526 he hasnt got a lot more to prove at 1000 metres and hes got to have a crack at a group 1 race like that
6981527 im a big question mark on whether hed run the trip out specially in a high pressure manikato
6981528 it would be a pretty hard race to win but its worth having a try at
6981529 if he gets away with a nice sort of run even outside the leader hes got a good chance
6981530 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6981531 we will have to see what other issues were present
6981532 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the manoeuvre and have it reviewed
6981533 these have been an absolutely fantastic games and theres no doubt that in terms of performance and theatre the chinese have set the bar pretty high
6981534 but i think with british ingenuity wit and all the rest of it resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6981535 i am absolutely determined that we come in under the 9 3 billion i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6981536 we are looking at ways of economising find ways of moving things around perhaps but in no way do i want to prejudice the legacy value of the olympics
6981537 evidemment la question la plus importante est est ce que la personne num ro deux sur le
6981538 je veux quelquun qui soit capable de mettre mes id es l preuve et qui ne soit pas un simple b ni oui oui
6981539 le retrait des unit s militaires russes sest d roul sans incident et a t achev conform ment aux plans vers 19h50 heure de moscou 15h50 gmt

6981544 very determined and talented band performing with palpable joy and intense respect for one another demonstrating the power of simplicity and organic melodies
6981545 each student in the class opened his book to the page specified
6981546 of course the men drew the picture as a male only class
6981547 thats what it literally said they were just understanding it more literally then the women
6981548 do unto others as youd have them do unto you
6981549 a blind journalist was given a months suspended jail sentence and fined 500 by a french court friday for driving while drunk and without a license
6981550 if there is this perception out there that c sections are somehow safer or better we wanted to point out thats not completely the case
6981551 it has more risk of bleeding more risk of infection and scarring that can affect future pregnancy or the health of the mother in general
6981552 aku ini cup cup agyl jangan nangis dong ini walkie talkienya eh noleh ke sini dong mau di foto kenapa ya
6981553 ow itu kamu habis banting walkie talkie nangis gara gara belum difoto sambil megang walkie talkie
6981554 i lost a bit of my concentration in the second set i dont know why
6981555 ive just recovered from a cold ive played a lot of matches these last couple of weeks tonight im paying for it
6981556 ive rekindled the fire ive found a great feel around the court im really on the right track
6981557 ive known caroline since i was eleven i knew that you have to be 100 percent in order to beat her it was just not the case today
6981558 i feel really confident its been a really good month for me
6981559 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didnt happen
6981560 we have sent the information to our facilitator two days ago but no response to date
6981561 once again amy weaves a suspenseful tale of intrigue that will leave you begging for more healing promises is heart wrenching and powerful the chase to stop a killer kept me turning the pages and clint and saras story broke my heart and kept me cheering for them right to the last page whether you want an emotional story straight from the heart or a suspense full of twists and turns healing promises delivers it all
6981562 in healing promises amy wallace does what so few writers are willing to do she looks down the gun barrel of reality and she does it without flinching this novel was so real it nearly breathes on its own i highly recommend it
6981563 the l ord gave and the l ord hath taken away blessed be the name of the l ord
6981564 it was an offer that we think was good and just
6981565 i think that the less traditional approach to the fair will encourage more people to participate
6981566 some people might be intimidated by strict rules and categories of typical county and state fairs
6981567 this year we will have a wide range of fair activities including demonstrations of pioneering skills by the churchill county museum art contests and even cooking demonstrations there should be something for everyone
6981568 during the next few weeks the festival committee will continue to inform the public of all of these activities
6981569 if we continue to spend year after year we may look like our neighbor to the west
6981570 but not one stood up and said we should raise taxes
6981571 i predict nevadas going to be a shining beacon for businesses to spend their money in places other than california
6981572 its not a tax problem if it was then california would have taxed its way out
6981573 its a spending problem the only way we can control this issue is to deal with spending
6981574 i will support lands bills when the locals support them
6981575 intrucat varstele gimnastelor prezentate in pasaport sunt puse sub semnul intrebarii am solicitat asociatiei chineze de gimnastica alte documente care sa ateste data de nastere a acestora
6981576 parintii gimnastelor sunt extrem de indignati ei se intraba de ce copii lor sunt suspectati in aceeasi competitie gimnastele japoneze erau la fel de mici ca si chinezoaicele europenii si americanii sunt mai robusti in timp ce noi suntem ca popor de talie mai mica
6981577 eu sunt nascuta in 1972 dar in pasaportul federatiei apaream cu anul de nastere 1970 aveam 13 ani atunci cand mi a fost modificata varsta se retrasesera multe dintre gimnastele care participasera la los angeles si nu exista echipa pentru europene cine ma intreba pe mine atunci daca sunt de acord sau nu stiam insa ca se va afla candva
6981578 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6981579 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6981580 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6981581 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6981582 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6981583 yea they beat the hell out of us turned out a pregnant woman almost lost her baby because of us
6981584 i have taken up the issue with the ministry of finance on the way forward in order to reduce taxation on local cotton and encourage more farmers to venture into it
6981585 it is the responsibility of the government to support cotton farmers who are mainly from marginal areas
6981586 we have to support these farmers to grow market and establish an environment for a reliable price for their cotton
6981587 i project that we might agree on sh30 per kilo which is a considerable figure
6981588 for instance our spinach sells at sh35 a kilo while the conventional one sells at sh15
6981589 i read somewhere that organic foods have extra properties that protect one against cancer hypertension and other diseases
6981590 in any case any girl who is somebody in town is eating organics
6981591 no systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs
6981592 the produce in this study was analysed as dry matter whereas most people will consume fruits and vegetables fresh
6981593 it is common knowledge that important nutrients are lost during processing
6981594 ich denke nur gerade ber den sinn meines lebens nach
6981595 da m ssen wir hans fragen der wei sicher einen sinn f r dein leben
6981596 ich bewache unser haus schon so lang und noch niemals ist einer aufgetaucht ich wei doch nicht einmal wie einer aussieht

6981598 und bei der polizei haben sie so viele davon dass sie hunde brauchen um sie alle fangen zu k nnen
6981599 leider werden sich unsere wege nun trennen ich gehe zur polizei
6981600 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily reintegrate themselves back into society
6981601 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
6981602 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6981603 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6981604 there is a sense of normalcy thats returning to iraq
6981605 would not have been possible just a couple of months ago
6981606 what impressed obama about biden is that biden gets things done hes a man of action hes not a bullshitter
6981607 demi merealisasikan target meraup dua juta kaum muda amerika kami perlu menjangkau wilayah di mana mereka berada tak ada keraguan bahwa banyak dari mereka menggandrungi xbox dan xbox live
6981608 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make and what was the process you used to make it
6981609 i was firmly convinced at the time that we did not have strong evidence of weapons of mass destruction
6981610 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
6981611 american express will not suspend state billing accounts at the normal past due interval however we reserve the right to suspend service should the impasse become protracted
6981612 some staff are choosing to absorb the costs and seek reimbursement later
6981613 a budget impasse imposes american express with a financial liability
6981614 during our long term partnership we have found ourselves supporting transactions that cannot be paid by the state and supporting state travelers who cannot be reimbursed for travel expenses
6981615 amex is demonstrating to us that they want to work with us by agreeing to carry balances without penalty until a budget is signed
6981616 what they arent willing to do is carry balances that are holdovers from the last fiscal year that should have been taken care of by employees already
6981617 rock amp a hard place another night at the agora
6981618 o baby i take off my cloak and wizard hat
6981619 the bottom line is we cant really edit out the offending scenes
6981620 it turns out there are four or five of them and to take them out would screw up the movie entirely
6981621 to create controversy to make political statements or to be on the avant garde of the movie world let alone to offend significant members of our community
6981622 there are plenty of other forums for people to get into political or artistic discussions
6981623 but thats not what this is about were trying to find entertainment that reaches across all ages and backgrounds
6981624 obviously we missed the mark with our choice of breakfast at tiffanys
6981625 i wasnt going to make everybody happy editing out the scenes and im never going to make everybody happy
6981626 lets have a fun relaxing evening and not get embroiled in controversy
6981627 belum kita belum keluarkan izin kunjungan bagi keluarga amrozi dan kawan kawan
6981628 saya belum mendapat informasi tetapi saya kaget dengan adanya kabar kalau amrozi dkk akan segera dieksekusi padahal bulan puasa tinggal beberapa hari lagi
6981629 padahal kerajaan ini banyak disebut pada amukti palapa dalam hikayat pararaton sejarah melayu dalam laporan mendez pinto penguasa portugis di malaka laporan admiral cheng zhe cheng ho maupun pengembara dari negeri china lainnya
6981630 hipotesa bahwa kota rentang adalah pusat kerajaan aru banyak didukung oleh faktor seperti jalur dari karo plateau maupun hinterland menuju pantai timur yang terfokus pada sei wampu dan muara deli di kawasan itu juga ditemukan ragam keramik yang berasal dari china muangthai srilangka serta koin atau mata uang arab dari abad ke 13 hingga 14
6981631 kita menemukan bukti bukti yang meyakinkan untuk lebih memperjelas gambaran tentang apa yang berlangsung di wilayah itu pada masa lampau
6981632 dari hasil penelitian ini diduga tinggalan arkeologi yang ditemukan memiliki persamaan dengan situs lainnya yang terletak dalam satu jaringan pesisir pedalaman antara lain kota cina
6981633 trying to act as the grown up in the budget negotiations
6981634 the problem with using that kind of bullying language is that hes tried it in the past and it didnt work
6981635 i dont believe it shows strong backbone to have said no tax increases publicly for years and years and years and then to change your position overnight
6981636 these are all people that admire our great men and women who go to iraq and afghanistan look at what they risk they risk their lives thats heroic to be afraid of what the consequences are in budget votes i mean thats quite the opposite
6981637 nobody likes tax increases least of all the hard working taxpayers and the business men and women who pay them
6981638 however this budget this year is about more than tax increases
6981639 the governors framework may provide a unique opportunity to achieve flexible work days to guarantee a mandatory budget reserve to limit the growth of government and to permanently reduce the states tax rate
6981640 it was just my way of saying look i go and am willing to compromise and go beyond what i have said i will do and why dont you do the same thing
6981641 i try to let republicans know that its ok to go and do a tax increase that the state isnt going to come to an end
6981642 his point is you never make real change unless some people take a risk and hes right
6981643 but i dont think that calling us out hes frustrated lets face it
6981644 this poem is from a correctional facility this is a pre paid poem you will not be charged for this poem this poems checking up on his aunt carol this poems father is long gone this poems mothers grown indifferent to the what goes on this poem needs bail money this poem wants to come home

6981657 some studies have even shown the acid producing potential of these types of foods is equal to what the mouth produces in response to obviously sugary solutions like a cookie or hot chocolate

6981760 bastion of bigotry against men that has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program
6981761 the courses pretty much treat guys as if theyre sources of evil in the world and the women are victims
6981762 im using the same argument here as we have with title ix when a university receives government funding they have to provide equal opportunities for men and women if theres no mens studies womens studies is unconstitutional
6981763 if roy den hollander really understood what mens studies was
6981764 but whenever you make a charge that youre favoring one group over the other they either have to make it equal or eliminate the first one id like to see every womens studies program throughout the country eliminated

6981814 they pulled down ski masks gave themselves a look in the window gave each other a non verbal cue and entered the store
6981815 i had a million things going through my head that perhaps they were being robbed or perhaps this has something to do with the gang situation i dont think its that far fetched given the current state of affairs
6981816 at that point i got pretty upset and i said a joke
6981817 the prank was disgusting but how it was handled is more disgusting i think
6981818 what if they went in there and there were customers and one had a gun and saw a robbery in progress and blew the kids head off theres so many things that could have gone wrong
6981819 had they ruins phoned in reporting a robbery yes thered be a charge
6981820 but because its an independent witness who sees it its going to be assumption but obviously it diverts resources from more important files
6981821 common sense should dictate that if you put on a balaclava and walk into a store in downtown prince george its likely going to get called in
6981822 things might be a little bit better looking brighter but not better for all

6981833 that is alot of time bob over two hundred hours per year what this does is expose the truth commission is not really the problem
6981834 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6981835 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6981836 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6981837 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6981838 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6981839 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese

6981843 if you trust every web site but not a government
6981844 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6981845 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6981846 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6981847 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6981848 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including
6981849 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
6981850 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
6981851 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start

6981884 people are doing whatever they need to do to save fuel and for the most part theyre doing a pretty good job of it
6981885 were seeing a lot of people who wouldnt have come back to it if it werent for the gas prices

6981902 is a great kid and hes doing a great job
6981903 on some cars the resale or trade in value is so minimal
6981904 you could be so much more helpful to give it away and you could take a tax deduction
6981905 as long as a car runs and has air conditioning its useful to somebody on foot
6981906 when you combine those two things it means national recognition
6981907 this honor is another indicator of our quality christ centered academic programs particularly the new ranking in engineering

6982083 between a quarter and a third of the people on the section 8 voucher program came off the program each year mainly due to improvement in their economic circumstances
6982084 its lower now than its been in a while were actually probably about 2 5 percent
6982085 weve got at least one person for every unit in inventory on our waiting list
6982086 some of these families that probably could go out in the private sector theyre not going to do that right now
6982087 its been lengthened because the housing authority doesnt have any placements
6982088 well the track i think is good obviously the first day is difficult for everybody to get the braking points especially as it is very hard on brakes you need to find the braking points as soon as you can and then there are some parts that are very similar
6982089 i think going into turn 12 and going to turn 17 the two longest straights are very similar so one time i thought i was in turn 17 and i was in turn 12 and i missed the apex and vice versa this was p1
6982090 in p2 i learned the track a little bit more it is not easy quite challenging and also the last sector is quite nice to drive and you need to really concentrate to get the maximum there we can say that it is not a normal street circuit it is a little bit more than a street circuit
6982091 well as fernando said a new track is a new challenge for everybody especially in first free practice some drivers did prepare a bit more than the others with simulators and stuff like this but anyway it took three or four laps to learn where to go and it is not easy on the braking
6982092 there are three or four very long straights which in the end you have heavy braking so it is a very demanding track in this area i feel i miss some high speed corners in the last sector there are some high speed corners but they are flat out easy so it is a stop and go track which is good for me
6982093 yeah i mean we have seen in hockenheim with the hairpin in corner five that once you have very hard braking after a very long straight there are opportunities to overtake as i think everybody misses overtaking in f1 i think here in valencia we have some opportunities in two places or maybe three also it is quite difficult if you are on the same pace or just a bit quicker if someone doesnt make a mistake
6982094 i walked the track yesterday and i can tell you it is even more challenging than to do it by car especially in the heat of lunchtime i think they did a hell of a job it is very impressive what they have put together here in less than a year
6982095 the track as the drivers said is not a real street circuit it is quite fast you have run off zones as we havent seen them on any street circuit so far i have to say i am really impressed
6982096 the result like robert said is not only the street circuit it is something more than that it is an amazing job really the ambience is fantastic this is another good circuit for formula one with the boats in the harbour the atmosphere it is the right way to see formula one go i am very impressed with the job done by valencia
6982097 there is no engine development as far as i know
6982098 for me it is not development at all it is only a question to have the frozen engine
6982099 like you have seen in the last three months the car has improved and fernando has done an amazing job in the team to motivate everybody
6982100 and if somebody was in difficulty because the reliability was not there i remember at the time mclaren had a problem with that we are sure the federation should put the right arrangement to make sure the engine finishes the race this is what we were talking about
6982101 absolutely i think we started the season not in a perfect way the first three races i think we were just in q3 p9 or p10 in q2 then in barcelona we made a step and then we kept improving the car race after race
6982102 we are in a position always now to be in the top six in qualifying and always in the points in races this is something that at the beginning of the season was impossible for us for sure we are improving we are climbing and this weekend maybe we will see another step forward hopefully
6982103 well it is never nice if you have to look back we are pushing ahead but what i wanted to express is that we have moved resources from this years car to next years car already but we are still developing this years car and we have some developments in the pipeline for the races to come we are still pushing ahead you cannot predict any results so we will see what we can do
6982104 i think i was in a better position after canada in the drivers standings unfortunately we missed some pace in the last three or four races to toyota have improved quite a lot
6982105 in hockenheim my race was screwed by the safety car when i was running p4 which was a very good place for me with good pace but in hungary that pace was a bit less competitive than in the beginning of the season
6982106 in the beginning of the year it was much easier to fight against toyota but you know as mario said the team is working and we will see what will be the result in the next few races
6982107 well definitely we have looked at all the technical data after budapest which was a race to forget for our team and we have identified the reasons for that and certainly did everything to iron them out and i am very confident that we have got on top of that
6982108 i think the pit entry is quite nice quite challenging i think if you look into the details you clearly see who is coming in and who is not coming in because if you want to enter the pit you can brake a few metres later so you can gain something on the braking of course there can be some misunderstanding but anyway you are not allowed to cross the white lines so the rules are pretty clear
6982109 i think as robert said it is maybe from the outside more difficult to look who is going into the pits than on the inside but when a car in front of you goes into the pits you see clearly that he brakes a little bit later and when you go to the pits you brake late also you have to stay on the right part of the white line today one time i was not it was my mistake and if you stay on the right i dont think it is a problem and it is not dangerous or anything like that
6982110 there is no either or we need both we certainly need the traditional circuits like spa which have made formula one what it is now we also need new venues like this place which is a really exciting place
6982111 we see new solutions from the track and also it is very good to be in a place where several hundred thousand people live already so it is much easier to attract the crowd it is easier to accommodate people and certainly valencia is a track which has a great future in my view
6982112 i believe this is the right direction to go with singapore with valencia it is a fantastic show if you see what has happened here in valencia with the boats in the harbour for sure i have a better feeling here than in hockenheim
6982113 nothing at all as i have said many times i think for next year the time to think about it will be the end of the season or in the last part of the championship now i am not talking to anyone and it is not the time i am fully concentrated on the championship and i think it would be a mistake to think about next year so early
6982114 i like tracks like this as there is a lot of heavy braking the braking into the last corner is quite interesting with lateral load you go from the corner to the corner and you have to choose a good line over the kerbs which is quite nice the first braking is quite difficult and also the braking into corner 12 is very good braking
6982115 i like the last sector i think turn 19 turn 20 and the last corner as robert said braking with some lateral g is always exciting and you move a little bit in the seat and the cockpit and it is a feeling that maybe you dont have in any other place
6982116 was the question when will we announce next years driver line up between now and the end of the season
6982117 about the same what is more important is to give a winning car to fernando that is our mission for the future this is what we try to do like every team manager tries to do for their own driver
6982118 it was not a fota meeting but a normal team principals meeting and we discussed the future and financial issues how to keep the sport sustainable for all the teams
6982119 i have grown up in single seaters mainly in the first two years with formula renault in the first year i was driving with an italian team and in the second year i joined the rdd programme which unfortunately was always looking a bit different for the future so i decided to go my own way
6982120 i changed category to formula three and then i worked for a short time with renault on my first test in formula one at barcelona in 2005 which was the prize for winning the world series by renault so i always have good memories
6982121 they should name them after the first driver who crashes in one of the corners
6982122 i am not a big fan of naming the corners because its much more difficult to remember the names its much more difficult to speak with the engineers to describe whats going on in certain corners if you ask me the names of the silverstone corners i dont even know maybe one or two
6982123 now in 2008 we have fans at tests over the winter and we have full grandstands at the two spanish grands prix and two races here in spain so there has been a big change in spain and all the spanish people about formula one i am in the middle of everything so i am very happy
6982124 i believe fernando has taken formula one to spain principally because as he said we know how difficult it was to get television to televise the grand prix in spain spain started learning about formula one with fernando without fernando we would still have 350 spectators as it was before this is fact without fernando there was no formula one in spain thats for sure
6982125 if we get wheelspin in eau rouge it means we will have about 3000 horsepower and we dont have that i think it will easily be flat out and it wont be any different compared to last year with tc traction control
6982126 i think we tend to spin the wheels and to have more problems in the first gear corners in the very slow hairpins and the small chicanes in the rest of the corners there is no difference at all compared to last year i think eau rouge will be fine for everybody and we are all looking forward to coming to spa because i think most of the drivers love that circuit
6982127 i would say there are quite a few challenges as you said before
6982128 you know formula one is a race but its entertainment as well we need it to be more efficient i believe its possible to do the same job with at least sixty percent less than what we spend now and then i agree with mario
6982129 if were talking about new technology to be the pioneer of new technology we need to be sure of safety before introducing the car because we have the responsibility to the driver at the moment were talking about kers
6982130 you know on the one hand we have frozen the engines because we want to have a more economical picture but on the other hand we are developing kers and nobody knows how much it costs us it looks like weve closed the window and weve opened the door its a little bit strange
6982131 kers is something that nobody knows how much it costs us when youre budgeting something in formula one its always fifty percent more or a hundred percent more this time its fantastic because nobody knows much it costs there is no limit
6982132 for me i dont think its the right way to push a small team to spend this kind of money i agreed to develop together any system in formula one formula one should develop kers together im pretty happy because i think this is the right way to go when youre talking about the environment
6982133 but its usually the prototype every time in formula one everybody believes that if they develop a system they have a little advantage but this way the costs are completely uncontrolled i believe all the teams were quite happy to develop kers together
6982134 formula one together all the working groups all the engineers together develop the new system and this is really the only way to control costs because we establish the budget there was the same tender for everybody im not happy to develop any technology when i dont know what the budget is thats for sure
6982135 its difficult to evaluate the tyres because every twenty minutes or half an hour when you were going out for a new stint the car was feeling better the track had picked up more rubber and it becomes quicker and quicker
6982136 probably here with variable grip especially today the difference is much bigger than normally but im expecting tomorrow in qualifying the difference being as always so just a couple of tenths
6982137 you can always be quicker somewhere so i dont believe you can do a perfect lap you can improve a bit everywhere and only afterwards you know if you could have gone a bit quicker in certain places or not but the lap is already gone its a kind of compromise between feelings and experience from free practice
6982138 as robert said i think we need to wait and see tomorrow regarding the tyres because today it was difficult to test anything on the tyres because every time we went onto the track there was better grip than the run before
6982139 this is normal for a street circuit and well keep improving until a point tomorrow in qualifying when there will only be a few tenths between the two tyres and i dont know which one will be quicker
6982140 you have only two opportunities two runs two sets of tyres in q3 on the first one you try to get a feeling where to brake and what the grip level is with that amount of fuel and then on the second lap you try to push but there are always difficulties to get the perfect lap but most of the problems on this track with these characteristics will be on braking braking stability going into the corner with some confidence on the brakes will be quite good in terms of a timed lap
6982141 we sent the report to the fia on tuesday i think so before this weekend in parallel we issued a press release yesterday in which we tried to explain it in common terms it is really complicated and very technical
6982142 we have fully understood the jerez incident and on top of that in the course of the analysis we did we have found a lot of other issues which we have put together as a sort of design recommendation for high voltage system this is included in the report we gave to the fia
6982143 and on top of that we have announced that we will do a presentation to the other teams at the next technical working group in the first week of september in order to make all the safety relevant information available to everybody
6982144 i think its very difficult to understand why we need a thousand people to run two cars
6982145 i think we have all generations of press media iq but they always ask the same questions

6982220 generally the vast majority of our schools are safe but clearly there are some where we have more safety challenges and that is where we are targeting intervention
6982221 while the district is moving in the wrong direction we are heartened that some of the schools where we have provided targeted intervention have seen decreases in incidents

6982273 since one may presume that the hostile action of georgia against south ossetia made its sovereignty
6982274 if you are referring to georgias soverignty russia had a moral obligation to stop the aggression of georgia by defending those in south ossetia but it didnt have a right to advance acrooss the georgian border and remain in order to ransack the country for its own strategic advantage
6982275 do you think members of the bush administration are telling the truth are mostly telling the truth but hiding something or are they mostly lying
6982276 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence i conjure you to believe me fellow citizens the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite foreign nation are liable to become suspected and odious while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests
6982277 you are advocating for an unhappy military suffering in obsequious silence which is not
6982278 your attitude that support for the military means allowing whatever administration is in power to abuse them is nonsensical

6982303 grounded in european antecedents specifically french but unmistakably american in style the paintings of robert de niro sr represent one of the foremost achievements in painterly representation de niros efforts to reconcile the real with the abstract through the use of brilliant draftsmanship bold fauvist inspired colors and confident gestural brushwork stand as one of the great achievements in postwar twentieth century american painting
6982304 hans hofmann reportedly considered de niro one of his two best students ever the other being virginia admiral de niros wife 1 thus it was no surprise when de niro emerged from the new york abstract expressionist school in the 1940s and became a leading member of the second generation of postwar american painters who turned to representational subject matter as a means of reinvigorating the tradition of painterly expression these painters a group that included larry rivers jane freilicher and paul resika reopened the discussion of what is possible in painting by returning to figuration and confronting the legacy of their art historical predecessors head on

6982309 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6982310 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6982311 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6982313 the overall survival detailed in the expanded fda approval of vidaza is extremely important for patients with higher risk mds a group with limited options and median survival of about 15 months with classical treatments
6982314 vidaza however is also effective across a broad range of mds subgroups including who classified aml patients the largest subgroup in our study
6982315 the clinical data from this randomized phase iii controlled study demonstrated that patients with higher risk mds treated with vidaza benefit from a significant survival advantage a critical measure of a drugs effectiveness
6982316 additionally the efficacy and safety profile of vidaza allows for long term therapy in patients with higher risk mds underscoring the ability to treat until disease progression for optimal survival benefit
6982317 this decision by the fda reflects the unprecedented survival advantage demonstrated by vidaza in patients with higher risk mds
6982318 vidaza is another example of celgene developing novel therapies for critical blood diseases that are enabling patients to live for years rather than weeks and months todays decision strengthens our companys ability to deliver vidaza and our other therapies to patients in need around the world

6982342 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
6982343 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
6982344 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place

6982356 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6982357 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6982358 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry
6982359 we believe that this company plans to sell the sydney site and it is about trying to increase the sale price of that site by transferring contracts there
6982360 its now incumbent on premier john brumby to indicate whether there has been any engagement with the company on the issue and whether the government could have done more to retain these jobs
6982361 he cant be out there patting himself on the back when there are new jobs and then vanishing as he has done when the jobs start disappearing themselves

6982365 all of this raises the issue that polite israeli society insists on sweeping under the rug israels repeated willingness to release terrorists for live and dead hostages makes clear the need to implement the death penalty against terrorist murderers the criminal code permits the death penalty to be used in cases of treason murder crimes against humanity genocide and crimes against the jewish people the problem is not the laws on the books the problem is the state prosecutions refusal to use them regardless of the nature of their crimes the state attorneys office refuses to request that judges sentence terrorists to death

6982370 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6982371 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6982375 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady has been discharged from beaumont hospital this afternoon flowing completion of his medical examinations
6982376 he has been given a clean bill of health and has told us he will return to work today when he will travel to london to be at the tottenham v sunderland match with
6982377 he was in great form and took a full part in the match
6982378 i saw him in the second half pacing up and down in the dressing room he was normal
6982379 the russian invasion of georgia was the first step to re establishing the russian empire it foreshadows the conquest of ukraine and moldova in the nearest future possibly in 2009
6982380 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
6982381 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
6982382 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
6982383 ive looked at every other possible candidate no one brings to a ticket what hillary brings eighteen million people committed to where shes going
6982384 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
6982385 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6982386 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
6982387 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
6982388 she is such a towering personality that she could have occupied a great deal of media real estate on her own complicating obamas challenge of communicating who he is directly to the public
6982389 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
6982390 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
6982391 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6982392 nadal is obviously playing really well but i think this surface and grand slam he has struggled at
6982393 federer is playing really well but his performance has dropped a little bit and beating djokovic a couple of times recently has given me confidence
6982394 its hard but i think if you want to win slams in any era you will have to have beaten great players to do it
6982395 its very hard to do but its definitely not impossible you have to go into for me anyway every tournament to win
6982396 i always feel if you set a goal to reach the third round if you do make it to the third round you almost are satisfied with what you achieved
6982397 set the goal high and try your best to win the tournament
6982398 i want to try to keep moving up the rankings and i think its time for me to go a little bit further at a grand slam
6982399 i have the potential to do that but you try not to look so far ahead go one match at a time just see what happens because once you get into the second week anything can happen
6982400 i think im stronger mentally and physically this season my game hasnt changed a whole lot but when youre physically in better shape it gives you extra confidence
6982401 you go on the court just worrying about the tennis instead of other things it gives you a better peace of mind

6982403 the aircraft had landed at dublin airport but it could have originated anywhere within the ryanair network it was obviously in the aircraft beforehand
6982404 a passenger found the cartridge in an overhead cabin when they were putting up their luggage
6982405 it is a matter for the airline to deal with now
6982406 dublin airport authority will not be launching an investigation into this incident

6982410 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
6982411 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
6982412 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
6982413 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
6982414 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
6982415 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or you will be arrested
6982416 ich wundere mich sowieso dass das bislang noch niemand forciert hat
6982417 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
6982418 shes called us mom and dad since she was eight years old
6982419 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6982420 it happens and it never leads to a diplomatic crisis
6982421 isnt this excessive why is the government overreacting like this
6982422 i love my country and i love my grandma but life is not really good i have a family here
6982423 please keep in touch with me i dont feel like we are what we could be given time i love you with all my heart and its hard letting you go but i know its something you need
6982424 i dont want to alienate you and i dont want to push you away but i dont want to feel this pain anymore i understand why you chose us not to be together but it sucks it sucks knowing that you might be someone elses it sucks knowing i cant hold you and it sucks knowing that ive done all the wrong things for you
6982425 i want you to hate me because it will be easier for me to be alone and accept the fact you and i didnt work and probably never will

6982427 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating that their funding needs are
6982428 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6982429 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
6982430 thus youre mine bound thus to wander eternal to never forget the cost i paid to free you
6982431 when you walk in off the back lot and see the amount of people and whats going on its like going to the county fair or a concert at pomona fairgrounds
6982432 i and a few community members and staff got together to discuss a way to bring the community together and give something back
6982433 the impetus of this was to highlight local talent that started in gardena it grows every year
6982434 i grew up playing clarinet and sax im a music fan
6982435 jazz is probably the most international language if you go overseas its far more listened to it crosses all cultural barriers
6982436 she was a real fighter and had a lot of integrity
6982437 she was a special kind of judge who did it all criminal probate civil
6982438 she treated everyone with respect and dignity and she never rushed to make a decision she took her time and gave everybody an opportunity to be heard
6982439 she was acknowledged as a real wizard doing civil law and her loss was really tremendous
6982440 pollution affects all of us but those who suffer from asthma are more sensitive and experience the effects more quickly and severely
6982441 oh its okay you screwed up you cant help it your brain doesnt work right
6982442 hes nice and all but is there something wrong with him
6982443 it was a two day fight and we lost an awful lot of guys
6982444 the people i knew best were the ones on that vietnam memorial wall
6982445 det er riktig at alkohol aldri har helbredet snue ingen kommentarer men det har en lege heller aldri gjort
6982446 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
6982447 they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic
6982448 dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of dive bombing and litter strewn around the town after a seagull has raided a bin
6982449 by preventing gulls from nesting and destroying nests when discovered we can actively discourage them from breeding in dumfries and hopefully force them to look elsewhere
6982450 i expect the task force to start making plans now ready to swing into action next spring to coincide with the next breeding season
6982451 if successful lessons learned will be shared with other local authorities so they can see what has worked in dumfries with a view to implementing an appropriate response to problems in their area
6982452 there is no doubt the dumfries population of gulls is getting bolder
6982453 they are now stealing food from peoples hands and harassing locals and visitors
6982454 its only a matter of time before a gull collides with someone and there is a serious injury
6982455 it is good that i didnt do an amazing performance in my first round because you dont want to waste it
6982456 i still have lots of things to improve on for the final i was hungry to get into the final and again my first dive wasnt so good but i slowly and surely made my way back
6982457 i was expecting to make the semi finals and after that i was not so sure
6982458 i knew i could make the final if i dived well but anything can happen in the olympics
6982459 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
6982460 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
6982461 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6982462 i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
6982463 normally it is my best dive i took off had a great start and i guess i just panicked in the middle of it kicked my feet too high and over rotated
6982464 sesungguhnya iblis telah putus asa untuk disembah oleh orang orang yang sholeh tetapi ia berusaha mengadu domba di antara mereka
6982465 ketika rasulullah sedang beritikaf di masjid saya mendatanginya di suatu malam dan bercerita
6982466 sesungguhnya setan berjalan di tubuh anak adam pada peredaran darah aku khawatir setan itu melontarkan kejahatan di hati kamu berdua sehingga timbul prasangka yang buruk
6982467 saya pernah duduk bersama rasulullah di sana ada dua orang yang sedang saling mencaci
6982468 akan aku ajarkan satu kalimat yang dapat menghilangkan marah ketika diucapkan
6982469 sesungguhnya manusia di zaman ini sudah meninggalkan ibadah dan sulit dikembalikan mengapa kita tidak mengerjakan sebagian peribadahan lalu kita bagus baguskan dengan tambahan dari kita agar manusia mau kembali beribadah
6982470 tambahan kebaikan tentu merupakan kebaikan juga maka tambahlah dalam sunnah tersebut suatu bentuk ibadah yang mirip dengan sunnah atau sandarkan ibadah baru pada sunnah tersebut
6982471 sesungguhnya manusia sudah jauh dari dien ini mengapa tidak kita buat hadist hadist yang dapat menakut nakuti mereka
6982472 kami memang berdusta namun kami bukan berdusta menentang rasulullah saw melainkan berdusta dalam rangka membela beliau
6982473 yang paling penting adalah berniat baik asal aku lalui waktu malamku tanpa menyimpan dengki dan kebencian pada manusia cukuplah sudah akhirnya orang tersebut meninggalkan banyak amalan amalan shaleh mencukupkan diri dengan niat baik saja demikian pula dalam tataran kelompok ketika kamu lihat segolongan orang berkata adalah kita harus mengenal keadaan riil kaum muslimin dan keadaan musuh musuh mereka dengan demikian hal paling penting adalah masalah masalah politis kita hidup di zaman orang orang berdasi dan berdiplomasi bukan di zamannya arab padang pasir
6982474 hal terpenting adalah hubunganmu kepada allah yaitu shalat kamupun harus zuhud dan bertaqwa lemparkan urusan urusan lain selain aspek aspek keruhanianmu
6982475 dan berpeganglah kepada tali agama allah secara bersama sama dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
6982476 betapa banyak pula yang berusaha untuk berbuat baik dipengaruhi setan untuk menunda nundanya
6982477 kamu lebih baik dari orang lain kamu melakukan shalat sementara orang lain banyak yang tidak shalat
6982478 kamu sudah mengerjakan ini dan itu lihatlah kamu beramal dan beramal
6982479 tinggalkanlah bidang tiu untuk orang lain yanglebih baik darimu dakwah adalah amal yang mulia amal bagi oarng yang jenius yang amat langkadan yang mendalam ilmunya
6982480 apa artinya diri saya disbanding syaikh ini apalah artinya diriku dibandingkan dengan orang alim ini
6982481 kalau aku bershadaqah terlihat olehnya dia akan menyangka kau riaya lebih baik aku tidak memberikan shadaqah ini
6982482 jika setan mendatangimu dalam shalat dan membisikan kepada kamu bahwa kamu riya perpanjanglah shalatmu
6982483 sesungguhnya itu tidak lain hanyalah setan yang menakut nakuti dengan kawan kawannya karena itu janganlah kamu takut kepada mereka tetap takulah kepada ku jika kamu benar benar orang orang beriman
6982484 setan menjanjikan menakut nakuti kamu dengan kefaqiran dan menyuruh kamu berbuat kejahatan
6982485 kalau kamu tinggalkan pekerjaan ini dimana kamu kan mendapatkan pekerjaan yang lainnya kamu akan menjadi sangat faqir
6982486 dan barang siapa yang bertaqwa kepada allah niscaya dia akan mengadakan baginya jalan keluar dan memberikannya rezki dari arah yang tidak disangka sangkanya
6982487 bagaimana aku hidup orang orang sudah pada kaya aku masih faqir
6982488 sesungguhnya setan itu tidak ada kekuasaannya atas orang orang beriman dan orang orang yang bertawakal hanya kepada rabb mereka saja
6982489 iblis berkata demi keagunganmu aku akan menyesatkan mereka semuanya kecuali hamba hambamu yang mukhlis di antara mereka
6982490 jika kamu ditimpa sesuatu godaan setan maka berlindunglah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetah
6982491 nadal is obviously playing really well but i think this surface and grand slam he has struggled at
6982492 federer is playing really well but his performance has dropped a little bit and beating djokovic a couple of times recently has given me confidence

6982500 you go on the court just worrying about the tennis instead of other things it gives you a better peace of mind
6982501 the similarities between downtown los angeles and broadway in particular are very striking to what existed here in san diego they took what was a blighted area with a lot of potential and made it into an active lively entertainment destination that is a true neighborhood
6982502 what is amazing to me is how theyve integrated older structures with new structures and at the same time provided multiple means of public transportation
6982503 the bill was certainly more comprehensive in its earlier forms
6982504 we think theres greater harm than good that can come from having those practices available in the subprime market
6982505 the bill is really directed at curbing abusive practices and less on banning things
6982506 responsible subprime lending is a good thing its irresponsible lending that we want to curb
6982507 its a very fine balancing act that were trying to keep
6982508 the bill doesnt arbitrarily limit credit and it doesnt ban products
6982509 banning products only limits capital the bill was a good example of what happens when all sides come together in good faith
6982510 at the end of the day we would still prefer a ban which we think would catch more of the troublemakers out there than this compromise language
6982511 less than 100 percent or to compromise what he knew was right or to leave any stone unturned
6982512 growing up we all got a sense of standing up for what was right and making a difference in the world and the importance of ethical behavior from my father
6982513 my father taught me that we seldom learn from our triumphs it is our losses that teach us
6982514 he had a terrific and often irreverent sense of humor and a loud laugh
6982515 i believe that when i do leave the world some of those who remember me will say that i left it better than when i began my lifes journey
6982516 i dont think ive ever seen anything comparing a home canned tomato product to a commercially canned product
6982517 there are not many studies that start with the raw fruits and vegetables and then track them all the way through their various potential processing and distribution channels
6982518 are we with heat just loosening the matrix of the plant and allowing us in the laboratory to analyze a higher content of that particular nutrient
6982519 even though we have a great vegetable garden i can plant 25 to 30 tomato plants and only yield 30 to 40 pounds of tomatoes
6982520 the four of us picked for no more than 20 to 25 minutes and we had 70 pounds of tomatoes
6982521 in the end theyll pick maybe six or seven tomatoes
6982522 i had to laugh when a guy lifted the last bucket into his pickup truck and said whew that was tough poor guy his work had only begun
6982523 turns out theyre going to go home and invite several of their friends over and have a canning party
6982524 riley and fletcher sat there and peeled all the blanched tomatoes
6982525 i want the kids to see that food comes from the earth
6982526 i want them to get a little mud on their shoes
6982527 tart flavor firm pulp bright red color low seed count and easily removed skin
6982528 brushing off complaints from an anonymous developer who complained about a lack of credit for working on
6982529 earlier this year i complained about the lack of skin color choices for the wii title
6982530 unfortunately by the time it had gone to manufacturing it was something that couldnt be changed in the original product but when we were developing for the ds it was the first thing that we put in there because we knew we needed a larger variety
6982531 one of the highest priced sold items was an autographed olympic speedo swim cap from a special appearance he did in baltimore in 2004 it sold for 645
6982532 in spite of everything that a ball was indeed delightful
6982533 there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
6982534 i care neither what they say nor what they feel they will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me that can attach a man of sense i wish the discovery may do them any good and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness they will be angry
6982535 one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
6982536 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
6982537 they the milf must show good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating and that good faith is to surrender the two who perpetrated these atrocities and stop condoning it at least if not encouraging
6982538 we are pragmatic enough to realize that we dont know who is sincere and who is not and so we shall give them that option through dialogue however if they refuse to heed that call and seek another path we shall be ready to take appropriate action
6982539 i think it is prudent for us to assume the worst but hope for the best
6982540 mary will be saved if she makes herself male because every female who makes herself male will become fit for the kingdom of god
6982541 is tonight really special enough to be a tomato sauce night i dont think so
6982542 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
6982543 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
6982544 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
6982545 even the smallest california tomato processor processes more tons of tomatoes than most countries in the world do
6982546 we have a 90 to a 100 day harvest whereas you have other areas that have a 45 day harvest
6982547 and given the long sunny days and the dry conditions we typically have less disease pressure
6982548 in california just prior to the introduction of mechanized harvesting in the early 1960s there were over 4 000 growers by 1973 when virtually 100 percent of the crop was mechanically harvested there were less than 600
6982549 agri food globalization in perspective international restructuring in the processing tomato industry
6982550 the only way that these guys are making any money on tomatoes is by volume processed tomatoes are basically a commodity
6982551 when the hills dry out down south along interstate 5 the leafhoppers come down and they spread a disease called curly top that kills the tomato
6982552 if we dont have that program and especially if the rules change in the middle of the game its a real problem its much more difficult to break even
6982553 we dont mind if they share it with us we just dont want them to take it all
6982554 this tribunal aims to topple the current government to make a new sudan a sudan that is free of arabs and far from islam
6982555 if there is nothing to be afraid of let their kids be x rayed
6982556 a caucasian girl is going to fuse her knee centers at about age 15 theyre going to fuse their iliac crest at about age 16 and part of the elbow will start fusing around 13 or 14
6982557 of course everybody who gets arrested says they are 17
6982558 in the view of the constitution in the eye of the law there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens there is no caste here our constitution is color blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens in respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law the humblest is the peer of the most powerful
6982559 injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly
6982560 summer afternoon summer afternoon to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the english language
6982561 the excitement of learning separates youth from old age as long as youre learning youre not old
6982562 the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them glory and danger alike and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it
6982563 no man or woman is an island to exist just for yourself is meaningless
6982564 do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do
6982565 a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives
6982566 on my income tax 1040 it says check this box if you are blind i wanted to put a check mark about three inches away
6982567 you look forward to it like a birthday party when youre a kid you think something wonderful is going to happen
6982568 birthdays are good for you statistics show that the people who have the most live the longest
6982569 discourage litigation persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees expenses and waste of time as a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man there will still be business enough
6982570 its snowing still and freezing however we havent had an earthquake lately
6982571 new years day now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual
6982572 at times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us

6982810 it is never too late to be what you might have been
6982811 and if you want your pedal power to do anything meaningful you have to run efficient devices
6982812 i was always interested in alternative energy and solar in particular
6982813 i was living in portland ore where solar is not as much of an option so i thought what else could i do
6982814 id been on a swim team for years and i was in pretty good shape and i thought there must be a way to get some power going
6982815 if you want to save energy dont drive to the gym
6982816 just gradually ramp up as it starts asking for more power
6982817 now you wont really feel the draw until you try to start preventing that from dropping
6982818 well unfortunately youve got to heat a substantial amount of water before the first drop comes out
6982819 it really brings it home to actually feel how hard you have to pedal to make something go
6982820 and thats something that people will occasionally ask me on the web site so do you actually have to pedal harder when youre pedaling bigger things like tvs
6982821 and it shows that the concept of work that electricity is doing work as opposed to just being off or on is not familiar to people
6982822 hats off to all the guys for the way they have reacted in the last couple of weeks
6982823 there is so much buzz energy and pride in the dressing room
6982824 ive tried to do a decent job all my life and i think it is rubbing off on the lads
6982825 freddie is a superstar some people are born into this world to be superstars the ability he has with a ball is phenomenal he can run up in the nets with one arm behind his back and hit a length
6982826 as for harmy this is the stage he belongs on not in front of 34 people for durham but in front of 34 000 for england
6982827 he is one of the best bowlers in the world and there is every chance he will be performing for england in antigua in november
6982828 i retired from one day cricket for cricketing reasons and im coming back for cricketing reasons
6982829 it was nice just to get a start and once you get in and saw off the new ball it was a reasonable surface
6982830 it was good to finish the day not out and hopefully i can really go on and bat for a long time we got a poor start again but we have fought back a bit we have got to fight hard and keep scrapping and scrapping and scrapping we have got to take things half hour by half hour really there is obviously a lot of work to do
6982831 as you are well aware its been a disappointing season so far
6982832 but in the cricket i have played in the last three or four weeks i have started to find a little bit more rhythm in my game
6982833 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past
6982834 this was the first series in which they could not perform i feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade
6982835 to put laxman in that list is not fair since he performed well sourav and rahul although were having it tough but you cannot write them off
6982836 mendis is an exceptional bowler he is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy variety and trajectory nevertheless he has to make sure he continues to improve so that he doesnt become predictable
6982837 it is a long series still four more games to play we always start well and end up messing it up a bit so i think nottingham on tuesday is a huge fixture for us
6982838 the fact is we havent had the greatest build up to this series
6982839 there is a lot to improve on before nottingham we were way below par we know we can improve a hell of a lot and that is encouraging
6982840 things are working out right now but its down to the way the guys have reacted in the last couple of weeks
6982841 not the raspberries its bad enough that youve all been pecking the heirloom tomatoes
6982842 they like to sleep in trees this time of year
6982843 millal t pselt ta siia sattus seda ei oska keegi elda aga ilmselt nii kaks p eva tagasi p hjatuulega

6982845 even if you gave me a new if you gave me the xbox 720 id say all right its got 32 gpus a terabyte of memory and weve got rid of hard disks its stored in the cloud having dreamed the dream he then continued to explain that of course people would want more posted by haritori yeah its all very well but cant we have a standard across the sku s its about analysing what youve got and the new ways you can do things
6982846 in the view of the constitution in the eye of the law there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens there is no caste here our constitution is color blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens in respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law the humblest is the peer of the most powerful
6982847 injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly
6982848 summer afternoon summer afternoon to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the english language
6982849 the excitement of learning separates youth from old age as long as youre learning youre not old
6982850 the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them glory and danger alike and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it
6982851 no man or woman is an island to exist just for yourself is meaningless
6982852 do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do
6982853 a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives
6982854 on my income tax 1040 it says check this box if you are blind i wanted to put a check mark about three inches away
6982855 you look forward to it like a birthday party when youre a kid you think something wonderful is going to happen
6982856 birthdays are good for you statistics show that the people who have the most live the longest
6982857 discourage litigation persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees expenses and waste of time as a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man there will still be business enough
6982858 its snowing still and freezing however we havent had an earthquake lately
6982859 new years day now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual
6982860 at times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us
6982861 its the job thats never started as takes longest to finish
6982862 justice without strength is helpless strength without justice is tyrannical
6982863 home computers are being called upon to perform many new functions including the consumption of homework formerly eaten by the dog
6982864 what we see depends mainly on what we look for
6982865 your integrity will affect your destiny dont leave home without it
6982866 a deadline is negative inspiration still its better than no inspiration at all
6982867 an unfulfilled vocation drains the color from a mans entire existence
6982868 it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
6982869 a knowledge of the path cannot be substituted for putting one foot in front of the other
6982870 you will never find time for anything you must make it
6982871 education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire
6982872 striving for excellence motivates you striving for perfection is demoralizing
6982873 it is never too late to be what you might have been
6982874 we dont expect full digital distribution of new games to be a threat due to game size
6982875 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
6982876 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6982877 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
6982878 innocently martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
6982879 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations
6982880 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
6982881 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
6982882 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6982883 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
6982884 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
6982885 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6982886 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6982887 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
6982888 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
6982889 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
6982890 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
6982891 taken the first steps in the state of florida toward legally changing his last name to ocho cinco
6982892 daddy i want to be called xontar the andromeda galaxys prince of pounding
6982893 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6982894 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6982895 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best
6982896 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
6982897 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
6982898 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6982899 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6982900 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6982901 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6982902 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6982903 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
6982904 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6982905 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6982906 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6982907 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6982908 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6982909 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6982910 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6982911 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6982912 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6982913 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6982914 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6982915 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6982916 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6982917 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6982918 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6982919 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6982920 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6982921 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6982922 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6982923 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6982924 she was as much a victim in this whole thing as anyone
6982925 obviously not physically but to have to witness the things she had to see and go through the loss she had to endure is not an easy thing its a testament to her strength that shes working through it
6982926 we talk a couple of times a day three if need be we try to stay in as constant contact as we can because even though im here we all are in it together
6982927 she said she appreciates our effort and all that weve done
6982928 certainly its good for her family to see were out here trying as hard as we can whether thats a tribute or not is up to them the last two weeks have been a roller coaster i would say as a person who is not fond of roller coasters
6982929 the olympics is already emotionally charged fighting for your country for pride then you throw in the bachman tragedy you throw in miles britton a make a wish foundation kid we had in our camp his only wish was to watch usa volleyball play
6982930 im not so sure four years ago the team wouldnt have folded
6982931 im going to attribute that change to hugh mccutcheon when he came in he decided we werent going to settle for being middle of the road for being maybe a contender he got a new philosophy of working hard working together no superstars everyone bought into it
6982932 obviously we would have understood if he wanted to go home
6982933 the olympics are the olympics its not life its two weeks of your life that are important but not nearly as important as your family your wife and her family
6982934 is i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here given that responsibility given that im the leader of this team i know theres some accountability on my part to make sure im here and able to do my job
6982935 that is one of the many admirable traits about him
6982936 its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done ive got to get back where im needed
6982937 cuatro de nuestros soldados han sido hechos m rtires mientras que hemos matado a 35 milicianos y atacado varios de sus escondites
6982938 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6982939 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6982940 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6982941 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6982942 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6982943 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6982944 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6982945 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6982946 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6982947 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6982948 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6982949 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6982950 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6982951 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6982952 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6982953 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6982954 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6982955 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6982956 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6982957 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6982958 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6982959 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6982960 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6982961 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6982962 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6982963 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6982964 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6982965 his variation seems unreal he could snare 500 wickets by the time people are able to figure him out
6982966 there are few quality spinners on the horizon and im a great admirer of the spinning craft exhibited by mendis
6982967 hes not looking for dot balls hes looking for a wicket with every delivery
6982968 the way he bamboozled indias batsmen in the tests was amazing
6982969 the indian batsmen have come across a pair of top class spinners after a long time
6982970 theyll have to concentrate more and plan better to save themselves from embarrassment it amazes me why the indian batsmen are trying to read mendis by the length of his deliveries they ought to be watching the bowlers wrist and fingers but our batsmen are trying to reach the pitch of the ball
6982971 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6982972 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6982973 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6982974 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6982975 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6982976 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6982977 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6982978 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6982979 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6982980 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6982981 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6982982 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6982983 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6982984 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6982985 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6982986 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6982987 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6982988 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6982991 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6982992 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6982993 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6983001 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6983015 the rest of the time the judges are busy lazing around and taking bribes unashamedly
6983016 after we were called to the bar one of our classmates didnt take a month finding a judge who could share booty with men charged with robbery with violence in exchange for their freedom the clean judges at the kenyan judiciary could sit comfortably in a family car

6983019 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6983020 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6983021 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6983022 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6983023 we did feel like giving up and i lost count of the number of times i had the phone hung up on me
6983024 we dug deep for all we could find and it was a case of people power winning the day
6983025 after lengthy consultations with severn trent water and our legal representatives i can confirm the cost of repairing the defective sewers will not be re charged to the owners of properties in these streets
6983026 the cost will be met by the city council and or severn trent water
6983027 i appreciate this matter has been under investigation for a long time and the issue of re charging home owners for the cost of the work has caused concern and anxiety
6983028 we had all had surveys carried out before we bought the houses from the council and nothing showed up in the councils own searches
6983029 when we were told we would have to pay for the repairs we were furious it wasnt our fault the sewers were not adopted and wed been paying water rates for the past 30 years like everyone else
6983030 we were prepared to go to court if that was what it took
6983031 its a shame this was not sorted when we first found out about the sewers as most of the information we found came from council offices we knew the sewers had never been conveyed to us and the council couldnt find any proof either
6983032 were grateful for all the evening telegraphs help and i dont think it would have been resolved so fast without it
6983033 once the government transfers responsibility for all private sewers to the local water companies this situation should not arise again which we are very pleased about
6983034 its late turn off your stereo and get yourself into bed
6983035 we wait in silence for gods voice to reach us we linger in his presence for his peace and his power to flow over and around us
6983036 it feeling like gold this is my first big meet and this is my second year running track and field so im really proud of myself and the rest of guys right now it feels like gold
6983037 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6983038 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6983039 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6983040 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6983041 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6983042 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6983043 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6983044 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6983045 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6983046 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6983047 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6983048 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6983049 the last eight nine 10 games this team is playing probably the worst baseball we have all year long
6983050 some of these guys are putting a little pressure on themselves we need to play baseball and concentrate on achieving and not worry about the down side
6983051 everyones wanting to get that big hit or get that inning ignited and putting pressure on themselves
6983052 we just need to relax and everything will work out
6983053 stay hungry and not be complacent and play the way were capable of day in and day out
6983054 i dont think its the fact that were 15 games up in the american league west standings its that were tired and kind of going through the motions
6983055 some guys are gripping the bat too tightly and squeezing the sawdust out of it
6983056 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6983057 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6983058 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6983059 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6983060 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6983061 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6983062 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6983063 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6983064 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6983065 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6983066 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6983067 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6983068 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6983069 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6983070 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6983071 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6983072 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6983073 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6983074 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6983075 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6983076 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6983077 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6983078 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6983079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6983080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6983081 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6983082 if you interview women in auckland and waikato somewhere between 17 and 25 will say they were sexually abused in childhood
6983083 that was more than 12 of the females and the ratio in boys was about a quarter of that
6983084 its about medical care and providing the best medical care for these patients but also about ensuring justice is done for either the victim or that not improper prosecution is undertaken
6983085 its not like you see on tv where its wrapped up in 45 minutes
6983086 our investigations can take months if not a period of years by the time we get through the court process
6983087 many women survive sexual abuse and go on and do very well but its an enormous burden thats borne by society
6983088 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6983089 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6983090 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6983091 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6983092 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6983093 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6983094 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6983095 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6983096 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6983097 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6983098 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6983099 catal n es aquel que vive y trabaja en catalunya
6983100 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6983101 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6983102 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6983103 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6983104 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6983105 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6983106 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6983107 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6983108 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6983109 i dropped i guess from about two or three metres it was pretty big i must have fallen well
6983110 i was really winded but i guess i was up relatively quickly
6983111 i was way back off the pack from the very start other than that it was great i was picking off riders as i went through
6983112 i felt really good physically i felt really strong and technically most of the time i was really good there was just the one section i had trouble with
6983113 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6983114 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6983115 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6983116 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6983117 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6983118 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6983119 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6983120 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6983121 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6983122 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6983123 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6983124 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6983125 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6983126 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6983127 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6983128 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6983129 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6983130 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6983131 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6983132 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6983133 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6983134 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6983135 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6983136 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6983137 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6983138 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6983139 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6983140 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6983141 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6983142 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6983143 i hope the wheaties box and all those types of things happen
6983144 id love for this to be a spark for the decathlon and bring it back to the forefront of track and field
6983145 and i was before it was just about me giving him the crown for the next four years
6983146 some students anticipate that the class will be simply a discussion of what the national media reported that morning
6983147 we will certainly discuss daily campaign news when appropriate but only when it speaks to larger questions about the current races and how elections in general work
6983148 both of them are analytical thinkers who ask more thoughtful questions than the typical ones we hear on the pundit talk shows
6983149 many will enroll in the course as strong republican or democratic partisans and they will not understand what it is like to win or lose a political race
6983150 we will emphasize that the american political process never really has closure there are going to be some years when your party does great and some when your party loses thats what american politics is all about
6983151 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6983152 listening to ipods is a big thing and talking on cell phones
6983153 its good to see our currency take us further when we come here
6983154 this loving person is a person who abhors waste waste of time waste of human potential how much time we waste as if we were going to live forever
6983155 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6983156 i was so scared because bombs were falling on our homes but now it seems people will start returning and everything will be alright
6983157 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 7 50 p m moscow time 4 50 p m british time
6983158 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
6983159 cuatro de nuestros soldados han sido hechos m rtires mientras que hemos matado a 35 milicianos y atacado varios de sus escondites
6983160 if i were still the boss there id pick bob costas
6983161 i truly appreciate als comments but nbc has many qualified journalists with more extensive news backgrounds than my own so i think ill keep my night job
6983162 bob costas or bryant gumbel both are smart quick and do their homework either would excel but its not my call or als
6983163 confidence in the war on terror and on the situation in iraq is at the highest level of the last four years
6983164 who would have thought a year ago iraq would not have been an absolute lay down issue for barack obama
6983165 now accept drilling as a necessary evil for the lack of a better phrase
6983166 the biggest thing that changed the race was john mccains call for offshore oil drilling
6983167 it is not about offshore drilling per se but people are looking at the price of gas as the driving force in all conversations about the economy and the fact that john mccain was looking for a new policy that was aggressively trying to find new energy was a positive economic policy
6983168 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
6983169 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6983170 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
6983171 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6983172 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
6983173 innocently martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
6983174 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations
6983175 masalah urusan saya pribadi itu menjadi urusan pribadi sendri juga
6983176 mungkin udah terlalu lama gua mengambil peran yang baik baik saja
6983177 sebagai pemain sinetron memerankan tokoh antagonis itu tantangan buat dia
6983178 aku sita supaya tidak bisa dijual supaya nanti bisa jatuh ke anak anak
6983179 i think one bad dive from anyone and theyre out of the competition thats the high standard of the competition
6983180 i failed to get my body full adjusted this morning hopefully i will get better tonight
6983181 i explained to prosecutors transactions of the funds during the elections
6983182 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
6983183 but its not my place to judge her i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver
6983184 i lost a bit of my concentration in the second set i dont know why
6983185 ive just recovered from a cold ive played a lot of matches these last couple of weeks tonight im paying for it
6983186 ive rekindled the fire ive found a great feel around the court im really on the right track
6983187 ive known caroline since i was eleven i knew that you have to be 100 percent in order to beat her it was just not the case today
6983188 i feel really confident its been a really good month for me
6983189 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didnt happen
6983190 oh no this man is going to yell at me
6983191 it means a lot to them you think fruits and vegetables are something trivial to them its not
6983192 im not im not im probably the worst there is
6983193 when i was growing up this is the street everyone wanted to live on
6983194 its a community shes very well connected and very in touch with
6983195 i think her strength is her ability to work the back rooms to bring people together
6983196 if you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen
6983197 how can rob ford think he can come between me and them i love them i really love them you should see the e mails im getting referring to my critics as shrieking hyenas
6983198 the properties were a little messy but im getting them cleaned up
6983199 i caution that this is not only a zoning matter
6983200 you have to accept the fact that we have found proof that the oversight has been negligent in nature
6983201 as always the city gets left holding the bag but i mean somebodys got to clean it up but the province theyve created this industry to politically sever themselves from disasters
6983202 and behind the staple was a lovely man named david who you could find at any time either behind his counter or outside standing beside the indian statue smoking a cigar with one or many of his friends
6983203 that billboard is the cover of a porn magazine and its screaming at yonge and dundas square
6983204 i dont think you need a phd to recognize that this is nothing but an ad for and ill put this gently anal intercourse
6983205 it is a little bit disconcerting to see what feminism has evolved into
6983206 when theres a group of people attempting to shame female creativity female beauty female pride under the auspices of protecting women its really really scary
6983207 its a beautiful picture shes an artist its a celebration of her own beauty
6983208 the way in which the model was posed and photographed in clear focus from the rear to emphasize the models buttocks was demeaning and degrading to women
6983209 in the vast vast majority of decisions an advertiser will comply with council
6983210 perhaps what they dont realize theyre disapproving of is a womans pride
6983211 and im sure theyd be thrilled by the publicity and its the only thing thats keeping me for the moment from grabbing a billboard and standing in front of the store
6983212 the cyclists in the city of toronto have a bit of an attitude issue
6983213 dishwashers and people collecting welfare all the way to lawyers
6983214 people are not only buying them because they are environmentally friendly
6983215 theyre practical you dont have to deal with parking its easier to get around and its a lot of fun
6983216 there should be space for motorized and non motorized vehicles
6983217 personally i get worried every time that i see something with that much momentum going fast on bike lanes
6983218 im not sure if im totally against it up front theres a lot of people out there who cant participate in cycling because of health problems
6983219 i thought that i would have every 16 17 18 19 year old breaking my door down because now you dont have to take the bloody bus but its not cool enough for the youth market
6983220 there were many chess clubs in toronto but they busted them up and that was on purpose
6983221 thats a good question but youre not going to get an answer to that its personal
6983222 it means that were going to have a new board of directors new president stuff like that
6983223 kenneth platt he was an engineer at campbells soup but he died last year i believe he was one of the better players too
6983224 hes a fanatic day and night he plays non stop
6983225 i could have hired a bunch of actors and put them in costume
6983226 but i want the real deal im all about operating in that small exclusive space where most people just wouldnt go
6983227 im creating a play where hopefully the audience will enjoy every act of the production
6983228 i want them to come in and say ah or as i like to say experience the big goose bumps
6983229 the word toronto will be embossed on the spine and it will be black on black
6983230 in my own area of research which involves very detailed simulations of global warming we have never really been able to run competitive models
6983231 but we will be in the position now to say things that are truly useful to policy makers
6983232 we are now leapfrogging government in a very very significant way
6983233 every aspect of the system has been put together to be the most powerful and yet the most energy efficient
6983234 if were able to do this then we will have something thats truly special
6983235 the aerospace institute wants to make more efficient aircraft the people who are in the physics department will be involved in the next level of optical internet
6983236 we all have agendas which if successful will be great for the university
6983237 one is the further transformation of yorkville over time so many of the streets in the neighbourhood now are very vibrant when you look at cumberland terrace the design of the building does not really contribute to life on the street
6983238 apples been on the street looking for a large chunk crate amp barrels been on the street looking for a large chunk
6983239 its all condos now the mom and pop stores are gone
6983240 i dont see why they need it they dont need more condos they dont need more office towers
6983241 what were trying to do is animate the streetscape and make it more of a vibrant pedestrian experience
6983242 were thrilled that someone has come in with an application to redevelop cumberland terrace
6983243 redeveloping the terrace is only going to add to the change that weve seen in the last two decades
6983244 this event and the scramble now to do proper inspections which should have been done before clearly show the mcguinty government has failed to show any proper oversight
6983245 they have been negligent in not ensuring that the tssa did its job and they have put people at risk as a result
6983246 taking the appropriate action and making any changes necessary to the tssa very soon
6983247 distinctive approach to the arts and an exclusivity factor that may hold just the cachet you desire
6983248 i have my pink tie and matching pink underwear on in case you were wondering
6983249 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
6983250 not only for me but for the whole island it would bring more people here and we need more people
6983251 pelee was a microcosm of a lot of the policy tensions that were going on related to endangered species in the province
6983252 everyone said look at the situation on pelee thats the situation we have to address if we cant resolve pelee then how the hell are we going to do this on a provincial basis
6983253 oh my god we were under terrible strain here because development was almost coming to a standstill
6983254 if you had endangered species habitat somewhere you couldnt build at all there was no negotiation on it
6983255 there was no flexibility in the old act to do things creatively
6983256 the goal of the act is to raise the tide for all boats it provides protection and recovery of species first and foremost but it gives us a bunch of other tools so we can still get the benefits of our economy as well
6983257 if were able to pull it off its going to be an example of how the new endangered species act works
6983258 were talking about a community where there are just nine students in its school where businesses are closing
6983259 theyve had enough disappointment and enough setbacks and the rest of it we have to get this right

6983271 no sense of what is at the core of duty of the public service
6983272 we were rather shocked when we saw this cub in harrods in a department store in a very small cage not only was he totally entrancing we must be able to do something better for him he cant stay in a cage this size
6983273 when he first starts seeing us hes looking looking is it us is it us and then suddenly he says right this is them and down he comes and there wasnt a moment that we ever doubted that it was going to be a wonderful greeting we never doubted it
6983274 he was with wild lionesses he had a litter of cubs and his genes had been passed on back into the wild after that time we saw him he was never seen again it was like a final farewell he was completely integrated back into the wild
6983275 you know you cant raise your voice like that when the lion gets here

6983279 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
6983280 i go in once a day and pray for him
6983281 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
6983282 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him

6983284 scores of chinese air passengers have smashed computers and desks and clashed with police after a night stranded at an airport without accommodation state media said frustration at mysterious delays diversions and cancellations have at times boiled over into violence at chinese airports as passengers try to storm grounded aircraft and police are brought in to keep the peace there have also been cases in which passengers after delayed arrivals have refused to get off the planes in protest

6983286 man who is slow to learn spiritual truths is still slower to unlearn familiar errors
6983287 why dont you just mind your own business and let people just do what they want
6983288 brothers if someone is caught up in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently but watch yourself or you may also be tempted carry each others burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ
6983289 i was already a seasonsed mario badescu user when i tried this product for the first time i had heard about it in a magazine but i was skeptical about products making promises to quickly heal my acne once i tried it and it actually worked overnight i was hooked and i use it anytime i get a breakout i recommend this product for anyone with mild acne it really is the fastest and best product i have ever used
6983290 an unusual though obvious metaphor for the 9 11 terrorist attacks

6983292 what i do find annoying is that novell is continuing to feed microsofts fud machine about linux
6983293 microsoft is about to embark on a new advertising campaign designed to make people love it again and not merely endure it
6983294 remember when jason matasow asked how can microsoft not be evil the question remains unanswered
6983295 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux
6983296 weve struggled in the second round of the playoffs these guys the mustangs are always in the playoffs so we had to come up here and that was a big challenge for us
6983297 we just wanted to play the type of defense we did last year
6983298 weve got to work a lot harder guys have to fight through a little adversity there especially when they got up by two touchdowns they seemed to do whatever they wanted to but well get back to work im good with what weve got

6983303 we did work so hard for senator clinton to make her the nominee it is really hard to deal with but we know that senator obama was and is a great candidate
6983304 in my gut it tells me if you put hillary on that ticket its like johnson and kennedy
6983305 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6983306 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression
6983307 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
6983308 confidence in the war on terror and on the situation in iraq is at the highest level of the last four years
6983309 who would have thought a year ago iraq would not have been an absolute lay down issue for barack obama
6983310 now accept drilling as a necessary evil for the lack of a better phrase
6983311 the biggest thing that changed the race was john mccains call for offshore oil drilling
6983312 it is not about offshore drilling per se but people are looking at the price of gas as the driving force in all conversations about the economy and the fact that john mccain was looking for a new policy that was aggressively trying to find new energy was a positive economic policy

6983316 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6983317 do a search on this forum and see how theyve had to defend themselves
6983318 better you dont reply because that will just start an argument
6983319 oh yea such and such new defensive package is going to give eli manning fits you can bet the house on that one
6983320 oh yea mccain knows way more about foreign policy than obama so he has to be the better candidate for dealing with iraq
6983321 mccain has been involved in it for longer than obama
6983322 such and such is a great guard because hes only given up 2 1 sacks per year over the last three years and he also run blocks well as evidenced by some running backs 1400 yards per year
6983323 i think mccain has a better understanding of some subject because his voting record over the last five years in retrospect has turned out to be far more correct than obama
6983324 i ask the nepalese army police armed police and the national investigation department to forget the bitter past born out of the conflict and urge them to forge national unity and move ahead
6983325 i assure them that there will be no prejudices or bias against them
6983326 the new governments main responsibility is to complete the peace process and draft a new constitution within the next two years
6983327 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socioeconomic issues such as poverty unemployment and other problems and we will work to bring about a modern industrial economy for which a private public partnership model will be followed

6983334 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6983335 gary your cobbler recipe prompts me to send you details of a new war in the soft drinks industry over stevia kind regards barrie
6983336 purecircle could be winner in pepsi v coca cola stevia wars
6983337 as both pepsico and coca cola gear up to launch beverages sweetened with stevia it could be that their common supplier purecircle is the real winner in the race to be first to market
6983338 we are absolutely assuming that this product will be free to use in the usa from here on in
6983339 we supply high purity reb a both to cargill and to pepsico we started off with an exclusive contact with cargill that ended a few weeks ago we have extended the contract for a further length of time on a non exclusive basis
6983340 market maker as oppose to being part of somebodys supply chain
6983341 we aim to carry on and make the investments that we have made already in our supply chain and are continuing to make and that they lead to large contracts with large suppliers
6983342 we are talking pretty much with every food and beverage manufacturer that anybody has every heard of and the interest is strong and genuine
6983343 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6983344 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6983345 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6983346 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6983347 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6983348 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6983349 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6983350 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6983351 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6983352 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6983353 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6983354 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6983355 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6983356 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6983357 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6983358 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6983359 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6983360 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6983361 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6983362 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6983363 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6983364 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6983365 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6983366 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6983367 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6983368 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6983369 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6983370 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6983371 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6983372 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6983373 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6983374 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6983375 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6983376 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6983377 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6983378 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6983379 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6983380 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6983381 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6983382 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6983383 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6983384 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6983385 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6983386 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6983387 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6983388 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6983389 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6983390 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6983391 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6983392 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6983393 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6983394 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6983395 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6983396 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6983397 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6983398 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6983399 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6983400 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6983401 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6983402 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6983403 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6983404 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6983405 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6983406 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6983407 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6983408 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6983409 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6983410 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6983411 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6983412 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6983413 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6983414 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6983415 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6983416 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6983417 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6983418 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6983419 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6983420 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6983421 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6983422 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6983423 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6983424 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6983425 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6983426 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6983427 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6983428 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6983429 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6983430 this is a planning took where all things are going
6983431 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6983432 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
6983433 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6983434 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6983435 i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
6983436 the defendant posted or caused the said defamatory words to be posted and published in the internet and circulated worldwide
6983437 why is mr odinga trying to undermine the vice president in his home turf
6983438 the vp has not sponsored anyone to undermine mr odinga in his stronghold
6983439 if he has been fired its for reasons best known to the minister not the vp
6983440 theres no mutual suspicion at a political level however there are people in odm k who feel that the so called rebellion by two mps has the pms hand in it
6983441 if this allegation is being made it is downright bizarre the vice president and the prime minister are serving in one government there is no reason at all for the prime minister to plant spies on the vice president
6983442 the two mr muteti and mulwa have been sacrificed they are probably innocent of the charges facing them from their party leaders
6983443 when they started it little did they know that we had the resources and ability to dismantle their plans we simply employed counter intelligence manoeuvres that made their initiatives look amateurish
6983444 if they think that they can have mwau in a cage they are mistaken i have the capability of collecting information from any angle and then dealing with that information appropriately
6983445 but we can move levels around on servers whenever we want but you wont have access to the japanese servers
6983446 at jfk airport denying basic rights is just another day at the office

6983450 the greatest evildoers are those who dont remember because they have never given thought to the matter
6983451 now what are they men at all or small movable forts and magazines at the service of some unscrupulous man in power visit the navy yard and behold a marine such a man as an american government can make or such as it can make a man with its black arts a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity
6983452 not as men mainly but as machines with their bodies
6983453 put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones

6983470 au erordentlich schwierig zwischen privat und nicht privat zu unterscheiden
6983471 dass die privatheit empfindlich verletzt wird d rfen diese daten gar nicht erst erhoben werden
6983472 es ist unzureichend dass sch uble nach einer online durchsuchung nur zwei bka beamte pr fen lassen will ob der kernbereich privater lebensgestaltung eines verd chtigen tangiert wird
6983473 entweder sollte ein richter oder ein vertreter des bundesdatenschutzbeauftragten herangezogen werden
6983474 das ist eine unzureichende definition so kann berall jede wohnung ins visier genommen werden in der sich ein verd chtiger aufh lt
6983475 nach dem vorschlag des innenministers muss einer der beiden bka beamten ohnehin die bef higung zum richteramt haben
6983476 sowieso ein gericht entscheiden ob die daten verwertet werden d rfen oder sofort zu l schen sind ob man dar ber hinaus von vornherein einen richter damit befassen muss werden wir diskutieren das ist aber letztlich kein gro er dissens
6983477 wir sollten aufh ren den eindruck zu erwecken dieser staat berwache seine b rger
6983478 eine neue art von polizei die gleichzeitig ein neuer geheimdienst ist
6983479 ich sehe voraus dass wir wieder nach karlsruhe m ssen

6983484 das bundesverfassungsgericht hat heute best tigt dass die grundgesetz nderung zur akustischen wohnraum berwachung der sogenannte gro e lauschangriff nicht gegen die verfassung verst t
6983485 die vorschriften der strafprozessordnung zur durchf hrung der akustischen berwachung von wohnraum zu zwecken der strafverfolgung
6983486 das war ein gro er tag f r den rechtsstaat und den datenschutz
6983487 dieses richtungsweisende urteil korrigiert den gesetzgeber in einer frage von grunds tzlicher bedeutung auch wenn es davon absieht den lauschangriff als verfassungswidrig zu bezeichnen
6983488 ich freue mich dass die karlsruher richter meine rechtsauffassung best tigt haben dass bei einem mit ganz erheblichen grundrechtseingriffen verbundenen ermittlungsinstrument verfahrenssicherungen auf hohem niveau zum schutz der b rgerrechte eingezogen werden m ssen
6983489 das bundesverfassungsgericht hat in seiner heutigen entscheidung die grunds tzliche verfassungsrechtliche zul ssigkeit der sogenannten onlinedurchsuchung anerkannt
6983490 ich gehe davon aus dass nunmehr die beabsichtigte und von allen experten und polizeipraktikern f r notwendig gehaltene regelung im bka gesetz so rasch wie m glich umgesetzt werden kann
6983491 die intellektuelle lust am antizipierten ausnahmezustand ist kein guter ratgeber
6983492 wer mehr sicherheit in freiheit will der sollte den pragmatismus mehr lieben als das spiel mit dem grenzfall
6983493 das bundesverfassungsgericht hat heute im eilverfahren entschieden dass es auch weiterhin m glich bleibt telekommunikationsverkehrsdaten sechs monate lang zu speichern
6983494 zu begr en da die grunds tzliche pflicht der telekommunikationsunternehmen zur speicherung der f r die arbeit der sicherheitsbeh rden unerl sslichen verkehrsdaten aufrechterhalten worden ist
6983495 mit dieser regelung wird der rechtsschutz der betroffenen erheblich verbessert

6983497 what the fuck is a blogger is that something that sort of gets stuck on your behind and you cant shake it off
6983498 wir sollten aufh ren den eindruck zu erwecken dieser freiheitliche verfassungsstaat sei ein staat der seine b rger berwacht
6983499 wir haben den anspruch aus einer guten vorlage ein sehr gutes gesetz zu machen
6983500 grundrechte zu schleifen um die allumfassende berwachung der b rgerinnen und b rger zu gew hrleisten
6983501 sonst h tten wir auch aus dieser krise nichts gelernt

6983534 the experience in speaker idol competition at teched sea 2008 was great it reminds me of those debating competitions that i participated when i was in high school presentation skills are something that will go a long way in your career most people have no problems giving presentation but not many can see how well they are presenting speaker idol is a good testing ground for this with the 10 minutes time limit it requires you to focus on giving the most captivate presentation that is within the attention spans of most audiences most people tend to be long winded and afraid to miss out every single detail in the presentation this risks losing the audience attention before the core message is presented
6983535 i usually try to re title my posts from the originator but on this occasion i felt the title of a recent post had to stay
6983536 there is a whole load of commentary in robs post that is of course music to my ears and on apple in particular he was joined this week by a hard hitting post from michael arrington what really caught my eye in robs post was this part where he talks about microsoft equipt
6983537 the microsoft educational community has launched a new application on facebook called

6983543 it is difficult to overstate the role of the media as an effective and potent instrument in building and sustaining democracy and good governance
6983544 the delta state government has strategically designed the first information summit on media peace and development as building blocks for deepening democracy and good governance
6983545 the summit will serve as a forum for high level dialogue among senior government officials oil and gas top executives other business executives journalists media managers peace building and development practitioners through this forum the delta state government hopes to forge a strong and strategic partnership between it on the one hand development partners private sector actors organised civil society and the delta state diaspora on the other hand
6983546 we are strappingly condemning what massacre happened in bakara market they idiotically shelled civilians were shopping in the market and worshippers at a mosque especially abu hureyra mosque

6983551 theres an old myth that says that prostitutes wont kiss clients
6983552 we get a steady stream of people who were erroneously dropped

6983554 if we are made aware of an instance where medical debt was incurred or someone needs to see a doctor we work on a case by case basis to resolve those issues

6983566 the whole point is that 99 percent of the people who go to the festival want to go to have fun
6983567 the problem is that 1 percent who want to cause trouble
6983568 when you think about the amount of money that people put into paying for their costumes and the amount of work that goes into putting together this event it would be really pathetic to see even one person come out and do anything that will give a bad image to the carnival that we work so hard to put on

6983604 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6983605 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6983606 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6983607 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6983608 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6983609 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese

6983611 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6983612 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6983613 if you trust every web site but not a government
6983614 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6983615 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6983616 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6983617 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6983618 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including

6983635 dahulu orang orang berusaha melihat hilal kemudian aku kabarkan kepada rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam kalau aku benar benar telah melihatnya maka beliaupun berpuasa dan memerintahkan orang orang berpuasa sebagaimana beliau

6983643 manusia senantiasa berada dalam kebaikan selama mereka menyegerakan berbuka dan mengakhirkan santap sahur
6983644 apabila malam sudah datang dari arah sini barat dan apabila siang telah pergi ke arah situ timur maka orang yang berpuasa telah berbuka
6983645 barangsiapa yang terlupa dalam keadaan puasa kemudian dia makan atau minum hendaklah disempurnakan puasanya karena sesungguhnya alloh lah yang memberikan makan dan meminuminya
6983646 barangsiapa yang membatalkan puasa karena lupa maka tidak perlu qodho dan tidak perlu membayar kafaroh
6983647 aku telah berhubungan dengan isteriku padahal aku dalam keadaan berpuasa

6983657 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6983658 first such canned humor often disrupts the natural flow of conversation and jokes that fail to deliver humor are a violation of a social contract so punishing the teller can discourage similar behavior in the future

6983702 its too soon right now try again in 6 months
6983703 i still want you in my life im just not sure how
6983704 i dont want this to be awkward but i never want to have to see you again you have driven me into the arms of another and now i need you to step away from my life forever so that i can finally be rid of you and live a fulfilling happy life
6983705 penso a un paniere in cui dovrebbero esserci prezzi politici di riferimento per determinati prodotti
6983706 il mio modello illustra intervistato da libero prevede per esempio che i comuni oltre una certa dimensione potranno gestire i tributi stabiliti dallo stato o dalle regioni con una flessibilit che va da zero a 100 quel comune potr decidere se e come metterlo chi vive ad avellino potr confrontare cosa fa il comune di nembro provincia di bergamo e vedere se paga di pi o di meno e che servizi riceve in cambio
6983707 preferisco parlare di confronto il comune avr diritto di decidere deduzioni detrazioni ed esenzioni per esempio potra scegliere se mettere una tassa sul turismo o decidere di esentare gli alberghi per promuovere il settore
6983708 io penso a cose nuove se abbiamo 10 tasse vorrei raggrupparle facendone una sola facendo pagare di meno al contribuente per lo stato riscuotere una tassa di piccola entit costa di pi di quello che pensa di incassare meglio raggrupparle allora le tasse devono dipendere non dalla sede sociale di una societ ma da dove lazienda lavora veramente come nel caso delle aziende petrolifere che raffinano in sicilia o sardegna regioni che devono quindi beneficiare di quelle imposte
6983709 coppa italia calcio a la squalifica a tempo determinato deve essere scontata nellambito dellattivit ufficiale della societ con la quale risulta tesserato il calciatore
6983710 high taxes on a narrow base are about the opposite of optimal tax theory
6983711 and to go out here and learn this offense and get better and better and i dont think that changes no matter what they decide
6983712 because i think hes getting better and better right now he needs consistency and continuity which we all do and hes getting that right now hes getting a very detailed offense from a very detail oriented coach and i think he performs well in that environment
6983713 it doesnt feel good being sloppy on defense especially since we are one game away from clinching the division
6983714 we played flawless baseball before coming here we just need to check ourselves right now
6983715 we arent going to win many games with just four hits
6983716 it was an accomplishment to even be in the game as long as we were but you have to tip your hat to threets 3 5 because he pitched a great game
6983717 we need to get good at bats and have solid defense
6983718 in the racing industry things happen in days or weeks a month is a long time in wine everything is years these plants are 3 years old and the wine wont be bottled for 18 to 24 months thats been crazy to me but you cant rush wine
6983719 before i met him i already admired him as a driver now i admire him even more hes such a fierce competitor but also a really good person
6983720 hes had the wine bug for a long long time
6983721 everywhere weve been he loves working with the soil he approaches this like he does everything he always wants the best and he really does his homework
6983722 its a perfect racetrack wine good with food and barbecue and friends
6983723 one things for sure the wine always tastes sweetest in the winners circle
6983724 i know i should have made the catch but you know what like coach says it was one play so im looking forward to going in and getting some opportunities to get the ball in my hands and show what i can do thats all i can ask for
6983725 when you look at it guys drop that many passes in a game
6983726 my thing is i dont drop balls but ive got to get opportunities to make the plays i know how to make
6983727 i know we can run the football thats no secret
6983728 we were good last year i think well be better this year with improvements up front and the addition of darren mcfadden to come out and run the ball again and do it this game really isnt important because im not worried about that
6983729 i want to see how much we can do with our first unit throwing the ball so it will be a good test for us
6983730 its going to be a big game for him tonight its preseason but its the most important game the game being the third hell play a lot and hopefully well get him the ball a number of times and hell make some plays for us
6983731 really sac fans what do you really think he is going to do for this club
6983732 i just hope theyre patient with us first and foremost
6983733 its time to show what we can do because you dont know how long the opportunity is going to present itself
6983734 were going to try our best to make things happen
6983735 i enjoy watching the kids and i knew they were going to make mistakes
6983736 the coaching staff enjoys theres a lot more teaching going on thats why were here

6983740 weve migrated from there after we received threats bjp and sena activists armed with swords threatened us to leave the area or be ready to face consequences

6983748 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6983749 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6983750 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6983751 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6983752 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6983753 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6983754 i reject out of hand completely the idea that i should take into account cultural differences
6983755 this gentleman is not a predatory manipulative child sex abuser

6983758 today one of the most violent and prolific narcotics traffickers in the hemisphere has been extradited to the united states to be held accountable for his crimes
6983759 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6983760 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6983761 with which he needs to work closely on the war on terror in order to keep washington in the right humor
6983762 the logic will be that a powerful individual with national support which zardari might get will be more effective to deal with the question of terrorism

6983795 people sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs rather than as persons to be loved and cherished how easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality without regard for modesty self respect or the that bring quality to human relationships this is worship of a false god instead of bringing life it brings death
6983796 maybe immodestly dressed older women think that theyre beyond the age of posing a temptation and maybe they are
6983797 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians

6983844 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges

6983855 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq

6983857 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
6983858 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
6983859 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6983860 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6983861 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6983862 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6983863 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

6983943 hver gang har jeg f et at vide at nu bliver sagen lagt verst i bunken som borger har man for ldelsesfrister overholder man ikke dem har man ikke ret til noget den slags g lder benbart ikke for myndighederne
6983944 jeg har tabt en masse penge for jeg har ikke f lt at jeg kunne tillade mig at foretage n dvendige investeringer p en halv mio kr i produktionsfaciliteter jeg ved ikke om de kan tr kkes fra
6983945 vi er lige undervejs med at komme med et forslag
6983946 ive got no control over this disease and im bloody terrified i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world
6983947 but i have to be realistic and face the possibility that i might not live to see them grow up
6983948 i cant face telling my boys because they are so young they think mummy has a tummy ache
6983949 im sitting here desperately trying to come to terms with the fact that i might die while people are out there accusing me of making my illness up
6983950 call me a racist call me a bigot a chav whatever but dont call me a liar over this
6983951 when i was first told how serious my cancer was my first thought was for my boys
6983952 then when i was told i needed an urgent hysterectomy i broke down at the thought of never having more children i have always longed for a baby girl
6983953 then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
6983954 im tortured by the fact people think this is a stunt
6983955 since big brother my life has been fashioned by publicity but no way would i want anyone to be in my shoes now i have to try and brush that sort of stuff aside and concentrate on living and getting well again
6983956 she has serious second stage cancer and needs surgery as soon as possible the cancer is in an advanced stage and was diagnosed in the nick of time the bottom line is if shed stayed in india for the next three months she wouldnt be here
6983957 the atmosphere is febrile it really is a shocking embarrassing state of affairs this could be the beginning of the end for both sir ian and tarique
6983958 i hope she will get it in time to wear to the convention next week
6983959 the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
6983960 the big problem was keeping the markers in place the little ones kept on pulling them off with their trunks
6983961 i hope she will get it in time to wear to the convention next week
6983962 these people think youre stupid and if you vote them in again you will have proved it
6983963 in a land that theyve always subconsciously considered their own
6983964 the atmosphere is febrile it really is a shocking embarrassing state of affairs this could be the beginning of the end for both sir ian and tarique
6983965 the bullying and adversity made him be stronger and work harder
6983966 michael may not have been able to focus in school but i saw a passion for swimming at such a young age
6983967 he could be at a swim meet or practice for hours it was a great outlet
6983968 if you take the whole gamut of threats from state sponsored organisations to industrial espionage private individuals and malcontents youre talking about a remarkable number of attempted attacks on our system id say in the thousands
6983969 were building this house of cards at the moment connecting elements of our financial systems as well as the systems which control nuclear power or water distribution to the internet and its a very open environment
6983970 most companies are not aware of the threat and have an unreasonable faith in their own security systems
6983971 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never bony bony but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
6983972 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin
6983973 the arsenic concentrations reported are worrisome but the risk assessment is complex
6983974 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
6983975 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich
6983976 the idea is to grow one of these magic thicknesses at low temperature and then heat up the sample slowly to room temperature
6983977 this work represents a key step forward in producing a device to focus helium atoms
6983978 the remaining step is to combine the high reflectivity with a carefully deformed surface in order to create a focused atomic spot that is still quite a challenge
6983979 although the indians can fill the dam between june 21 and aug 31 they can only do so by releasing at least 55 000 cusecs downstream we made a call to the indian indus basin water treaty commissioner who promised to get back after checking the facts from irrigation authorities in occupied kashmir
6983980 but it certainly was a violation of the indus basin water treaty as pakistan had always feared when the indians were building the dam
6983981 inflow in the chenab river has gone down to 20 000 cusecs on friday against its historic low of 35 000 cusecs
6983982 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6983983 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6983984 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6983985 unfortunately at the moment there is no treatment that could be offered that would change the situation what it may prove to be is a very sensitive test of drug treatment response as new agents are developed
6983986 we are getting into a post antibiotic era with no new ammunition theres not going to be one magic bullet out there however doing something like this we are not speeding the process of antibiotic resistance too much
6983987 youre not wiping the other ones out youre having a softer evolutionary pressure against resistance
6983988 if were lucky and we have a breakthrough thatd be great id rather be conservative
6983989 not only can the remotely located patient consult a specialist the specialist too can instruct the patient for specific test procedures and treatment
6983990 i will ensure that any matters arising from the inquiry will be duly acted upon and will engage with state and territory governments in their areas of responsibility
6983991 the australian government needs to appoint some kind of investigation about all the children who came through this agency look at their background look into their documents these children are going to want to find their parents the communication is being lost
6983992 we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from the himal pahad terai and the madhes
6983993 there are high expectations from the public from the new government
6983994 he added rachanda who is also the chairman of the cpn maoists said that the new government will strengthen democracy
6983995 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
6983996 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
6983997 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labour and employers
6983998 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
6983999 kyle was one of those who graduated summa cum laude with honors
6984000 he ryan sat back and looked at me and said hell i dont want to know who you are talking to i have you here so my players dont have an excuse not to get help and in its simplicity we are still way behind
6984001 coach good to meet you my name is chris carr oh good to meet you he said you must be our new shrink i said no coach i am your new stretch
6984002 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6984003 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6984004 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6984005 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6984006 when such cases verbal abuse are reported we can only forward it to the education department for further action
6984007 however it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court
6984008 despite the reports the teachers who allegedly abused the indian students verbally and physically continue to teach and no apparent action has been taken against them
6984009 from the size of the preserved bones we estimated that omo i was tall and slender most likely around 510
6984010 taken together the remains show that these early modern humans were much like the people in southern ethiopia and the southern sudan today
6984011 most of the anatomical features of omo are like modern humans only a few features are similar to more primitive hominids including neanderthals and homo erectus
6984012 omo ii is more primitive in its cranial anatomy and shares more features with homo erectus and fewer with modern humans

6984017 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6984018 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere
6984019 i feel like i left some shots out there and didnt hit my irons well but at least i had some semblance of good putting something i havent done well for eight months
6984020 i know that i can still do it if i play up to my capabilities and that is what i strive for every time i play
6984021 it just seems like ive been hitting into the wind uphill all the time
6984022 when youre going well its like youre always hitting downhill with a tail wind i just want to be in contention with nine holes left on sunday
6984023 i like my game i like the way im playing
6984024 with a couple of exceptions today for not knowing the golf course i felt i did pretty well maneuvering my ball around and to maneuver your ball around a golf course you dont know you have to have control i felt like i did that pretty well
6984025 i hit the ball pretty straight today i had a lot of birdie putts

6984027 wrinkles are related to the need for these large animals to keep their body temperature down wrinkles increase the surface area so there is more skin to wet when the animal bathes all the cracks and crevices trap moisture which then takes much longer to evaporate
6984028 es war f r mich eine absolute inspiration die briten bei den olympischen spielen zu beobachten
6984029 dort siehst du leute die keine profis sind die alles geben und so hart trainieren wie sie nur k nnen
6984030 sie sind so hungrig auf den sieg ich bin einfach froh dass sie so gut abgeschnitten haben f r das land ist das gut
6984031 keiner von uns kann es sich nun leisten einen fehler zu machen auch wenn es dort drau en dazu raum genug gibt
6984032 es ist schwierig zu verstehen warum wir tausend leute brauchen um zwei autos einzusetzen
6984033 das sind zu viele wir machen nur rennsport man vergisst dar ber was die leute wollen ich sehe nicht viele leute die ein interesse f r unser getriebe haben oder f r fernando alonsos aufh ngung nur wenige flippen aus wenn sie an fernandos bremsen denken
6984034 die fragen immer das gleiche aber die welt hat sich ver ndert
6984035 wir sind auch in der unterhaltungsindustrie nicht nur im maschinenbau das geld kommt aus dem marketing es geht nicht darum aufh ngungen oder getriebe zu verkaufen oder gar gebrauchtwagen wir sind keine autoh ndler
6984036 bob an einem neuen grand prix schauplatz muss die erste frage lauten wie bewerten sie den ersten tag in valencia
6984037 es lief ziemlich gut wir konnten mit beiden autos zusammen mehr als 100 runden fahren was ich f r eine gute distanz an einem freitag halte ich glaube alle teams waren berrascht dass das gripniveau sogar noch viel schlechter war als erwartet daraus ergibt sich dass die rundenzeiten momentan etwas ber unseren vorhersagen aus den simulationen liegen
6984038 aber die strecke baut jetzt kontinuierlich eine gummiauflage auf unsere fahrer sind mit dem kurs schnell gut zurechtgekommen und fanden bereits eine brauchbare balance wir haben auch schon viel ber das verhalten der reifen an diesem rennwochenende gelernt
6984039 viele fahrer sprachen davon dass es ziemlich knifflig w re die optimalen bremspunkte zu erwischen
6984040 das stimmt der valencia street circuit ist in dieser hinsicht extrem schwierig man kann sie mit montr al vergleichen die anspruchsvollste strecke f r die bremsen berhaupt
6984041 kann ein team bei der heutigen simulationstechnik auf einer neuen strecke eigentlich noch mit einem v llig falschen setup beginnen
6984042 das halte ich f r ausgeschlossen das einzige was die simulationen nicht mit einberechnen k nnen ist die exakte linie die die fahrer w hlen aber davon abgesehen kennen wir den gro teil der abstimmungsdaten bevor das auto auch nur einen meter auf einem neuen kurs gefahren ist an der rennstrecke dreht sich die arbeit nur noch um das optimieren dieser einstellungen
6984043 die formel 1 geht bald ins letzte saisondrittel welche ziele hat sich renault f r den endspurt gesetzt
6984044 unser ziel ist klar wir wollen platz vier in der konstrukteurs weltmeisterschaft erreichen und in allen kommenden rennen das drittschnellste auto stellen keine unm gliche zielsetzung
6984045 man sieht dass der renault r28 seit saisonbeginn erheblich weiterentwickelt wurde
6984046 dieses auto verbesserte sich von 1 2 sekunden r ckstand auf nur noch 0 5 sekunden zeitverlust auf die spitze und wir haben es geschafft das fahrverhalten w hrend des rennens zu stabilisieren der wagen weist keinen grundlegenden fehler auf ihm fehlt blo noch ein bisschen aerodynamische effizienz aber wir arbeiten auch auf diesem gebiet intensiv weiter
6984047 wie viel eurer kapazit ten widmet ihr denn der entwicklung des aktuellen autos manche teams arbeiten schon zu 100 prozent an ihren 2009er rennwagen
6984048 ich w rde sagen wir arbeiten zu 30 prozent f r 2008 und 70 prozent f r die kommende saison in den n chsten wochen wird sich dieses verh ltnis weiter zugunsten des n chstj hrigen autos verschieben die formel 1 steht niemals still
6984049 ihr geht also einen anderen weg als 2004 als fr h entschieden wurde alle kr fte auf das neue auto zu konzentrieren um zum start der ge nderten aerodynamikregeln gleich vorn dabei zu sein
6984050 die situation war eine v llig andere erstens steckten im 2004er auto einige gr ere probleme die sich nicht ohne grundlegende umbauten h tten l sen lassen zweitens waren wir ein viel j ngeres team und konnten uns so eine entscheidung erlauben und drittens lie en sich sogar einige der erkenntnisse am 2005er auto aus dem windkanal auf den aktuellen wagen bertragen das w re heute unm glich weil die regeln f r 2009 radikal andere autos erfordern zwischen dem diesj hrigen und dem n chstj hrigen auto ist kein austausch denkbar
6984051 neben dem wunsch vierter der hersteller wm zu werden spielen da auch strategische berlegungen mit etwa der wunsch fernando etwas zu beweisen oder den sponsoren
6984052 indem wir zeigen dass wir uns aus einer schwierigen lage zur ckmelden k nnen steigt nat rlich fernandos vertrauen in unsere f higkeiten und auch das unserer partner auch wenn wir ende 2008 ein schnelles auto haben werden bedeutet das noch nicht dass unser 2009er renner ein erfolg wird
6984053 aber darauf kommt es nach meiner ansicht auch nicht an sondern darauf dass das gesamte team selbstvertrauen gewinnt wenn wir gesteckte ziele erreichen das wird uns f r kommende saison st rker machen
6984054 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6984055 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6984056 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6984057 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6984058 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6984059 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6984060 es war notwendig den spielern eine pause zu geben wir hatten sorge dass sie einen hitzeschlag oder andere probleme bekommen k nnten

6984063 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas
6984064 i have asked my department to make direct contact with the indian authorities and provide me with a brief on any potential legal issues arising in india and australia
6984065 i will ensure that any matters arising are duly acted upon by my department and where relevant are passed on for states and territories to implement
6984066 the department advises me that theyve done a very thorough investigation into those 23 cases from india and that there is currently only one case that they are continuing to investigate
6984067 i have since also asked for another in depth audit of all of those 23 cases involved
6984068 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6984069 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6984070 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6984071 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6984072 its literally silly for some of them to sit around in sacramento
6984073 its poor judgment on their part and only fuels the fire of the publics animus toward the legislature
6984074 i dont know who is going to the convention from my caucus
6984075 what i do know is that our no 1 priority is to settle the budget and none of us would sacrifice that to go to a convention
6984076 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
6984077 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond
6984078 when i came back they put up a banner in the post office near here saying miss gerts back
6984079 the answer to our prayers brad pitt and angelina jolie
6984080 if you didnt know you couldnt hit what was needed you shouldnt have taken the assignment
6984081 the office manager asked me directly if i sent you out to appraise a million dollar home and the comps comparable values only came in at 800 000 but in your heart you knew it was worth a million dollars what would you bring it in at
6984082 the market is full of million dollar houses selling for 750 000 why should i be responsible for adding one more foreclosed property to the already growing list
6984083 you bet it was it was just a little subtler a little less direct than it used to be
6984084 is really to find out will this guy play ball will he be cooperative when we need him
6984085 sales volumes are down and some lenders know that theyll eventually find someone wholl cooperate
6984086 its not easy for some of them to say no especially when they see business go to folks who everybody knows are playing the game
6984087 up until eight years ago or so seward park was pretty much a secret but more people realize the value of the neighborhood now
6984088 many people choose the neighborhood for its cultural diversity and some buyers avoid it for the same reason
6984089 ive lived a lot of different places but this neighborhood urban with a lot of open spaces feels the most like portland where i grew up
6984090 and i like the diversity when im in other neighborhoods i notice how homogeneous they are
6984091 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
6984092 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
6984093 i would have had no other way to purchase a home and invest in my future without the nehemiah program
6984094 it would have taken years for me to save enough
6984095 i am going nuts because i think there is such a lack of knowledge about this program and now we have an elimination date of oct 1
6984096 before this program gets slammed shut we could help a lot of people get into homes and get some much needed market activity going
6984097 the higher foreclosure rates represent a financial burden for fha and taxpayers
6984098 but of greater concern they hurt the families who lose their homes and the neighborhoods in which those homes are located
6984099 all of them still own their homes are making their mortgage payments on time and are now turning their past rent dollars into future equity
6984100 im finding these homes are attracting a lot of first time buyers
6984101 in a case that im working with now the buyers have the income and wherewithal to make payments but trying to come up with the necessary down payment is a struggle especially with home prices the way they are now
6984102 barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs but they cant do it alone show your support for the obama biden ticket by making a donation today
6984103 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
6984104 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6984105 he hasnt demonstrated it yet this is early in the campaign
6984106 probably the most under qualified person since george bush to seek the presidency
6984107 i think the kind of routine im going to have is actually in place
6984108 i mean i dont think its going to vary too much from this
6984109 the weather is going to be a little warm here tonight and little warm sunday im not opposed to using him in the outfield i think hes played some pretty good defense for us too
6984110 were not confused regarding how well use him its been primarily against the lefties but id like to get him more at bats because i know he could also hit against the righties if that were to come up historically he might have been better against the righties than the lefties but for now were going to stay with the platoon situation get him out there against the lefty
6984111 its not like i keep secrets from him or he keeps secrets from me about whats going on
6984112 we talk all the time about everything like i talk to andrew friedman rays executive vice president of baseball operations we talk to the trainers you know its a collaborative thing when i feel good ill be out there
6984113 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6984114 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6984115 in the old days they just gave you a plaque
6984116 now chinese gold medalists walk away with more than many athletes in developed countries
6984117 when i am in desperation i dont make good choices
6984118 this could be a 40th birthday present to yourself to say im financially sound
6984119 we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
6984120 the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6984121 is going to come down in coming months pretty rapidly
6984122 heroes and warriors heed my call it s been merely a week since father had been slain and up until now i am deeply troubled by his loss i know there are those who remain loyal to my father and to our clan thus i summon for all brave souls who wish to join me in my quest to regain the honor that my clan rightfully deserves once i have created an army strong enough to join my cause i assure you we will take the heat of the battle to our enemies and win this war
6984123 we still go back into the books and look at all the things they accomplished
6984124 now we have the title of worlds greatest athlete back on u s soil i know that means something to all the guys who went before us
6984125 being physically exhausted after the first day knowing i was coming out here with only four hours sleep it was tough

6984128 my main goal here was to win the gold medal
6984129 i come out there and perform and let the public enjoy themselves i wont change i will always be myself
6984130 im in favour of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
6984131 they the milf must show good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating and that good faith is to surrender the two who perpetrated these atrocities and stop condoning it at least if not encouraging
6984132 we are pragmatic enough to realise that we dont know who is sincere and who is not and so we shall give them that option through dialogue however if they refuse to heed that call and seek another path we shall be ready to take appropriate action
6984133 i think it is prudent for us to assume the worst but hope for the best

6984161 kau harusnya berterimakasih pada tuan lucifer ini karena berkat aku kau tidak jadi dihabisi oleh iblis level rendahan itu tahu tidak
6984162 sayang sekali sudah sekian tahun sejak kau dan temanmu mengurung aku dalam tubuh anak ini
6984163 kau tahu 10 000 tahun di neraka tak sebanding dengan penderitaan yang harus kurasakan saat berada dalam tubuh anak ini
6984164 kau harusnya mengerti ling ada saatnya kesabaranku habis kau sudah membuatku menderita dan sekaranglah saatnya aku membalas tubuh lemah ini akan kuganti dengan tubuh asliku dan saat aku menemukannya kau akan tamat
6984165 kau pikir aku tidak mengantisipasi jika suatu saat ada keadaan seperti ini
6984166 kau sungguh pintar ling yao kau telah memenangkan perdebatan ini aku takkan membunuhmu sampai aku tahu dimana tubuh asliku ha ha ha
6984167 tapi aku takkan berbelas kasihan pada makhluk rendahan yang disana
6984168 kau yang ada disana menyerahlah angkat tanganmu dan berbaring di tanah
6984169 lihatlah bagaimana makhluk itu mengamuk tragis bukan jika orang yang kita sayangi berubah menjadi makhluk yang menyedihkan seperti yang sedang kau lihat ini
6984170 itu bukan salahku lho mamamu memang sudah menjadi makhluk itu itu sudah hukum kematian
6984171 kaulah yang membunuh kedua orangtuaku tapi kenapa kau datang mencariku

6984174 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6984175 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6984176 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6984177 such knowledge centralisation not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts

6984181 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6984182 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6984183 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6984184 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6984185 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6984186 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6984187 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6984188 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6984190 we are hopeful that there would be very little change with regard to the zimbabwe issue even though we are aware of the fact that no two people can be the same
6984191 in its eagerness to address many of the problems confronting the country the khama administration has been rattling initiatives at dizzying speed some of the recent initiatives could easily bankrupt the country scare investors and most importantly ruin our democracy
6984192 the president due to his popularity has become an institution within the state he has become too powerful
6984193 he is an imperial president chief of a powerful ethnic group and son of the countrys first president he is therefore more powerful than he can conjure
6984194 if khama was a democrat he would know that there are structures in the country which together with the president makes laws and policies governing the country
6984195 now that the ruling bdp botswana democratic party backbench has been put on silent mode the next target is the media
6984196 perhaps burdened by his fathers legacy khama loves to deliver as much if not more than the first president
6984197 i ask the nepalese army police armed police and the national investigation department to forget the bitter past born out of the conflict and urge them to forge national unity and move ahead
6984198 i assure them that there will be no prejudices or bias against them
6984199 the new governments main responsibility is to complete the peace process and draft a new constitution within the next two years
6984200 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socioeconomic issues such as poverty unemployment and other problems and we will work to bring about a modern industrial economy for which a private public partnership model will be followed

6984203 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea

6984207 extensive inquiries among the residents about their wishes concerning resuscitation
6984208 we have tried to start a debate about this issue very cautiously
6984209 if a patient does not want to be resuscitated it is his right
6984210 extensive scientific research has not proven any correlation between age and the quality of life following resuscitation
6984211 these people certainly do not get into a vegetative state quite the contrary
6984212 more than 77 per cent of the people conducted independent lives 85 per cent was physically independent and 84 per cent was cognitively independent

6984219 to help kick our countrys dependence on foreign oil we need to be doing a better job harnessing our solar wind and ocean energy
6984220 these are natural resources that are abundant in maine it is exciting and encouraging to me that we will be hosting some of the most forward thinking individuals on ocean energy in our state next summer i hope that we can use this opportunity to learn from each other and see real progress with respect to ocean energy in maine in the near future
6984221 we tend to think that we know what landscape photography is as a category we call it documentary photography but there is a long tradition that escapes that simple definition this presentation will look at new approaches within several directions the illusion of perfection intervention in the terrain and what might be thought of as agitprop or politically motivated works

6984225 defensively we gave up some big plays and we would hope that thats not customary for us
6984226 the second was probably more disappointing because it was just a straight return
6984227 we didnt get our first hit on him until he was at the 30 yard line
6984228 i like there to be a commander in chief on the field on a particular side of the ball
6984229 oh he killed himself so hell be a worm next time well too bad he was going to be the antichrist
6984230 j t will be our starter going into the season
6984231 hes got very good command of the offense and played well in all three preseason games but now its time to get ready for the season
6984232 the perception will be wrong if that is the perception
6984233 because i think he is getting better and better right now
6984234 i dont see it as a problem we want to play our best players alex has a lot of ability and a lot of potential and hes going to be a good quarterback in this league hes just not there at this point
6984235 this has not been a case of shaun and alex not performing well
6984236 this has been a case of j t performing well
6984237 in fairness to john and jed scot and i kept them apprised

6984249 well you know i went to that little store off hilcroft in the shopping center
6984250 russian grocery store have i told you about this place
6984251 yeah yeah you know that place then i found some great stuff there today
6984252 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
6984253 i dont know what hes packing balls or vajayjay but hes got to work it out
6984254 which team would you pick to design an outfit for you
6984255 it took me back to the first professional fight i had when the same thing happened to me
6984256 i gassed in two minutes of the first round and then it just clicks over to pure survival mode at that point and you just want to finish it and get the fight over with so you can get the heck out of there
6984257 it was going back and forth at a pretty good pace in the first round but i knew right away that i was in trouble because i wasnt recovering at all from those flurries
6984258 in the room that i train in im able to recover within a few seconds of flurrying like that and it just wasnt happening out there i knew it was gonna be an ugly fight in terms of just being gassed then the second round started i made some poor decisions and took a terrible shot and actually smacked my head real good into the mat and knocked myself loopy
6984259 im never gonna accept a loss and honestly its super frustrating for me because there was nothing about matt hamill that bothered me going in
6984260 if he would have come in and just stomped me outright thats one thing and i can say that i have to go back to the drawing board and work on some things but in this case with a factor like the altitude and me gassing because of that i think i was even more frustrated that i lost that fight so ive been working my cardio hard and thats a situation i never want to put myself in again
6984261 i thought if i got myself in good enough shape that the altitude wasnt gonna be a factor and i got out there a couple days ahead of when the ufc was gonna send me so i had a full week which i thought was gonna be enough
6984262 but as it turns out in talking to people it really takes almost three weeks or a month of training in that to really let your body adapt
6984263 it definitely didnt make me question myself as a fighter
6984264 i didnt take a step back and say am i doing the right thing with my life here i definitely know what im capable of doing and losing to matt hamill didnt make me question myself as a fighter at all so being able to look at that and say yeah i gassed because i was 5 000 feet above where i normally train at does help me in rationalizing things but i hate to lose i hate to lose a game of checkers let alone a fight on national tv
6984265 drysdale blows my mind with what he can do with grappling and jiu jitsu to know that there are people out there like that just boggles my mind it opened my eyes to what i need to be training towards and what people can actually do with themselves when they devote themselves to a sport
6984266 i need as much learning experience as i can get
6984267 someone asked me the other day how much of my potential i think ive used up already and honestly im a baby in the sport i havent even been doing mixed martial arts two years so im real green still and i have a lot to learn
6984268 im a pretty humble guy and i try and keep grounded but after the heath fight there was definitely a lot of attention from the fans and the media about a billion interviews a week and that sort of thing
6984269 but my family helps keep me grounded and its not really in my personality to get too big of a head on my shoulders i just like to go in there and perform and with my style of fighting i like to mix it up and keep it exciting so for the fans to want to see me fight that just motivates me more to go in there and perform for them
6984270 people say that if youre doing what you love you never have to work a day in your life and honestly thats how i feel
6984271 i love the training i love to compete and in this sport every days a competition in the training room but fighting full time is definitely surreal a lot of people ask me how i get up knowing that every day youve got to fight and train and put yourself through it well in this sport youve got to be a little wacky because i look forward to that every day i love it

6984274 i dont want to put any of you on the spot but you guys here with the suits and ties whats going on are you super fans
6984275 im used to a lot of insecurity lets get her back in here
6984276 what happened to you whered you go whatd you do
6984277 you came all the way from orange county to see me well thats far i came all the way from missouri his previous nights stop to see you im glad youre back im going to play you a song for your efforts i appreciate it
6984278 i just didnt want anyone to think i wouldnt address the past its important for our evolution
6984279 i was tired i tried hard but i was struggling at times
6984280 youve got to expect it even though i would have liked to have done better a couple of things didnt quite go my way and that happens when youre not quite on top of your game
6984281 you get slightly out with your clubbing and there were a couple of bad three putts but at the end of the day i would definitely put it down to mental tardiness rather than anything else
6984282 you never like missing cuts you dont want to do that
6984283 but it is really a knock on from the last couple of weeks and i think id rather take two wins and a missed cut
6984284 theres no doubt that a couple of days rest will do me more good than playing a couple more rounds here at the back of the field thats for sure
6984285 and its a long week next week so im sort of happy to have the break
6984286 hopefully ill come out stronger next week there was always going to be a little bit of a fall off when you do things like that but i struggled and so i was a little bit disappointed in the end
6984287 if i can help warrington do well in the play offs and hopefully get us to the grand final then it would be a good finish to the season for me
6984288 i am looking to go out on a high this season its been a major disappointment so far there is nothing worse than sitting on the sidelines watching the lads because you want to honour your contract
6984289 i think we have definitely got a chance of causing some damage in the play offs but we have to get past castleford first
6984290 it was a bad night but its all behind us and it hasnt been mentioned in the build up
6984291 we just see it as another game we have to win to cement fourth spot in the league
6984292 its been a long road to recovery but the shoulder is as strong as its going to be ive done every exercise in the book and touch wood its feeling really good
6984293 i thought it would be 12 to 14 weeks but ive missed 22 games so far this year ive been out longer than first anticipated but we erred on the side of caution and made sure it was absolutely spot on
6984294 they had to hold me back but i appreciate that now
6984295 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6984296 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6984297 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6984298 most incidents are preventable and most have little to do with the work done in the laboratory however because of the importance placed on accurate test results those who work in the laboratory bear the ultimate responsibility for patient safety and should therefore follow established best practices
6984299 without proper laboratorian training the likelihood of erroneous laboratory test results increases substantially
6984300 the versatility of mentoring makes it useful in developing the clinical lab of the future
6984301 the mentor protege relationship has particular applicability in the clinical lab because lab professionals must learn to update their knowledge and skills rapidly to adapt to healthcare changes
6984302 laboratories need to have well established relationships and processes to ensure rapid detection and to provide timely and accurate information
6984303 in addition to department stores and retail outlets car distributors banking and insurance institutions as well as telecommunications service providers will also be taking part and offering discount prices and attractive deals

6984328 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6984329 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6984330 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6984331 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6984332 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6984333 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6984334 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6984335 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6984336 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6984337 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6984338 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6984339 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet

6984344 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample

6984347 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6984348 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6984349 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6984350 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6984351 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6984352 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6984353 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6984354 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6984355 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6984356 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6984357 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6984358 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6984359 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6984360 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6984361 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6984362 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6984363 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

6984367 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6984368 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6984369 she threw her nigga out the house yeah jazzy jeffd the nigga
6984370 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6984371 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6984372 agony of military defeat or the humiliation of life under israeli occupation
6984373 said that what converted him from dreamer to murderous activist was israeli bombs falling on beirut in 1982
6984374 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6984375 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6984376 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6984377 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6984378 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6984379 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6984380 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
6984381 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
6984382 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
6984383 betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
6984384 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
6984385 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
6984386 every seat will be a great seat as we listen to barack obama communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the challenges americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
6984387 the tatas will be accorded red carpet welcome to set up the project in maharashtra and will be given land and necessary facilities
6984388 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6984389 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6984390 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6984391 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6984392 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6984393 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6984394 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6984395 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6984396 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6984397 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6984398 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6984399 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6984400 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6984401 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6984402 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6984403 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6984404 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6984405 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6984406 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6984407 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6984408 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6984409 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6984410 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6984411 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6984412 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6984413 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6984414 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6984415 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6984416 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6984417 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6984418 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6984419 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6984420 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6984421 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6984422 clearly colorado voters are not jumping up and down about the dnc being held in denver
6984423 theres two camps in hillary land theres the peacemakers and the pumas party unity my aunt fannie
6984424 theyre still not behind obama some of them are stirring up a lot of trouble i dont like it im a peace maker this story empowers the puma crowd because they see this and i do too as sort of disrespecting senator clinton and breaking senator obamas word
6984425 i think we suffered a big blow today to the hard liners
6984426 i dont think hes spoken to senator clinton about the vice presidency or even sought her council
6984427 we may be surprised if he picks her but after that it was pretty clear that not only were they not interested in had having her they were not interested in her opinion
6984428 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6984429 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6984430 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6984431 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6984432 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6984433 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6984434 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6984435 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6984436 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6984437 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6984438 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6984439 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6984440 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6984441 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6984442 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6984443 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6984444 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6984445 when i did got ahead in the first two innings i made mistakes up in the zone and they dont miss those
6984446 i wish i could put together a couple of good games in a row i want to keep working and be consistent
6984447 it sounds ridiculous to say one little thing made the difference but it did
6984448 i can do more with my curveball i can spot my changeup on both sides of the plate and my fastball has a little more velocity my fastball in particular isnt dipping down to 85 86 mph like it did its just been staying consistent from 88 92
6984449 its kind of like an opening day feeling but im excited its a new experience for me
6984450 ill be smart about it i want to play the last month but well see
6984451 the biggest difference is the amount of fastballs we do not see as hitters
6984452 we have struck out a ton as hitters our pitching is more powerful than any other teams we got about five guys that can sit around 95 and just blow the other teams away thats whats been keeping us in ball games this is by far a pitchers league you have to manufacture runs as they come and just try to hold on to a lead

6984455 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6984456 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6984457 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6984458 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6984459 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6984460 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6984461 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6984462 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6984463 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6984464 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6984465 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6984466 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6984467 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6984468 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6984469 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6984470 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6984471 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6984472 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6984473 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6984474 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6984475 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6984476 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6984477 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6984478 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6984479 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6984480 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6984481 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6984482 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6984483 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6984484 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6984485 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6984486 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6984487 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6984488 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6984489 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6984490 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6984491 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6984492 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6984493 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6984494 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6984495 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6984496 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6984497 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6984498 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6984499 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6984500 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6984501 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6984502 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6984503 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6984504 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6984505 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6984506 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6984507 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6984508 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6984509 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6984510 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6984511 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6984512 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6984513 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6984514 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6984515 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6984516 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6984517 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6984518 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6984519 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6984520 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6984521 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6984522 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6984523 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6984524 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6984525 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6984526 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6984527 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6984528 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6984529 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6984530 such knowledge centralisation not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6984531 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6984532 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6984533 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6984534 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6984535 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6984536 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6984537 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6984538 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6984539 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6984540 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6984541 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6984542 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6984543 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6984544 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6984545 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6984546 ors exercised great control over the content of the show up to and including having ones advertis transportation businesses deliver goods and individuals from location to location generating a prof g firms report projected worldwide advertisement spending to exceed half a trillion dollars by 2010 y to day operational activities such as scheduling criteria
6984547 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6984548 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6984549 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6984550 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6984551 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6984552 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6984553 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6984554 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6984555 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6984556 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6984557 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6984558 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6984559 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6984560 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6984561 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6984562 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6984563 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6984564 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6984565 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6984566 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6984567 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6984568 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6984569 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6984570 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6984571 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6984572 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6984573 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

6984575 one of the highest priced sold items was an autographed olympic speedo swim cap from a special appearance he did in baltimore in 2004 it sold for 645
6984576 since hercules is the greek ideal for strength and courage and was said to have founded the olympic games to honour zeus phelpsean was a no brainer
6984577 do i think phelpsean com will fetch 1 million i think its worth far more than 1 million to someone out there
6984578 as far as the url in question it is not in violation of our policies however it is certainly a very steep price for someone to potentially pay
6984579 these were obtained by a source close to the players while they were in vegas practising
6984580 more time should be given to guarantee that all the bidders can provide the air force with the best options possible
6984581 given the delays already caused by the air forces own flawed selection process the request for additional time to prepare a proposal based on a different aircraft is entirely reasonable and it should be granted
6984582 these planes will be in the fleet for 40 to 60 years and its more important to make the right decision
6984583 this is a 40 billion contract to design and build the backbone of our nations military might and the requirements have changed overnight
6984584 providing only 60 days for a major design overhaul not only skews the competition toward airbus but also breaks the promise of a fair competition for our military and taxpayers
6984585 i walked into a house that had the worst colors i have ever seen
6984586 the walls were olive green and red a bedroom was painted chocolate brown
6984587 i buy piece by piece because i do not want the house to look like a showroom
6984588 i love to cook and my next big project will be to update the kitchen with granite countertops
6984589 i love that this house is an ongoing work in progress
6984590 we do get a fair amount of business from guys who said i did my deck once and i am never going to do that again
6984591 i tell my crew plastic is cheap but replacing siding is expensive
6984592 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
6984593 big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me
6984594 all this coaxing this being coy and planning to the nth degree is going to invite the most detailed critical scrutiny that youve ever seen
6984595 in spite of the fact that the rumored choices are all wonderful people none of them is jesus and none of them is moses even their friends can point out shortcomings
6984596 before we go any further id like to show you all a game i made up this game is called sounds of the studio and it can be played with any record including this one you may be surprised now if you have a pair of headphones you better get em out and get em cranked up cause theyre really gonna help you
6984597 yes of course projects dominated by one company are still open source and no it doesnt need to be organic
6984598 there exist counterexamples to this but in general great things are accomplished by small groups of people who are driven who have unity of purpose the more people involved the slower and stupider their union is
6984599 his assessment is brutally frank probably too brutal but any of us who do a similar job would be lying if we said we had no idea what hes talking about
6984600 grown often uncontrollably beyond the original design and is in desperate need of refactoring redesign redevelopment
6984601 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
6984602 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6984603 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6984604 there is no consolation if i keep blowing ball games
6984605 i have to get something right and go out and do my job thats the most frustrating thing if i could put my finger on something i could go out there and fix it but right now i am at a loss
6984606 it was a slider rauch has a really good slider
6984607 in that situation i was just trying to get the bat on the ball because i have had some problems with him in the past
6984608 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6984609 you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
6984610 i think that the only reason clarence thomas is on the court is because he is black i dont believe he could have won had he been white

6984614 its so good when its so good if this is so good then its no good
6984615 trinity said they want to make me an honorary patron of the philosophical society
6984616 i thought well theyve already given the james joyce award to will so this is the booby prize that they have left then it turns out it was a whole other college
6984617 ive heard this but im not saying it that the thing youre getting is not that great
6984618 it aint james joyce maybe i can get them to change the name to the samuel beckett award
6984619 which was a good post on a topic ive been thinking a lot about myself
6984620 joe biden is the only one with the experience and the plan to end this war responsibly so our children dont have to go back
6984621 the united states should actively support a political settlement in iraq based on the final provisions of the constitution that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions consistent with the wishes of the iraqi people and their leaders
6984622 to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
6984623 partition may end up being the best solution but heres the thing we cant impose it on the iraqis the iraqis have to make the decision themselves if the iraqi government believes that it can form a unified government they should do that if they want a soft partition they should do that if they want us simply to leave we can do that too but they have to make a series of decisions
6984624 why should it be a negative factor that obamas choice is not in lock step agreement
6984625 by what right does the u s or any other country have the right to partition another country
6984626 i think we would be better off minding our own business instead of toppling regimes and supporting tyrants which brought us 9 11
6984627 we should pay them war crimes reperations and help them rebuild their lives again
6984628 ancient people of iraq show the us government how they will put their war raveged nation back on track withing a year or two
6984629 pass all those tests in terms of my not having skeletons
6984630 if you cant look me in the eye and tell me that then dont put me through the audition
6984631 youd have to say yes i dont know how the hell youd say no at this historic moment
6984632 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6984633 this is a very special guy this is like catching lightning in a jar that was the point of everything i was saying
6984634 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6984635 ive initiated more change than all the democratic candidates combined

6984650 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6984651 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
6984652 a very open mind to learning hes very intelligent and thats one thing thats rarely talked about with pass rushers in this league
6984653 theres so much that goes into it and lawrence has that i think that philosophy if you will
6984654 if you cant think if youre just tall fast strong youre not going to get to the quarterback
6984655 youve got to start thinking about the 14th and 15th move on the chess board
6984656 and trying to set yourself up for a time when you really need to get a great play
6984657 my conditioning is pretty good i was at 262 when we went to the nba finals in 1996
6984658 i want to go over there and see how good i am because i dont want to come back to the nba and sit on somebodys bench i want the respect i want a chance to play and i dont know if ill get that chance in the nba i may stay over there in italy greece or russia playing for the next three or four years
6984659 i look back on it now and go wow what a privilege
6984660 i was so hurt and sad when they left but look theres something else out there its something new seattle can come out and watch its not the nba but itll be fun
6984661 were not looking to compete with the nba and ncaa were looking to complement
6984662 we can be a very complementary franchise anchor model to a wnba squad
6984663 the last time i saw shawn play was on my dvr and he was awesome too
6984664 it was an honor for us for him to even be here but i wouldnt do this this is stupid its too fast the guys jump too high and they have too much fun
6984665 if i go out there and have confidence im going to get guys out its going to happen for me
6984666 the only thing i can think of is the infrequency that the hitters face us
6984667 i mean there arent that many of us around the game so if you see us less often you have less time to get used to us
6984668 i had no idea being left handed in baseball was such a big deal until i got over here
6984669 i thought greenie was a little upset that i took him out of the game
6984670 i told him this is not the time to be upset with me
6984671 look to it that makes things easy to navigate and clean
6984672 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
6984673 you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6984674 there are no feelings of dizziness or loopiness anything like that
6984675 i will be taking it easy but am also excited to start writing for the fifth album
6984676 so what have you been doing the last four years
6984677 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6984678 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6984679 people have to look at this for what it is a disturbance between two individuals
6984680 obviously these kinds of things shouldnt happen but they happen on a regular basis and it shouldnt be made more than what it is
6984681 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
6984682 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen magic johnson that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl
6984683 so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible
6984684 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues arent allowed to come
6984685 i would like to be optimistic and hope that in 2016 we will have a chance again
6984686 it maybe carries a little more responsibility to really show how important baseball is not only to america but also to the netherlands to cuba
6984687 so what have you been doing the last four years
6984688 while companies have an important role to play we also believe the us government has the most significant leverage through diplomatic avenues on global issues of human rights
6984689 trade is one of many tools the government has in its toolbox to help effect change on these important international issues
6984690 ideas and intellectual content those are some of our greatest industries and we allow china to sell all sorts of things over here
6984691 a case primarily focused on chinas content review would be extremely unlikely to succeed at the wto as a general matter ustr looks very closely at the merits of any potential wto case and is extremely resistant to moving forward without a strong legal basis
6984692 attempts to address other kinds of political issues would put additional strain on the wto at a time when its legitimacy has been weakened by the collapse of the doha round and could threaten to undermine its ability to enforce trade rules
6984693 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
6984694 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
6984695 i go in once a day and pray for him
6984696 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
6984697 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him
6984698 we dont mind if they share it with us we just dont want them to take it all

6984709 an australian researcher has won an international prize for her plan to wrap a giant asteroid with reflective sheeting to stop it colliding with the earth and destroying all life
6984710 i guess we are not surprised but we wouldnt have been surprised the other way
6984711 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6984712 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6984713 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6984714 once people dont trust a police officer in immigrant communities they become communities that foster crime where people wont report domestic violence or the theft of a tv if people feel they are under threat of being deported they become silent there has to be a delicate balance
6984715 your wife runs a red light on her way to the store
6984716 there is a moral issue here we are here to provide not only law enforcement but justice
6984717 some people talk of fears of terrorizing immigrant communities but if youre not involved in criminal activity youll probably never come in contact with these programs
6984718 the media make it seem like if you are out mowing your grass well snatch you from your yard and arrest and deport you that is just not the case

6984723 caravaggio was a brilliant mischievous choice because there had long been speculation in art circles that vermeer had studied caravaggios work and been much influenced by it
6984724 the forger needs to anticipate the connoisseurs expectations and build in precisely those touches that will move the expert to say just as i figured
6984725 these comments are in keeping with dolnicks vision of art experts as practically begging to be fooled
6984726 caravaggio was known to have exerted a strong influence over dutch painters
6984727 by imitating the sense of suspended action that pervades vermeers paintings as opposed to caravaggios flamboyantly theatricality van meegeren gave the supper at emmaus a crucial measure of credibility as an example of the masters missing biblical period
6984728 seems to lift its composition almost literally from a well known 1940 painting by the nazi artist hans schachinger
6984729 exerted a strong subliminal attraction on viewers steeped in the visual culture of the day
6984730 faced with the hideous prospect of dutch masterpieces falling into german hands hollands art establishment and its great industrialists flung money at the sellers

6984733 and the mind resists this improbable fact which may seem even more remote on a night when the rain jets down in little stabs of ice so a man may have a hot center and never know it or learn only at a certain passage in his life mccord was crying with convulsive force holding both hands over his face and moving with irregular bends of which he was unaware what he felt was a liquid heat where his hands pressed against his face and a burning and swelling around his eyes as every person does who cries he learned there was some power that could take control of him but he didnt learn what it was
6984734 some of them continued to shop wondering if the lights were going to come back on
6984735 wouldnt have happened if the mall had had the water marked properly
6984736 every friday and saturday are big but its a big weekend for back to school we were very busy when the power went out

6984738 solar innovations thermally enhanced aluminum structures are built to withstand the high moisture atmosphere of a pool enclosure without corrosion of joints finishes and hardware
6984739 technology remains fairly constant over fairly long periods of time
6984740 there may be ongoing refinements and improvements which produce incremental benefits
6984741 the transmission of a bulk wave from a transmitter to a receiver that is a known distance away will take a very predictable amount of time
6984742 when the distance between them changes the transmission time will also change accurately measuring this transmission time will give a very accurate measurement of the distance in a unique and exciting way this technology allows weight measurement using a spring element load cell without the disadvantages found in strain gage load cells
6984743 overall accuracy of arlyn saw scales are approximately twenty times greater than strain gage scales
6984744 we have been able to eliminate some of the precision analog to digital circuitry previously required instead we have added significant processing capability to the scale controller that results in a fully featured easy to use highly accurate scale
6984745 there is no technical reason why the same technology cannot be used across the entire range of industrial weighing we are expecting to see our saw scales take a notable position in the field
6984746 wife no 19 or the story of a life in bondage
6984747 giving the most unbridled license to all the worst passions
6984748 its existence was denied loudly if in any way a whisper of it reached the outside world and the missionaries were cautioned to keep utter silence upon the subject among the saints it was received most reluctantly the women especially felt that a cross was being laid upon them greater than they could bear and many openly rebelled
6984749 generally accept it as i do as the will of god
6984750 a religious con man a higher up in a church of lies the kind of schemer who goes around saying god meant for man to have many women and children and that they shall be judged on how they obey
6984751 j ust your regular run of the mill polygamist boo hoo tragedy
6984752 i have no idea how many brothers and sisters i have there isnt a good way to count im going to guess i have a hundred siblings maybe one ten
6984753 so often plural marriage reduces a thoughtful generous mature woman to a sniveling selfish little girl perhaps it is the cruelest outcome the removal and destruction of a womans dignity
6984754 came to understand that i would lead a lonely existence here i did not have a husband in any sense of the word i was neither maiden widow nor even divorcee
6984755 greatest disappointment has been in realizing that my father like joseph and brigham before him tried to shroud his passions in the mantle of religion
6984756 she is correct my deceit has separated us and yet some truths come too late
6984757 ann eliza does not hold such a commanding position in my thoughts
6984758 wife is an inadequate term for each woman plays a different role in my life just as each person plays a different role in all our lives we label them all wives but they are not all wives
6984759 a dismal twist at the end of an epic tale
6984760 i bet he didnt tell you he had more than twenty wives
6984761 wait a minute was he that gulf war vet with that strange disease
6984762 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6984763 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6984764 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6984765 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6984766 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6984767 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6984768 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6984769 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
6984770 the vintner series is a new and exciting brand for wine cellar innovations it offers the look of a customizable luxury product at a mass produced price that is readily available
6984771 the deadline is only months away from going into effect yet when abc news and several of its affiliates investigated 23 hotel pools in different areas of the country they found that 16 were not compliant with the new standards
6984772 that is why we want to make sure that everyone is aware of the dangers including the users of public pools and spas swimmers and parents need to protect themselves while using any pool or spa
6984773 while the new guidelines are only mandated for public pools and spas we hope that private pool and spa owners will also take these simple precautions the potential to prevent one suction entrapment accident is well worth the minimal investment in time and money
6984774 per noi quella contro il ravenna sar una partita importante perch da questa inizia il cammino nella tim cup che vorremmo percorrere il pi possibile per in questa gara le insidie saranno dietro langolo il ravenna contro di noi moltiplicher le forze io ho gi parlato con i miei giocatori sanno come la penso non dovranno esserci cali di concentrazione dovranno lottare su ogni pallone cos come voglio che accada sempre in campionato perch sarebbe un errore pensare di aver gi vinto in italia nessuno si pu permettere di sottovalutare un avversario

6984779 there is a lack of web applications for enterprises that really exploit adobe air
6984780 it is a powerful tool that has enabled us to deliver a lightweight robust application straight to the desktop the technology means that users can access the system from a web browser or as an application running directly on their computer
6984781 so many companies use antiquated systems not only does this reduce the efficiency of information flow but staff have to work much harder sometimes across several parallel systems to achieve a result that could be automated by a flexible dynamic system
6984782 we have focused heavily on the user experience if staff are going to use this every day as a tool for work they need to trust and understand the system we are proud of how intuitive and simple the user interface is and we have found that no or very little training is required
6984783 claimable was built from the ground up to provide useful reports and management information there is rich pool of data behind the scenes and the system does a really good job of providing simple but powerful tools to access it
6984784 we can offer coal india our experience and expertise the coal industry in india is growing rapidly and they are increasingly conscious that they want to get it right in environmental and social terms they have been extremely impressed by what they have seen including how the north east has recuperated its former mining landscapes
6984785 we have exchanged constructive views with each other and will meet again
6984786 we do have suspicion that the rationale for the rejections might be because of the protests and our activities
6984787 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6984788 als we zestiende waren geworden hadden we het naar verwachting gedaan en bij een vijftiende plaats al beter dan verwacht maar nu we de finale hebben gehaald wil ik de komende vier jaar niemand meer horen zeuren
6984789 we can offer coal india our experience and expertise the coal industry in india is growing rapidly and they are increasingly conscious that they want to get it right in environmental and social terms they have been extremely impressed by what they have seen including how the north east has recuperated its former mining landscapes
6984790 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6984791 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
6984792 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
6984793 i go in once a day and pray for him
6984794 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
6984795 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him
6984796 il papa ha donato 120 mila dollari ai profughi georgiani

6984799 house prices are unlikely to continue rising at current rates
6984800 a moderate cooling in the housing market should one occur would not be inconsistent with the economy continuing to grow at or near its potential next year

6984804 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6984805 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6984806 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6984807 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6984808 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6984809 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6984810 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
6984811 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education
6984812 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
6984813 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be

6984819 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6984820 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6984821 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6984822 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
6984823 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
6984824 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
6984825 oh thats an easy problem to fix you just set up a redirect
6984826 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at about how he would improve their lives

6984829 i keep telling people that the dean campaign was like the wright brothers and obama was apollo 11
6984830 these guys skipped mercury and gemini they take a guy and they land him safely in the
6984831 clinton will be the last campaign run from the top down where you think youve got it all figured out
6984832 when you run it from the bottom you hear things and you couldnt help but understand that the quest for change was on fire out there how did they miss it
6984833 she could have started the whole thing off 5 million women willing to take on american politics women ready to protect the planet women ready to oppose the war instead she ran as a quintessential status quo establishment candidate it made no sense that they could miss that
6984834 i want to be on the side of the people on the side of the spirit of history
6984835 we focused on what was important that was delegates we targeted the delegates in the same way that were going after the electoral votes now its the same strategy
6984836 lets look at colorado well have 16 offices in colorado not five not three not two 16 western slope northern colorado eastern slope southern colorado metro denver the whole thing its the same in every state were targeting
6984837 he campaigns on reforming a broken political process yet he has always played politics by the rules as they exist not as he would like them to exist he runs as an outsider but he has succeeded by mastering the inside game
6984838 very methodical going down the field five yards five more yards five more yards very methodical very calculating very scientific very steady
6984839 they said this day would never come they said our sights were set too high
6984840 the question hasnt been asked that much here you have the first african american with a serious opportunity but were focusing not on his race but on the qualities of leadership he would bring to this country
6984841 this is just a first step there are a lot of steps to go
6984842 the dramatic plume of gas that has been gushing from a vent in the crater wall since march 11th has turned from fluffy white to dusky brown

6984845 being named the u s flag bearer for the closing ceremony is almost like winning a gold medal maybe even better

6984856 it is a typical cannabis factor everything is set up to grow cannabis and every bit of space needs to have plants on it
6984857 these factories try to reproduce a normal growing environment as far as possible
6984858 our primary concern is public safety and our own safety once we make the wiring in the house safe we will start removing the exhibits
6984859 it is not unheard of for these types of places to be booby trapped though it hasnt happened in suffolk so we have to be very careful

6984867 who may ascend into the hill of the lord and who may stand in his holy place he who has clean hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully

6984870 i have tendered a letter of withdrawal of my candidature after careful consideration and my party colleagues have prevailed over me and bolele to do so
6984871 i now support bolele in his challenge of the vp in the mahalapye west constituency this is for party unity and ultimately for national unity
6984872 as far as this reflects a loss of confidence by the business sector it is in sharp contrast to the findings of the business expectations survey
6984873 as houses stay on the market longer nervous owners have begun dropping their prices
6984874 as soon as i dropped the camera i looked around everywhere and there was nothing in the sky

6984876 it wasnt there when i took the camera away from my eye but it was there when i took the photo
6984877 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is

6984908 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations

6984910 it was a great comfort for me knowing she was with him
6984911 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site

6984913 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
6984914 i guess i just have a little more faith in my community than this
6984915 its been a multitude of things over the last few years that got us where were at

6984923 cuatro de nuestros soldados han sido hechos m rtires mientras que hemos matado a 35 milicianos y atacado varios de sus escondites
6984924 when we got a bill we said we might not be able to make it and they dont have scholarships at st marys but we were able to work something out
6984925 we lost a whole lot not just allen and andre but about 80 percent of our offense and seven defensive starters
6984926 we need robert to step up and take the reins right away hes got a cannon arm and our success this year is going to ride on that
6984927 winning four in a row is pretty close to impossible
6984928 last year it was a learning experience in humility for a veteran team
6984929 the ability to win was always there it was just a matter of humiliating the kids into executing
6984930 with all the young guys this year we need to get a taste of victory early on to build up confidence its hard to imagine rebounding from a bad start
6984931 all match long i didnt think i played my best volleyball i got it going in the end
6984932 david lee just came up with some huge blocks mvp right there
6984933 weve got so much motivation weve got motivation coming out of our ears
6984934 the thing that really sticks to me is our last break

6984938 i was really disappointed i brought everything i possibly had tonight and it wasnt enough i was trying to feel as good as i possibly could but it wasnt there today
6984939 i wanted to approach this like it was the last thing in the world
6984940 everything is a big miracle im the happiest woman here today on this track
6984941 im going to jump next year in terms of four years from now i doubt it
6984942 yeah just wait till you can only get work with children
6984943 id like it if we just did one of those things where we call him the former lincoln running back or no 24 or something like that
6984944 i love the kid but god am i tired of hearing his name
6984945 theres going to be a lot of parity in the league this year and that all comes down to lincoln not having david henderson
6984946 im not going to lie thats going to help the rest of us a whole lot
6984947 when youve got someone that great someone who is dominating every time he touches the ball it changes the whole makeup of the league
6984948 you cant replace something like that lincoln is still the favorite theyre the champs and they know how to win but i think everyones looking at it as wide open this year washington lowell mission will be in there and so will we
6984949 hes not as dynamic as henderson was but whats that saying
6984950 we call eric a water bug hes really good and so elusive
6984951 hes fast hes tough hes a hard worker and hes all muscle
6984952 the guys we have back are a big part of why weve been able to impose our will the last three years
6984953 but the leagues going to be more even and it will probably come down to a few moments a few big plays here and there
6984954 do i have to explain to you what constitutes an emergency
6984955 im not driving three hours to put together a shelf
6984956 fifty seven pounds what kind of shelving did you buy
6984957 please tell me you didnt how did you get it into your car
6984958 i cannot i will not drive back to help you put shelving together just wait until your dad gets home
6984959 im sure hed rather help you bring it in than find you laying on the floor of the garage with a fifty seven pound shelf on top of you fifty se geez jess howd you know it weighed that much anyway
6984960 unless you want to wait for your dad which you refuse to do yes youre going to have to do this by yourself
6984961 you know a stud finder isnt like a nail gun jess you cant kill someone with it youd have better luck punching them
6984962 im proud of you for dragging that whole thing in by yourself
6984963 we zijn leuk onthaald door de andere atleten in het olympisch dorp en hebben champagne gedronken
6984964 we hebben een frietje en een hamburger gegeten om de schade in te halen daarna hebben we nog een stapje in de wereld gezet
6984965 al weten we niet goed welke verplichtingen we nog allemaal hebben
6984966 hey baby i know some stress positions that will blow your mind
6984967 dudes if its one world whats the deal with the wall
6984968 everyone says im hitting now because some guy says so on tv
6984969 aw cmon shawn show us that medal just one more time
6984970 hes a regular guy when it comes to being a teammate
6984971 the thing ive gotten to learn about him is his work ethic is pretty impressive he knows hes a pretty special player hes gone about it impressively
6984972 we had a meeting with 25 players who felt like a team we havent felt like that for a week
6984973 evidently the boston thing was something he wanted to change
6984974 i had a great 12 years in new york managing the yankees it was time to go somewhere else
6984975 the guys have received me with open arms its been great
6984976 it feels like im on vacation im here for another month or two after this i dont know whats going to happen im living day by day
6984977 weve been able to achieve another level of fans because obviously dancing with the stars reaches 25 million fans every monday
6984978 but meeting oprah was pretty cool man come on you dont meet oprah every day i was able to dance in front of oprah
6984979 i dont see the bad thing in finishing second were in the hunt for this championship because of a lot of seconds
6984980 people keep talking about it weve been trying you dont want to go crazy we want to think about championships too
6984981 i was telling him you have to smile more and stop counting
6984982 theres a lot of potential for open wheel to become what it was in the past
6984983 and i have a lot of goals i still want to win the championship i want to win the indy 500
6984984 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
6984985 i wish i would have had the chance to play with him
6984986 but this is the next best thing trying to show off some of the things hes taught me
6984987 owners like those guys a lot younger the ones with the madison avenue executive look
6984988 i think its trying to reinvent the wheel as far as statistics are concerned
6984989 its not the way statistics have been run thus far
6984990 why should i feel bad im doing my best it wasnt good enough it ended up working out with the team getting the win and i ended up getting the win as a reliever
6984991 but i think if you come in and say youre sorry to a person it puts things in perspective that youre not trying your best as a teammate you dont need to say youre sorry if youre doing what youre trying to do
6984992 were going to be in the same situation weve been in all year weve got an outstanding right fielder randy winn its not going to be easy getting nate the playing time you want to get him guys are going to need days off well do what we can to get him some playing time
6984993 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better today it could be better on sunday
6984994 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6984995 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6984996 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
6984997 j t will be our starter going into the season
6984998 hes got very good command of the offense and played well in all three preseason games but now its time to get ready for the season
6984999 the perception will be wrong if that is the perception
6985000 because i think he is getting better and better right now
6985001 i dont see it as a problem we want to play our best players alex has a lot of ability and a lot of potential and hes going to be a good quarterback in this league hes just not there at this point
6985002 this has not been a case of shaun and alex not performing well
6985003 this has been a case of j t performing well
6985004 in fairness to john and jed scot and i kept them apprised
6985005 this is what we all dreamed about four years getting back to this point
6985006 we havent done anything yet weve got one more game to go
6985007 when we played the usa last time we did a terrible job
6985008 i dont know the odds that well win but i am sure that the same thing wont happen again
6985009 we know we have very few chances but we have chances
6985010 we are not satisfied with the silver medal we will look forward to the gold
6985011 the game plan was to get in our heads rattle us up out there and i think we did a hell of a job just keeping our composure
6985012 they wanted to play physical and we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game
6985013 im pretty sure yall got a chance the chance is 50 50 right now
6985014 right now with two teams out of it its all about pace of game so they call a lot of first pitch strikes so everyone starts swinging the bat its a frustrating way to hit
6985015 if im not patient im not doing my job if they continue to do that purposely i dont have time for that but thats the way its going to be the rest of the season ive seen it happen before
6985016 i was trying to finish the year strong and instead im basically spinning my wheels
6985017 its tough i want to make things happen im not here just to be here if i didnt care id just drag the bat up there and then drag it back to the dugout
6985018 counting all the wins we couldnt pull out for him earlier in the season he would have been up there with webb 18 19 wins hes doing a great job i hope he stays the same
6985019 i never had many strikeouts in a season the closest i came was in college my junior year when i had 199 pitching coach dave righetti came up and gave me the ball and congratulated me that was pretty nice to hear
6985020 he reminded me of pedro feliz a little bit because of the arm its that good
6985021 in 39 though i was very close to him at the university games
6985022 he probably did not want to talk to me though i scored seven goals against the german team
6985023 and i was only an average swimmer so i had to do something other people did not do
6985024 i was never afraid to get into a fight in the pool
6985025 it was the dream of engineers for hundreds of years
6985026 i walk every day the path by the belvedere cove seashore one hour rain or shine
6985027 then jonny moseley won a gold medal in skiing at the 1998 olympics there was a celebration for him in belvedere then somehow it became known that the city has another gold medalist
6985028 when you make plays theyll give you more opportunities and coach will call more plays for you
6985029 thats what we have to do for him make him feel confident enough that we can make plays that he can call the plays for us
6985030 were going to come out and throw it a lot
6985031 itll be good to see i know we can run the football thats no secret to come out and run the ball again in this game really isnt important because im not worried about that
6985032 i want to see how much we can do with our first unit throwing the ball so it will be a good test for us
6985033 thats what were going to do until we click 100 percent and perfect it like we should
6985034 the run is definitely a major base part of our offense
6985035 when opportunities come our way weve got to take advantage of them weve got to make plays
6985036 that was a big bounce back for me after the white sox game when i was a little out of whack i was more in control more in the zone
6985037 enjoy whats happening hes a young guy enjoying himself its a great olympics just enjoy it the guy is a freak of nature hes putting on a show on the biggest stage
6985038 words cant explain four guys going out there believing in each other we wanted to show the world jamaica is a very special country teamwork having fun you cant ask for anything more
6985039 i come out here to perform and let people enjoy themselves the crowd loves it they look forward to seeing me come out doing it they pay good money to see great performances its my work i enjoy it its just me i wont change ill always be myself its my personality
6985040 he talks only to the director about the direction and acting of the production he does not give actor notes to the actors though he will answer any questions they ask him if he does not agree with a particular choice he will mention it to the director that is as far as he goes he lets the director make the final decisions about the production for him it is an honour to see his work onstage he enjoys watching each interpretation of his work and said that he learns from each performance
6985041 are todays new playwrights so perfect that changing a single word in a script will throw the play in an entirely different direction is every word in a work of art never to be changed regardless of the discovered realities of actually putting it on the stage or are these playwrights so insecure about their writing that they fear the intended story will be lost if a single i has its dot removed
6985042 the dramatists guild would have you think writers are the focal point of the creation of theatre everything onstage is their vision and everything is subservient to the writer writers are no more creative than any other artist they have different inputs they have different outputs but no matter how great a script may be an audience will probably never enjoy a night at the theatre without the production coming alive off the page no production will be great without both halves working together in sync
6985043 this play can be performed by any number of actors it can be performed in any order
6985044 theres a curious leap in logic here between writers insisting very firmly on strict adherence to a very broad concept of authorial intent and treating their collaborators as enemies and actually changing the words of their plays
6985045 its not hard to imagine a world where a theatre would clean up the language of a play to appease a funder or cut a gay love scene or some such thing
6985046 have to cut alter and bastardize the already not necessarily definitive texts of his plays
6985047 we are in fact way more disrespectful of the classics than we are of contemporary plays in terms of textual fidelity
6985048 the country has been implementing pmtct since 2000 but the regiments that we are using in uganda dont reduce mother to child transmission mtct markedly
6985049 today research has shown us that if all hiv pregnant mothers are given a triple combination of arvs we can reduce mtct to almost 1
6985050 now that more resources are available we are advocating for a triple combination this is being done in developing countries

6985090 it seems to be a hot spot that were trying to keep under control
6985091 were trying to keep them always guessing about what it is that were doing so that its not safe for either one of them to come out on east marshall without fear of being arrested
6985092 it helped having ruby there not just for warmth but for moral support as well
6985093 it was a great comfort for me knowing she was with him
6985094 were going to be ready weve been waiting for this for four years
6985095 its good to be at this point weve waited for four years for this
6985096 that experience is only going to make this experience that much better
6985097 i think we did a hell of a job just keeping our composure
6985098 we knew that was their game plan from the get go they wanted to play physical we played physical with them i think we beat them at their own game
6985099 its time to enjoy our moment we played a really bad game against the u s you know but now we learn a lot from that experience and we want to try to win the finals
6985100 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
6985101 i was just trying to play the game they were just down there trying to be physical i was trying to be physical back with them
6985102 it was a little bit chirpy out there but nothing personal nothing major they were trying to win and we were trying to win
6985103 i kind of had an idea of what i could do but that gave me more confidence in getting in the game a lot more than i was and showing the coaches what i could do when i got the ball
6985104 coming from track and everything you cant go on an 80percent hamstring in football youve got to fight through it thats something i had to learn being here
6985105 go man up and darel has done that has he won all of them no he hasnt but hes won his fair share hes kind of really showed me something
6985106 i wasnt really taking care of my body like i should have i stretch a lot more
6985107 my legs are a lot stronger my upper body is stronger too i tried to get my body right so i could take those hits and stay healthy
6985108 i really started to get into the body parts how all the muscles connect it is really interesting
6985109 i can understand where coach friedgen is coming from because i have to stay low to take those hits thats something im trying to focus on staying low in the hole
6985110 i knew the role i had to play last year i had to come in and change the game i dont want to be a one play guy and come out
6985111 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6985112 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6985113 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6985114 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6985115 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust
6985116 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6985117 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6985118 its been written a couple times that last week was my best chance so obviously the media have better insight than i do chances are going to come opportunities are going to come i have to make the best of them
6985119 what youre asking me is if smith plays well is he going to be the starter we havent decided
6985120 when he first came here a lot of guys thought who is this cocky young kid he can come across as being arrogant but we need that out there in order to lead 10 other guys you have to have that type of demeanor
6985121 he knows what to do to put the team in position to win
6985122 i think thats what hes been able to do i think that is what he has exemplified since february that he can be a leader on this team and that he can be a top flight quarterback in this league
6985123 its not uncommon that a team names their starting quarterback at the end
6985124 so now we know that troys going to start this game and theres a high possibility that he may start during the season so weve just got to back him and move forward
6985125 anytime you step into a situation where passes are going to be in the game plan you want to hit them all but this is not a perfect game
6985126 its not the chalkboard i can draw things up in different ways and show you how to beat defenses but once you get out there on the field the guys are not going to be in the same places but this is the preseason we still have a long way to go a long way
6985127 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice
6985128 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6985129 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6985130 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6985131 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6985132 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6985133 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6985134 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6985135 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression

6985156 oh well thats more than i was expecting but that was totally worth it
6985157 caught this video today right after i was walking out the coffee shop
6985158 i have learnt that there is no limitation to the human ability
6985159 had i thought of myself as a lesser human being because of being deaf then i would have surely ended up a burden to society instead
6985160 were it not for my parents i would be nothing today
6985161 they were poor but they gave me the greatest gift a parent can give a child love and understanding they did not reject me as other parents do their children with disabilities they made sure that i went to school and achieved the best in life my condition notwithstanding
6985162 although they had no training of how to handle children with disabilities my teachers always encouraged me to pursue education
6985163 they would write a lot on the blackboard just for my sake my peers too would give me their notes to read and assisted me where they could
6985164 many people never thought that a deaf person could actually continue with education to high school level they had never seen any before and so they concluded that i was just joking around no one was willing to give me a chance
6985165 i was mesmerised by the structure of the english language and had to learn it through all effort
6985166 although i am happy about my achievement there would be more people with the equivalent of my qualifications or even better had they been given the necessary support in their academic endeavours
6985167 i always compared myself with others so as to know how i was faring
6985168 although i realised my limitation i did not allow it to hinder me from excelling in those activities which i felt i could do equally with other people
6985169 i enjoy sharing my knowledge with students i find it very enlightening to me everyday is a learning day and that is what life is all about

6985173 sorry i have other things that are more pressing you are not listening to reason so i will no longer respond to this thread good luck and good bye
6985174 details that go into making the thing work simply but as well the casual observer also doesnt understand the depth of knowledge that is required to bring everything together making that
6985175 high tech device im referring to tools like refined programming skills an in depth knowledge of electronics amp physics a good mechanical background good research skills good documentation skills good communications skills etc
6985176 after they realised we werent from home amp away there was this dead silence
6985177 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
6985178 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry
6985179 i was like adams the nicest guy in the world of course hes going to say that then his producer called the following week theyve had me on five times this year

6985181 shows like little britain and the league of gentlemen started as radio shows and then went to tv
6985182 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
6985183 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
6985184 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash

6985190 does she or doesnt she have arms this get up leaves no trace of a figure
6985191 they look as if somebody found a discarded warehouse full of frumpy eastern european clothes and fabrics from the 60s and everybody put three outfits on haphazardly one fashion critic wrote on an iranian blog
6985192 some critics smugly suggested the press corps were better dressed than the models who appeared uninterested as they plodded across the stage in plaids floral patterns and the odd dash of pink
6985193 iranian women wear a lot better and are much more fashionable than that in the street
6985194 still the countrys culture and islamic orientation minister saffar harandi hailed the show as a success
6985195 this is an unparalleled event for iranian women who until now have not had the opportunity to dress how they want to but have been forced to wear whatever the fashion industry imposes on our society
6985196 women wore headscarves in medieval times to maintain their modesty

6985208 it went from a wetland and a pond that all of us liked and where ducks lived to a mudhole with a little stream flowing through it
6985209 it was built as a water detention system and because that system is there we need to maintain it as such as a detention system
6985210 we were amazed that this got built in the wetland
6985211 i never got a straight answer about how that happened id still like to get an answer
6985212 remain wooded operating as a screen and buffer to residences to the south
6985213 i am just as frustrated as you are about this one
6985214 the whole system has way less water than it did previously
6985215 i dont think they thought about the wetlands they were more concerned about storm events
6985216 we understand if we were to build today we couldnt because its a wetland
6985217 we know its a wetland and we should not have built there but today we have a detention system there and we know we need to maintain it in an environmentally conscious way
6985218 they think that if they keep it up well get tired and go away
6985219 this whole thing is going to blow up in their face and is going to end up being ugly

6985221 dalam berbagai versi iklannya kedua tokoh itu termasuk satu di antara sejumlah politisi yang iklannya paling sering muncul di media terutama televisi
6985222 dana iklan relatif walaupun prinsipnya ada strategi dan melihat target audiensnya kalau kabupaten tarifnya beda jika target audiensnya nasional iklan politik itu mahal sekali
6985223 bagi politisi kita yang kebanyakan instan dengan beriklan memang bisa dikenal tapi sebatas dikenal masyarakat tidak tahu dia siapa dan satu lagi iklan itukan dananya besar padahal modal finansial tidak selalu menentukan kemenangan belanja iklan besar belum tentu menang
6985224 di indonesia kita bisa lihat saat pemilu 2004 pdip saat itu belanja iklannya paling besar tapi kan juga nggak menang pemilu jadi iklan dimana mana tidak menentukan dan jangan yakin akan menang
6985225 kalau ada politisi yang mempunyai reputasi bagus iklan bisa dikurangi dan disalurkan untuk bikin kegiatan yang lebih menyentuh dan berguna untuk rakyat

6985238 the existence of roads and the use of roads are the biggest factors in wildlife habitat fragmentation and harm to cultural resources

6985244 i was against the war and he was against the war long before he was called back
6985245 i think its futile it never should have been fought its the saddest thing ever in my life
6985246 speak to the cost of the war not in terms of money but in terms of human loss and human suffering which is pretty much glazed over in mainstream media
6985247 in this particular situation theres really only a small segment of the society that is making the sacrifice and its the ultimate sacrifice and we feel its really really important that people share in that sacrifice with them

6985250 do not include the power to decide for the entire legislature when and how it shall go to court
6985251 this office represents differing view points of legislators all the time
6985252 the legislature is not some superlitigant that can ride around the state injecting itself in legal cases wherever it thinks it has some arguable interest
6985253 its blm land that land belongs to me it belongs to us
6985254 gives kids appreciation for their families and roots arms them with a real understanding of helping their neighbors working hard and getting through lifes difficulties and yet we are restricting activity there
6985255 i find it so ironic that the blm can administer lands in moab where four wheelers bikes and jeeps can tear the living daylights out of the landscape and it doesnt cost visitors a dime
6985256 on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere is good for youth and should be encouraged
6985257 i think the blm has been very fair theyve allowed us to use the trail and im grateful for that

6985263 any random drug testing is going to infringe on privacy
6985264 it doesnt seem like a wise use of resources in the present economy besides invading peoples privacy
6985265 it could be considered unconstitutional i havent seen the details but more than that its overkill
6985266 drug testing is increasing in just about every level not only in government but also in the private sector
6985267 im going to decline to comment on what the 9th circuit says is appropriate
6985268 but i would say that generally speaking drug testing has been upheld as constitutional and appropriate not only in government but in the private sector and schools as well

6985315 we know that one in 10 children in any day of the week is on these medicines they are very widely used and they deserve to have modern evidence
6985316 if the evidence is negative then they shouldnt be available
6985317 for children under 12 these medicines were not studied by modern standards
6985318 back in that time there werent special clinical trials in children
6985319 but the new science in children tells us it is actually necessary to study children to be certain we are giving the right dose to measure the side effects and the effectiveness
6985320 we believe these drugs need to be conformed to modern standards

6985341 now theyve got to go through the work of trying to get back there again
6985342 any time youre slated to play one of the top teams its going to be an exciting game but the fact that we finished last season against them im sure our guys will have a little more incentive in that game
6985343 theyre going to be one of the top teams in the country again itll be a big game just from a rivalry factor

6985346 the things that made us successful in the ncaa tournament against michigan michigan state and new hampshire weve got to remember what kind of price we paid to get to that point
6985347 if we assume things will just fall in place thats not how it works were going to have to play with that same kind of passion we played with in the ncaa tournament just to get back there again

6985372 the galapagos islands are dull and uninteresting compared to the philippines
6985373 the philippines has fantastic diversity both in plants and animals the level of endemism is certainly the highest in the world

6985384 the unified contract is likely the product of the arroyo governments sweetheart deal with saudi recruiters this is what the saudi national recruitment committee sanarcom is getting in exchange for their sudden endorsement of gloria arroyos supermaids program
6985385 the philippine government could not have just sweet talked its way into convincing the saudi recruiters to agree with its policy
6985386 presented a deal that the saudis couldnt afford to refuse this is what scares us
6985387 we strongly oppose this scheme because it is virtually devoid of any consultation with the philippine government industry stakeholders and most especially with the filipino migrant workers groups and overseas contract workers who will be greatly disadvantaged by the proposed onerous scheme

6985389 there is the almost p10 billion owwa trust fund pooled from every ofws intended for that purpose aside from the fund allocated by the government to the dfa atn for the repatriation of stranded ofws
6985390 as public official thats there foremost duty anyway but the agencies concerned for ofws repatriation such as owwa and the dfas assistance to the nationals atn are only sleeping on the cases of stranded and distressed ofws who are mostly victims of their abusive employers thus they opted to ran away from their employers to seek refuge from rp officials abroad
6985391 incompetent officials abroad are but a reflection of how the present arroyo administrations badly treated ofws and their families

6985435 they the milf must show good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating and that good faith is to surrender the two who perpetrated these atrocities and stop condoning it at least if not encouraging
6985436 we are pragmatic enough to realize that we dont know who is sincere and who is not and so we shall give them that option through dialogue however if they refuse to heed that call and seek another path we shall be ready to take appropriate action

6985441 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6985442 first such canned humor often disrupts the natural flow of conversation and jokes that fail to deliver humor are a violation of a social contract so punishing the teller can discourage similar behavior in the future

6985455 die deutsche bahn hat was expansionen betrifft ihre f hler bereits in viele richtungen ausgestreckt wenn man berlegt in rum nien hinzuzukaufen kann ich mir vorstellen dass sich dies positiv auf die sp tere aktienkursentwicklung auswirkt
6985456 kommt es tats chlich zu einer bernahme dann w re dies ein zeichen daf r dass das management der deutschen bahn seine expansionsstrategie z gig weiterverfolgt schlie lich strebt man danach sowohl im personen als auch im g terverkehr neue kunden hinzuzugewinnen
6985457 aufgrund der baunutzungsverordnung ist es dem unternehmen kaum noch m glich seine filialexpansion weiter fortzusetzen
6985458 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6985459 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6985460 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihren kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben

6985463 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zu buchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet

6985466 die biodiesel produzenten werden von allen seiten in die mangel genommen sei es von der politik den mineral lkonzernen oder der automobilbranche
6985467 die schwierigkeiten f r die biodiesel produzenten sind auch aufgrund der billig exporte etwa aus den usa immens

6985496 i would tell him to come on board and visit the people of gaza as he should have done many many times by now and see the situation himself then act upon what he sees
6985497 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral

6985505 what choice do we have of course we can always go to peru and see if we can find a way to work with the shining path guerrilla movement but will that be any better than what we have to work with here
6985506 the warok come from east java from ponorogo they started as the followers of a poet in a fifteenth century kingdom theyre supposed to have magical powers but only if they avoid sex with women so they have sex with young boys melati was also telling me about the royal courts in bali and in aceh in sumatra men there also had sex with boys have you heard of sedattis

6985508 were catamites young dancing boys you got them in both north and south sumatra their job was to entertain men there was something similar in other parts of indonesia on bali little boys called gandrungs would dress up as girls and dance for the men
6985509 people in this country have terrible ideas about homosexuals which i think is because they dont know any better
6985510 in 2002 the south sulawesi administration became the first to pass an anti prostitution bylaw that criminalizes homosexuality two years later the palembang administration passed a similar bylaw
6985511 i shall not fail to include among these precepts a new discovery an aid to reflection which although it seems a small thing and almost laughable nevertheless is very useful in stimulating the mind to various discoveries this is look at walls splashed with a number of stains or stones of various mixed colours if you have to invent some scene you can see there resemblances to a number of landscapes adorned in various ways with mountains rivers rocks trees great plains valleys and hills moreover you can see various battles and rapid actions of figures strange expressions on faces costumes and an infinite number of things which you can reduce to good integrated form this happens thus on walls and varicoloured stones as in the sound of bells in whose pealing you can find every name and word you can imagine do not despise my opinion when i remind you that it should not be hard for you to stop sometimes and look into the stains on the walls or the ashes of a fire or clouds or mud or like things in which if you consider them well you will find really marvellous ideas the mind of the painter is stimulated to new discoveries the composition of battles of animals and men various compositions of landscapes and monstrous things and similar creations which may bring you honour because the mind is stimulated to new invetions by obscure things
6985512 choose an old ruined wall spread over it a piece of white silk then every morning and evening look at it until at last you can see the ruin through the silk its bumps levels zig zags and cracks fixing them in your mind and your eyes make the bumps into your mountains the deepest parts your rivers the hollows your ravines the cracks your streams the lightest parts your closest points the darkest parts your most distant points fix all that deeply within you and soon you will see men birds plants and trees and figures flying or moving between them then you can use your brush as you will and the result will be a heavenly not a man made thing

6985527 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
6985528 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6985529 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it

6985532 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6985533 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6985534 ive been traveling the state and in the last few days people have been taking this very seriously
6985535 i think tuesday will be very telling and it will be a great day for senator mccain
6985536 although that is the most overrated aspect of american politics
6985537 its important that we win in november and i think john mccain gives us the best chance to win in november

6985552 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6985553 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6985554 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry
6985555 we believe that this company plans to sell the sydney site and it is about trying to increase the sale price of that site by transferring contracts there
6985556 its now incumbent on premier john brumby to indicate whether there has been any engagement with the company on the issue and whether the government could have done more to retain these jobs

6985574 the film industry has always been an unorganised sector with the entry of corporates in this sector it has become more organised and corporatised this means that producers want to insure their productions to mitigate some losses
6985575 film insurance is a tricky trade it requires complete understanding of the film industry it cant be treated like other insurance policies because film production is a fairly complicated process involving people and equipment

6985579 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6985580 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6985581 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6985582 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6985583 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6985584 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6985585 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment subscribe
6985586 i too was reprimanded for waxing my arms out of curiosity when i was in 9th standard
6985587 i enjoy it because i get to meet a lot of people and i like talking to others but its kept me busy
6985588 im still a little off but i trained a lot harder for this year
6985589 its the last mile the audience my logic is this can you beat me at the box office
6985590 there is a variety of ways in which a picture gets made in hollywood but i can say without qualification that in hindi pictures stars are the determining factor much more than they are in los angeles
6985591 a star guarantees the first weekend box office and it is this business which decides all the other revenue streams
6985592 they are willing to pay a premium to establish themselves its the pressure to have big films under your belt
6985593 when people offer too much money i refuse to hear the script
6985594 because money is a very strong force i might start liking scenes which i didnt before because i can see extra zeroes behind it
6985595 but in the long run it may be a pyrrhic victory if they want such a large slice of the pie it might lower the possibility of collaborating with top line talent
6985596 there is too much money chasing too little talent and people are just making projects
6985597 but at some point the consumer will refuse to pay 200 rupees
6985598 i too was reprimanded for waxing my arms out of curiosity when i was in 9th standard

6985606 everyone who has come before me has done their duty so i have to make an extra effort
6985607 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden

6985622 learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace
6985623 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6985624 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6985625 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6985626 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6985627 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6985628 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6985629 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6985630 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6985631 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6985632 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6985633 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6985634 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6985635 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6985636 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6985637 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6985638 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6985639 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6985640 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6985641 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6985642 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6985643 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6985646 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6985647 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6985648 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6985649 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6985650 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6985651 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6985652 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6985653 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6985654 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6985655 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6985656 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6985657 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6985658 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6985663 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6985664 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6985665 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6985666 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6985667 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6985668 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6985669 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6985670 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6985671 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6985672 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6985673 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6985674 about a year ago i made a film for the bbc about a sailing race and during the course of it i got into a filthy temper
6985675 i started shouting at the blameless people who were racing with me i flew into a rage about something which was completely beyond my control it was actually nothing new for me i do get cross this is a film about being angry im going to talk to other people about their propensity to fly into a rage to throw a wobbler to lose it
6985676 in a survey by the mental health foundation released in march 2008 more than 1 in 10 of those polled said they had trouble with their tempers
6985677 thirty two per cent said they were worried by anger in the family in these programmes im going to look at what makes people angry whether theres more of it about and what if anything can be done about it
6985678 im an actor im a writer i run a production company im successful with a lot of work perhaps a bit too much which i insist on doing myself and i have to admit when it all builds up there are times when it gets too much
6985679 it has been a long time coming where you felt that buzz i cant say i wish i was part of it right now because im a red wing but its great to see the fans getting excited again about blackhawk hockey
6985680 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6985682 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6985683 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6985684 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6985685 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6985686 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6985687 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6985688 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6985689 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6985690 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6985691 who are open to doing something on the production side
6985692 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

6985694 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6985695 but just like giving your ailing dog a pill tucked inside a scrumptious treat were gonna wrap our unabashedly liberal patriotism in something a thousand times more delicious than a snausage the obamaburger but this isnt just any cheeseburger why well other than being named after not that theres anything wrong with that and were not talkin about just any bacon here were talkin about what may be the best gourmet bacon in the country bentons smoked country bacon bentons smoky mountain country hams has been producing award winning country hams domestic prosciutto and bacon in the hills of madisonville tennessee since 1973 in 2007 the southern foodways alliance bestowed the jack daniels lifetime achievement award allans meats are served in some of the finest restaurants in the country because of their distinctive full mouthwatering flavor burger with just beef bacon and buns thats why were piling bentons hickory smoked country bacon on top of a char grilled mound of juicy kobe beef reflecting obama s pan asian upbringing topping it with gooey wisconsin cheddar spicy michelle fist pumped caramelized onions and a dollop of our very own secret south side sauce we then cram all that goodness between two slices of marble rye celebrating baracks multiracial background and feed it to our panini press transforming it into the ultimate patty melting pot that is america add a heaping side of harvard yard baked beans commemorating baracks days as the my fellow americans is the obamaburger

6985712 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6985713 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6985714 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6985715 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6985716 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6985717 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6985718 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6985719 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6985720 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6985721 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6985722 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6985723 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6985724 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6985725 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6985726 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6985727 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6985728 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6985729 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6985730 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6985731 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6985735 what was more important to him was tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires
6985736 sen coleman has demonstrated that you can significantly raise benefits without raising taxes as he did with over 30 votes that have increased veterans funding by nearly 70 during his time in office
6985737 should be rooted in preserving and strengthening the important patient doctor relationship
6985738 making health insurance more affordable not increasing the governments role
6985739 we can turn health care in steps over to government control and learn to live with mediocrity or we can work in a bipartisan fashion to extend benefits of individually owned health insurance to those uninsured
6985740 i believe the latter approach will provide greater access and better quality health care
6985741 families in this state are facing a health care crisis because washington isnt looking out for them
6985742 unite around the goal of accessible affordable health care for every texas family
6985743 texans deserve a health care system that works for them not for big insurance and the washington lobbyists
6985744 texans deserve real health care security for their families lowered costs for employers and more transparency and accountability than our current system provides
6985745 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking with an object
6985746 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
6985747 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
6985748 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6985749 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6985750 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6985751 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6985752 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272
6985753 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6985754 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6985755 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6985756 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6985757 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6985758 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6985759 our watt system is like a currency you get a certain amount of watts as you do more things you get more watts instead of voting on ideas you invest your watts in concepts you like so if a company decided to offer 5 000 for the best new logo to come out of kluster some graphically inclined members might upload a few sketches other members could then invest watts in the design they think is best suited for the company s product make suggestions for improvements or upload their own variation of the logo whichever logo gets picked by the company at the end wins the 5 000 which is distributed to all the members who backed that particular logo based on how much they contributed to the idea how early they got behind it and what percentage of their total watts they put at risk kluster computes what your stake is in any given project
6985760 students for a free tibet has organized eight nonviolent direct actions here while weve been in china successfully we call it our lucky eight
6985761 this is not the end of our campaign this is only the beginning
6985762 when china was awarded the olympics protest was inevitable what were doing today is standing in solidarity with tibetans inside tibet
6985763 thousands remain detained and missing following chinas violent and brutal crackdown against tibetans who risked everything taking to the streets to speak out for human rights freedom and justice
6985764 while we know that the chinese authorities are likely to step up their attacks on tibetans in the coming months as the olympic spotlight fades we also know that change only comes when people stand up and demand it the historic protests that have taken place in beijing in tibet and around the world this olympic year have ensured that tibet is recognized as an issue of global significance that demands immediate attention from the chinese leadership and governments around the world
6985765 wir hatten es bef rchtet die olympischen spiele in peking waren berschattet von festnahmen verurteilungen zensur berwachung und schikanen ber 100 journalisten blogger und dissidenten waren davon betroffen
6985766 an diese unterdr ckung wird man sich erinnern wenn man an die olympischen spiele in peking denkt und f r dieses versagen muss auch das internationale olympisches komitee ioc verantwortung bernehmen die mitglieder des ioc m ssen die richtigen schl sse aus diesen erfahrungen ziehen und sie umsetzen wenn sie im n chsten jahr den nachfolger von jaques rogge w hlen
6985767 wir fordern weiter dass die achtung der meinungsfreiheit eines der auswahlkriterien wird nach denen olympische austragungsst tten ausgesucht werden
6985768 wir gr en all jene in china und im ausland die nicht aufgeh rt haben mehr meinungsfreiheit bei den olympischen spielen einzufordern
6985769 wir bleiben wachsam f r den fall dass es nach den spielen zu einer neuen welle der repression kommt
6985770 sie folgen mir st ndig machen fotos und filmen mich
6985771 ich denke zweimal dar ber nach ob ich chinesen zu heiklen themen interviewe denn ich f rchte sie k nnten festgenommen werden

6985774 the more energy dense a food is the more a person with ear infections likes it you can see what that would do to weight gain
6985775 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention
6985776 we need to study larger numbers of people and do taste testing on them to find out more about this possible connection
6985777 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6985778 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6985779 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6985780 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6985781 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6985782 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play
6985783 this is probably one of the single most significant food safety actions done for fresh produce in many years
6985784 they dont have the resources the authority or the political will to really protect consumers from unsafe food
6985785 this achievement is the result of several years of combined efforts between community health plan and our community health center providers to ensure the best possible care to children throughout the state
6985786 what was novel about our approach to treating children was the partnership we have with our community health center delivery system and our ability to put the needs of the patient first
6985787 as a health insurer and advocate for washingtons individuals and families who deserve the best possible health care community health plan has a business model that leverages compassionate performance based care with a laser focus on financial efficiency the plan enables public dollars to be directed to those it is intended to benefit washingtons families
6985788 our ranking of number one in kids immunizations exemplifies the elevated quality of care provided by a community health center focused delivery system
6985789 carbon filtration of tap water will dramatically lower levels of toxic by products it is also 10 to 20 times less expensive than bottled water and does not produce the waste and pollution associated with the packaging and transport of bottled water

6985795 sinofresh nasal spray used three times daily appeared to effectively eliminate mrsa in the noses of the test animals while leaving enough normal microbes to keep a normal population in the nasal passages
6985796 since bacteria can in effect change their metabolism to be resistant to antibiotics but cant very well change the laws of physics the chances for development of resistance to sinofresh nasal sprays mode of killing them is much lower
6985797 these results have exceeded our expectations the positive results of this in vivo study gives us the solid scientific platform we have needed in order to advance our efforts to fight mrsa to the next level
6985798 il blitz della coalizione guidata dagli usa contro il mullah dadullah stata resa possibile dalle forze di sicurezza nazionale afghane e dalla gente afghana nel tempo il mullah dadullah sar senza dubbio sostituito ma linsurrezione ha sicuramente ricevuto un forte colpo
6985799 ecco il corpo di un uomo che decapitava e impiccava persone innocenti
6985800 sono molto triste come gli altri combattenti era un uomo buono e solidale si prendeva cura degli amici ed era amato dalla gente
6985801 dadullah ha impiccato o decapitato persone identificate come criminali gente che si appurato essere spie della nato o del governo ci non significa necessariamente che non fosse una persona gentile questa la politica della jihad si fa per impartire una lezione agli altri
6985802 vi sono comandanti talebani che avevano paura di contattare il governo perch avevano paura di dadullah
6985803 ora il governo afghano ha una buona opportunit di iniziare una trattativa di pace con i talebani
6985804 dadullah era lorganizzatore di tutte le offensive militari e degli attacchi suicidi in afghanistan assisteremo a uninterruzione temporanea dei loro attacchi
6985805 vi sono migliaia di combattenti talebani che possono prendere il suo posto
6985806 una perdita irreparabile per i talebani non troveranno mai nessuno coraggioso come dadullah
6985807 con i talebani decapitati ad helmand ha aggiunto wafa lesercito afghano e i suoi alleati stranieri lanceranno presto attacchi sui campi talebani nella provincia
6985808 quando ho saputo del mullah dadullah sono rimasto molto turbato
6985809 i talebani controllano il nostro distretto e siamo molto contenti di loro questa zona sicura non ci sono ladri signori della guerra o altri problemi
6985810 il mullah dadullah era un mujahid difendeva sempre la nostra gente
6985811 non aveva paura e ha combattuto i britannici faccia a faccia
6985812 era una persona crudele spero che le cose miglioreranno ora perch nessun altro comandante talebano pu fare le cose che faceva dadullah ora forse le cose finalmente andranno meglio
6985813 this will lead to more hurricanes an increase in the death of polar bears and the end of antarctica as we know it
6985814 hes not going to play a lot even if he was healthy

6985816 our soldiers your canadian soldiers serve to make a difference and be a part of something far greater than any one individual could accomplish
6985817 they serve and if necessary sacrifice themselves for freedom democracy and respect for human life
6985818 hes an extremely hardworking man he was the kind of guy you looked at like a big brother
6985819 he was a good father a good husband and a really good soldier
6985820 he would have been proud and he is proud im sure to have sacrificed himself serving his country
6985821 however theres a time for mourning and theres a time and place for standing up and carrying on
6985822 lunica cosa che davvero mi d fastidio a kandahar sono gli uomini armati ancora al potere

6985827 cuatro de nuestros soldados han sido hechos m rtires mientras que hemos matado a 35 milicianos y atacado varios de sus escondites
6985828 siamo assolutamente certi che vinceremo la guerra perch abbiamo il sostegno pi grande di tutti dio i nostri nemici ripongono una fiducia totale negli equipaggiamenti materiali e non hanno il morale saldo necessario per vincere la guerra perch non sono motivati dalla religione
6985829 sempre pi sanguinosa quando le truppe americane si inoltreranno nelle nostre zone e nei nostri villaggi
6985830 la nostra guerra una jihad continua non finir con le elezioni o con altri eventi meramente spettacolari continuer finch necessario finch non daremo un governo puramente islamico allafganistan
6985831 oggi lafganistan soffre di un livello di insicurezza specialmente nel sud e in parte dellest come non si vedeva dalla partenza dei talebani
6985832 vi sono segnali preoccupanti che i talebani rimanenti e altri gruppi estremisti si stanno riorganizzando
6985833 c sicuramente pi violenza e ci sono elementi violenti che cercano di tornare alla ribalta
6985834 credo che questa situazione rester difficile per un po di tempo ma c una forte presenza internazionale e una forte presenza americana adeguate per affrontare la violenza
6985835 approviamo gli attacchi talebani contro gli americani ma la loro decapitazione e luccisione degli afgani e degli ulema studiosi religiosi non in linea con le caratteristiche degli afgani
6985836 i talebani hanno portato pace e sicurezza al paese ed erano i nostri figli
6985837 not many technology companies have succeeded in mobilizing an army of
6985838 abbiamo pi contatti con la gente che non con il governo perch da essa che dipendiamo per il pane quotidiano
6985839 molti dei miei amici sono andati in pakistan lo scorso anno
6985840 hanno imparato molto e le strutture l sono migliori che qui
6985841 gran parte dei miei amici si sono uniti ai talebani o ad al qaeda dopo la laurea
6985842 molti studenti religiosi si sono uniti ai talebani perch non sono sicuri di poter trovare lavoro in afganistan
6985843 ho chiesto alla mia famiglia ma non mi hanno dato il permesso quindi sono tornato in afganistan
6985844 gli studenti religiosi vivono come barboni in afganistan colpa del governo se finiscono per allearsi con i talebani o con al qaeda
6985845 stiamo pensando di aggiungere uneducazione moderna e lo studio di lingue straniere alla religione
6985846 vogliamo che i nostri studenti siano afgani migliori oltre che musulmani migliori i nostri studenti avranno comunque libert negli studi il governo non eserciter alcuna pressione su di loro
6985847 i diplomi dati agli studiosi dopo la laurea sarano accettati da paesi esteri e non solo in afganistan
6985848 studiamo per 15 20 anni nelle scuole religiose afgane per riceverne un diploma che non accettato neanche in tutto lafganistan
6985849 siamo accettati come maulawi studiosi religiosi solo da colleghi che ci conoscono per aver studiato con noi
6985850 i nostri laureati non solo lavoreranno nelle moschee ma avranno anche lopportunit di ottenere un lavoro in organizzazioni governative una volta ottenuto il diploma delle scuole religiose locali
6985851 stiamo cercando di trattenere gli studenti religiosi in modo che non vadano in paesi vicini dove sono esposti a idee politiche differenti essenziale per la sicurezza dellafganistan
6985852 siamo molto lieti perch questa la prima volta nella storia dellafganistan che le scuole religiose rientreranno nel programma del governo
6985853 le scuole religiose non hanno ricevuto per niente gli aiuti in denaro giunti in afganistan dallestero e gli studiosi sono stati marginalizzati quindi sia gli studiosi sia gli studenti hanno perso fede nel governo
6985854 non so proprio quando sar costruita la nostra scuola provinciale ma sono molto lieto che in afganistan siano costruite scuole religiose non sarei andato in pakistan se avessi saputo che ci sarebbe stata una scuola nel nostro distretto ma non posso lasciare la mia madrassa attuale finch le cose non saranno pi chiare
6985855 il vero obiettivo del governo di usare la madrassa per una politica antipachistana
6985856 se ii governo vuole sinceramente ricostruire le scuole religiose e non usarle in modo errato i nostri studenti religiosi non lasceranno il paese ma mi sembra improbable che il governo stia agendo onestamente
6985857 ci sono combattimenti nel sud e dicono che le radici della violenza sono in pakistan il governo quindi obbligato ad attuare una politica risolutiva
6985858 over the last several months we have had discussions with a number of financial institutions about a number of combinations including ci and its subsidiaries
6985859 were always talking to everybody we have knocked on every single door in canada theres never been a door we havent knocked on
6985860 we really believe its important to take advantage of the scale that this business offers and in a business thats dominated by a few big players you want to be big and bring down your costs
6985861 simply put canadas larger financial institutions typically dont share their toys well with others
6985862 consumers are concerned with the environment and want to be associated with brands that are too with nvohk members have the opportunity to make critical decisions that not only affect the direction of the brand but also make a positive impact on the world around them

6985865 there is no reason why we cannot stay in budget
6985866 the olympic village will not be short changed and in fact it will be senseless to economise here as the legacy of 2900 3000 affordable housing is key to the whole project
6985867 there are issues with the ioc and the sanctity of the ioc brand
6985868 its an amazing shift from complaining about costs to now complaining that we will have a skin flint games

6985882 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6985883 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6985884 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6985885 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6985886 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6985887 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6985888 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6986307 this is what we all dreamed about four years getting back to this point
6986308 we havent done anything yet weve got one more game to go
6986309 when we played the usa last time we did a terrible job
6986310 i dont know the odds that well win but i am sure that the same thing wont happen again
6986311 we know we have very few chances but we have chances
6986312 we are not satisfied with the silver medal we will look forward to the gold
6986313 the game plan was to get in our heads rattle us up out there and i think we did a hell of a job just keeping our composure
6986314 they wanted to play physical and we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game
6986315 im pretty sure yall got a chance the chance is 50 50 right now
6986316 evidemment la question la plus importante est est ce que la personne num ro deux sur le
6986317 je veux quelquun qui soit capable de mettre mes id es l preuve et qui ne soit pas un simple b ni oui oui
6986318 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1000 metres i have put together in years
6986319 reasonable compromise that will soften the impact to family budgets
6986320 some boys should wear caution signs that say capable of breaking hearts because some people find that out that out the hard way
6986321 we use local farmers on tractors to move equipment but the amount of red diesel involved is a drop in the ocean compared to people who are knowingly doing it illegally
6986322 the rebated oil scheme is specifically to support the production of food in the agricultural and horticultural industry and tractors used for non agricultural purposes do not qualify
6986323 an agricultural show is not an agricultural enterprise as such but a profit making business outside the scheme
6986324 like babes wonderful nude girls well play a nice memory game
6986325 she hasnt said a word about it but lisa deserves everything that comes to her
6986326 shes been such a great leader and role model everyone on this team we grew up watching her play i remember my first wnba game was at the great western forum watching her this year has been closure in a lot of ways
6986327 the way lisa handles her business sets a great example for the youngsters who are here now and hopefully theyll spread similar lessons to the people who come after
6986328 thats why the womens side has been so consistent we try to impart the importance of a long term commitment on the ones who are here for the first time
6986329 lisas been playing a long time thats not easy its not for everybody the sacrifices you make with time away training games years and years that takes a lot of pride
6986330 i will have done all i can do to represent my country for the four olympics and two or three world championships
6986331 i have to be both mother and father to my children why would i blow myself up
6986332 in the vein of highlander but i like the casting choice i felt bad for mckidd when
6986333 vores unders gelse har vist at n rrebro skiller sig markant ud med langt flere andelsboliger til salg end de andre kvarterer samtidig kan vi generelt se at s lgerne giver et stort afslag i prisen n r de annoncerer de her andelsboliger men de er stadig sv re at komme af med
6986334 the multi of egypt dr farid wasil disclosed that the world health organization who awarded his dar al ifta for the fatwa religious decree that declared
6986335 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
6986336 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsc member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday
6986337 is a necessary step for cooperation between india and the nsg we look forward to working with them
6986338 o uvanje teritorijalnog integriteta gruzije nemogu e je bez internacionalizacije mirovnih snaga
6986339 so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition
6986340 tinker tailor soldier sailor rich man poor man beggar man thief doctor lawyer indian chief
6986341 that food has always been and will continue to be the basis for one of our greater snobbisms does not explain the fact that the attitude toward the food choice of others is becoming more and more heatedly exclusive until it may well turn into one of those forms of bigotry against which gallant little committees are constantly planning campaigns in the cause of justice and decency
6986342 i just wanted to say that im sorry i dont know if i did the right thing or not but i love you and i cant stay without you cant sleep without hearing you thats why i messaged miss you goodnight
6986343 the f 150 powerforce set up a generation of design dna for ford trucks
6986344 was made a little larger than life in all directions
6986345 we all came in there having one goal and that was to prove everyone wrong
6986346 i believe that by going 11 0 and blowing everybody out we showed that washington does produce football talent and that were one of the best in the country i dont understand why everyone thinks we dont it just drives me crazy
6986347 every ball he throws is right to the receiver he never forces anything
6986348 we walked in and we all had the same shirt on we were looking real fresh
6986349 they just busted out laughing thinking this washington team is a bunch of goofy kids but it was a bit of a shock to them when we came out and did the things that we did
6986350 a this ticket is in mint condition for being almost 30 years old first opened you needed a ticket for each ride or attraction a magic key coupon ticket was good for all be purchased by the general public you had to be a magic kingdom club member got you on the best rides attractions like pirates of the caribbean its a small world monorail to disney world hotel the enchanted tiki room smallest of the key tickets and measures 2 1 4
6986351 the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6986352 ive heard nothing from arsene wenger himself so it is strange i read his comments and i just thought they were strange bizarre really
6986353 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
6986354 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6986355 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
6986356 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
6986357 i am aware of allegations regarding child trafficking and share concerns for the safety of children adopted from overseas mr mcclelland said
6986358 i have asked my department to make direct contact with the indian authorities and provide me with a brief on any potential legal issues arising in india and australia
6986359 i will ensure that any matters arising are duly acted upon by my department and where relevant are passed on for states and territories to implement
6986360 the department advises me that theyve done a very thorough investigation into those 23 cases from india and that there is currently only one case that they are continuing to investigate ms keech said
6986361 i have since also asked for another in depth audit of all of those 23 cases involved
6986362 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over dr nelson said
6986363 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
6986364 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped dr nelson told reporters in adelaide today
6986365 if youre doing something like image processing we can demonstrate six to seven times speed ups and we can probably double those
6986366 if youre doing a tight programming loop thats just manipulating bits you can go 20 to 40 times faster
6986367 what were trying to do is extend the capability of the browser
6986368 if browsers are only doing javascript and doing it slowly we worry that content will migrate to closed platforms like silverlight
6986369 those platforms that are not a browser are an increasingly thin value add to what the browser can do
6986370 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
6986371 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
6986372 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home
6986373 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
6986374 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
6986375 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
6986376 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
6986377 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
6986378 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game
6986379 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain

6986386 anti intervention campaigners in alice springs have today argued that a lack of confidence amongst aboriginal people in the political process has contributed to the historically low voter turn out in the nt government elections
6986387 many aboriginal people voted labor in the federal election because of what howard and brough did to us with the intervention but in the last 12 months neither the new rudd government or nt labor have done anything to reverse these destructive policies in fact they continue to push them on us
6986388 the intervention resistance action group irag from alice springs is challenging candidates in the upcoming nt election to speak out against the destructive effects of the intervention criticising nt labors commitment of 280million to continue the intervention for another four years
6986389 having witnessed first hand something of the state of education for aboriginal children in the northern territory we can make two fundamental points basic educational facilities for aboriginal people are a national scandal and the nt intervention now being extended by the rudd government is drastically worsening this state of affairs
6986390 this week we find out more about the new multimedia dance work called groundup by bernadette walong and we hear from walter shaw a resident at the mt nancy town camp in alice springs who is the subject of a new documentary
6986391 linking welfare payments to school attendance in indigenous communities is destined to fail because it ignores the underlying reasons children stay away from classes health problems and a lack of basic facilities
6986392 the next stage of welfare reform in indigenous communities starts today in a hall in coen on cape york when the families responsibilities commission sits for the first time the commission will have the power to take away welfare benefits from people failing to send their children to school abusing their children or trashing their homes
6986393 aboriginal people are healthier happier and cost governments less money when they are living on their traditional lands according to new research but the federal intervention taskforce has called on the rudd government to consider the long term viability of homeland settlements it advocated assessing the sustainability of smaller communities and only those deemed viable given access to services such as schools and health clinics
6986394 arnhem land leader galarrwuy yunupingu has called for the abolition of the federal governments longstanding aboriginal employment scheme labelling it a welfare trap that is
6986395 an independent candidate for the northern territory seat of barkly says some aboriginal people went without food for days and in some cases weeks during the transition to income management randall gould says income management has been a shambles in the barkly since it was rolled out at the beginning of april as part of the commonwealth intervention
6986396 thousands of aboriginal people are petitioning to have the northern territory intervention abandoned activists say their petition will be tabled in federal parliament in mid september to coincide with the end of the rudd governments 12 month review into radical measures to combat child sex abuse organisers of the petition have warned that labor is at risk of repeating the mistakes of the howard government
6986397 the federal intervention into aboriginal communities would not have happened if northern territory politicians had made resourcing police a priority their union says

6986404 what i was attempting to be but not very artfully was complimentary
6986405 you can have a rotating storm but until you have rain you don t get a tornado
6986406 the hook echo is usually thought to be a passive feature of tornadoes
6986407 i m saying it s not passive it s an active mechanism for tornado formation
6986408 but until these things are seen more conclusively out in the field it s not at all clear whether rain is involved in the formation of most tornadoes a few or none at all
6986409 the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
6986410 the big problem was keeping the markers in place the little ones kept on pulling them off with their trunks
6986411 im fighting for my life i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world but i have to be realistic and face the possibility that i may not live to see them grow up
6986412 i cant face telling my boys because they are so young they think mummy has a tummy ache
6986413 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6986414 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6986415 i don t think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over so let s just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems generally speaking government is the problem not the solution
6986416 i ask the nepalese army police armed police and the national investigation department to forget the bitter past born out of the conflict and urge them to forge national unity and move ahead
6986417 i assure them that there will be no prejudices or bias against them
6986418 the new governments main responsibility is to complete the peace process and draft a new constitution within the next two years
6986419 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socioeconomic issues such as poverty unemployment and other problems and we will work to bring about a modern industrial economy for which a private public partnership model will be followed
6986420 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6986421 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6986422 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6986423 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6986424 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished

6986428 those military values are great for teaching you dont get that in the civilian world
6986429 i tell my students to use me as an example i wont ridicule a person i dont cuss its imbedded in me and i carry that into the classroom
6986430 i didnt want them to use my deployment as an excuse not to pay attention
6986431 when i went into her office i pulled a chair up to her desk and she knew it was something important
6986432 the principal was the hardest to tell the rest of the teachers found out after that
6986433 in each class after i called the roll i told them i was leaving and that i was coming back here
6986434 leaving the school was really hard this time because i was really into what i was doing
6986435 the students i got along well with dont know how to keep a secret
6986436 one of the math teachers has a band and he played a rendition of proud to be an american
6986437 some of the students wrote poems they had a slide show it was very touching
6986438 when i found out i was getting deployed we had almost daily administrative team meetings
6986439 i had to come up with a plan then i figured out a way to tell my staff
6986440 i dont want the teachers coming to me with things they should be going to my assistant principal with
6986441 i dont let students give excuses for why they dont have a particular assignment done i share some of my experiences with the students ive been around the world and have managed to get the job done and come home

6986456 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
6986457 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
6986458 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
6986459 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
6986460 and he was like dont worry mon we got this one
6986461 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
6986462 id love for this to be a spark for the decathlon
6986463 the other girls were angry with nobuhle because she had decided not to have children now and all the parents held her up as an example
6986464 it made the other girls who already have children look bad
6986465 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6986466 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6986467 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6986468 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6986469 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6986470 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6986471 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6986472 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6986528 we want them to know that even though theyre gone theyre still a member of the organization and will be when they get back
6986529 when youre deployed overseas you want to know there is a real world back home and you stay grounded in the insanity that youre doing by remembering that theres a reason behind it and its your family and your coworkers and your friends and everybody else
6986530 so its important we do the e mail it keeps them connected with that real world
6986531 theyre good experienced candidates that usually fit well into the training scheme
6986532 they come with a great set of work ethics that kind of sets an example for others to follow

6986537 there is a moral issue here we are here to provide not only law enforcement but justice
6986538 some people talk of fears of terrorizing immigrant communities but if youre not involved in criminal activity youll probably never come in contact with these programs

6986541 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6986542 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6986543 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6986544 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6986545 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6986546 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections

6986553 well never be able to describe how honored we feel to be a part of this project
6986554 were just very humbled and want to give our thanks to the hundreds of people who worked on the design team
6986555 were fortunate enough not to have lost anybody on that day
6986556 it was just the atmosphere from that day it was filled with such sorrow and it was such a negative time we just wanted to contribute something positive thats the idea of why we entered the competition
6986557 the design had to be like no other because 9 11 was a day like no other
6986558 we wanted it to capture the magnitude of the events that played out that day
6986559 its a challenge to be the first ones out here with it ch 47f and were still learning a lot of its capabilities and still developing how we are using the aircraft
6986560 as far as its enhanced capabilities it gives us great situational awareness of where were at and makes our jobs a lot easier it really enhances our performance and so far it has been great
6986561 we provide a service you cant get anywhere else in a heavy lift capacity we can move more cargo more efficiently and a lot safer than it takes to ground haul the equipment
6986562 there are small forward operating bases and contingency operating bases out there that need small parts pieces and whatever we can take them and it is our responsibility to get them what they need
6986563 the biggest difference with the aircraft is the avionics once the pilots are trained and proficient it takes a lot of the mission planning and simplifies it
6986564 essentially the entire aircraft has been upgraded to incorporate the newest digital systems and because of these systems the management of our missions is incredibly easy
6986565 our mission is to move people and cargo from one place to another this encompasses the movement of coalition troops resupplying various forward operating bases just about anything the soldiers need we will bring to them
6986566 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
6986567 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them
6986568 we hope the rebels are reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals

6986573 in a real life scenario the squad would have called for fire first in order to suppress the enemy
6986574 but in this case flanking the enemy was the only real way
6986575 we feed off each others energy we look to each other for strength
6986576 it is very hard to spot the enemy out of the corner of your eye
6986577 i went through slow kept my eyes open and had just a little bit of luck
6986578 a hell burst of lead down range at the targets
6986579 this tactic provides the most firepower possible to suppress a much larger enemy allowing for retreat
6986580 it was a good week we learned together we trained together and we had fun together thats a bilateral exercise
6986581 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6986582 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces

6986612 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
6986613 i was just trying to play the game they were just down there trying to be physical i was trying to be physical back with them
6986614 it was a little bit chirpy out there but nothing personal nothing major they were trying to win and we were trying to win

6986618 between the centro the 800w and the pro we have a great story in the last year
6986619 were very excited about where weve come from and where were going
6986620 everybody whether theyre the it purchaser the ceo or the person who works in the mailroom theyre also consumers and so aesthetics are absolutely important
6986621 fundamentally most of the old treos were sticking with an old design paradigm the pro is a professional version of the centro

6986623 is the pro a breakthrough like the iphone 3g no but its a solid offering that gets palm in the game

6986642 este torneo tuvo mucho nivel nosotros le ganamos a estados unidos y a china en la ronda preliminar y esos dos equipos luego nos vencieron si tuvi ramos que enfrentarlos de nuevo no s si les podr amos ganar
6986643 luego de ganarle 3 0 a estados unidos nos confiamos demasiado a n cuando el equipo de coaches hicimos lo posible por no permitirlo se cre un ambiente de confianza excesiva y luego de la derrota ante estados unidos eso se traslad al partido contra china
6986644 nos fall el aspecto ofensivo el bloqueo y el recibo todo se cay y por eso lucimos mal contra china y los estados unidos
6986645 a group of pro life activists will get arrested perhaps more than once in order to draw focus to obamas hard core support of child killing we will definitely be arrested on tuesday august 26 at a location to be announced and perhaps sooner
6986646 we are taking our cues from the letter from the birmingham jail by martin luther king jr we are deliberately creating social tension in order to highlight the grave evil of legalized child killing those who condemn our tactics might forgo celebrating marin luther king day
6986647 espero que con estas tres finales y con las pruebas que han visto se den cuenta de que colombia tiene mucho potencial y en medell n tenemos un equipo muy grande no es una negligencia de nosotros sino que en realidad necesitamos una piscina cubierta para poder entrenar y mejorar nuestros saltos

6986661 labor day differs in every essential way from the other holidays of the year in any country

6986670 there is the very real threat that foreign direct investment in countries that make up the former soviet bloc could severely decrease
6986671 as russia exerts its military force in georgia the kremlin sends a thinly veiled message to neighbouring territories indicating that prime minister putin and the soviet government will not shy away from military force in order to protect local interests and its regional sphere of influence
6986672 with western investors seeking to mitigate any further potential risk through civil unrest and business disruption the recent conflict in georgia demonstrates the fragile political balance within the region and demonstrates russias economic muscle within the wider european economy

6986690 es una crisis de un modo de desarrollo espec fico que sin dar lugar a un cambio de modo de producci n capitalista introdujo de lleno a la econom a en un per odo incierto de transici n
6986691 crear las condiciones y dar lugar a un nuevo r gimen de acumulaci n
6986692 si bien los precios de los productos agropecuarios se han elevado debido al incremento de la demanda externa una especializaci n exportadora centrada en productos primarios poco manufacturados constituye una amenaza
6986693 genera un sendero de crecimiento dif cil de revertir y puede revitalizarse la tendencia secular al deterioro de los t rminos del intercambio
6986694 el programa econ mico basado en una sola medida heterodoxa tipo de cambio real alto ya ha rendido todos sus frutos
6986695 este mecanismo por s s lo no est en condiciones de resolver las numerosas dificultades y desaf os que presenta el proceso de crecimiento argentino y que hoy amenazan con detenerlo
6986696 ha sido incapaz de guiar a la econom a argentina en el salto desde un proceso de mera expansi n a un proceso de transformaci n estructural basado en una firme industrializaci n
6986697 esta es la verdadera oportunidad que la econom a argentina podr a estar perdi ndose
6986698 una estrategia nacional de desarrollo con una ampliaci n sustancial del alcance de las pol ticas estatales
6986699 construir una senda de crecimiento de largo plazo que haga eje en el aumento de la productividad y la competitividad genuina de la econom a nacional

6986707 la informalidad laboral contin a siendo elevada la fuerte creaci n de empleo en el sector formal desde 2003 no alcanza a resolver el problema de la informalidad y la precariedad laboral ya que todav a existe una amplia franja de trabajadores en negro que se estima en torno del 37 3 por ciento del total de los asalariados
6986708 entre los sectores con mayor proporci n de empleo no registrado se destacan el agro el servicio dom stico el comercio y la construcci n con gran disparidad a nivel regional mientras que en el noa noroeste y nea noreste la informalidad laboral alcanza a casi la mitad de los trabajadores en la patagonia el empleo en negro se reduce a la mitad
6986709 el fin de fiesta de la corrupci n no pueden pagarlo los argentinos

6986711 resulta inconcebible que el estado argentino se haga cargo de la deuda de una empresa espa ola

6986714 si nos acercamos a otros con los que tenemos m s diferencias que con felipe c mo no vamos a hablar con l
6986715 la independencia de la magistratura fue designada tras la dictadura fascista para evitar el uso pol tico de la justicia
6986716 por fin no tendr que pasar los s bados con los abogados para preparar las audiencias de los juicios y podr utilizarlos para trabajar para el pa s
6986717 valorizar los que son serios y que hacen su trabajo en modo concienzudo y con esp ritu de sacrificio
6986718 hay que ser delicados en citar ideas de quienes ya no est n y no pueden replicar
6986719 es como el diablo que habla de agua bendita falcone ha combatido la mafia berlusconi en muchas ocasiones ha coqueteado con mafiosos
6986720 aunque nunca precis c mo al ser eso una tarea exclusiva del parlamento
6986721 hubo negligencia en el accidente sabemos que muchos quisieron bajar y no los dejaron
6986722 tenemos mensajes de texto que muestran que hubo una especie de mot n a bordo para que el vuelo no saliera
6986723 hubo negligencia tenemos testigos muchos de nosotros recibimos llamadas de nuestros familiares o mensajes que dec an que algo raro pasaba
6986724 le pido como ciudadano que el gobierno al que hemos votado nos proteja tenemos mensajes que muestran que hubo una especie de mot n a bordo para que el vuelo no saliera ustedes tienen que protegernos de tiburones econ micos que son los bancos o las compa as como sta que han asesinado a los nuestros
6986725 una falla del motor no es causa de un accidente eso est de sobra contemplado en todas las normas junto con otras causas puede ser que tumbe el avi n habr que determinar el conjunto de causas que han concurrido
6986726 el piloto detect algo cuando se llev el avi n de la pista
6986727 calentamiento excesivo en una toma de aire que alimenta algunos sistemas del avi n
6986728 el t cnico que revis el avi n no pudo reparar el sistema
6986729 el accidente pudo ser fortuito e impredecible con lo cual las gestiones judiciales ir an encaminadas a procurar que las familias de las v ctimas reciban una indemnizaci n pero por el contrario pudo haber existido tambi n una negligencia si se autoriz la salida del avi n sin haber reparado adecuadamente la aver a de la que avis la luz que se encendi en la cabina est claro que hay una responsabilidad penal
6986730 a veces dar a la impresi n de que la presidenta est desequilibrada o anda medio mal de la cabeza
6986731 la simbiosis patol gica del matrimonio presidencial en el ejercicio del poder
6986732 un l der del movimiento agropecuario y la causa del campo argentino
6986733 no estoy solo ya que hay muchos compa eros an nimos
6986734 todo eso que dice reafirma su humildad usted viene teniendo un papel protag nico y nos sentimos contentos de que eso ocurra porque hacen falta m s argentinos como usted
6986735 consensuar una pol tica con las entidades en el tema de la agricultura la ganader a y la lecher a
6986736 para que el pa s resurja hace falta m s nacionalismo
6986737 creo que s el nacionalismo de estar comprometidos con la patria para el bien de todos los argentinos tenemos que pensar que todos los argentinos tengan trabajo digno no sacarle a los ricos para darle a los pobres sino educaci n y buenos sueldos para todos
6986738 orgulloso como argentino al escucharlo en la arenga en la ruta 14
6986739 la causa del campo es fundamentalmente una causa patri tica y nacional
6986740 la situaci n es ca tica es una verg enza la pobre gente no tiene posibilidad de acceder en c rdoba a los anticonceptivos
6986741 nos dijeron que hab a llegado el barco con los insumos a la aduana y nos dijeron que apenas la anmat libere la mercader a estar an llegando los m todos anticonceptivos durante la semana que se inicia as que estamos a la espera
6986742 se produjeron faltantes en todos los servicios para el a o pr ximo vamos a presupuestar los insumos del programa provincial de salud reproductiva para evitar que se repita esta situaci n
6986743 a fines de a o comenz el problema pero se fue agravando en lo que va de ste en 2006 distribuimos en la provincia 360 mil blisters de anticonceptivos orales y este a o nos inform naci n que no se comprometen a entregarnos ni la mitad de esa cantidad ya no tenemos m s p ldoras anticonceptivas para entregar a las mujeres
6986744 yo lo respeto much simo he aprendido mucho de econom a con l
6986745 no estamos perdiendo leche hoy incluso el consumo interno ha crecido este a o ya est en los niveles pre crisis
6986746 a veces se quieren buscar soluciones generales cuando no es lo mismo la problem tica de los tambos peque os de buenos aires entre r os c rdoba o la pampa
6986747 la intenci n es buscar una soluci n que supere el tema precios que apunte a mejoras tecnol gicas y aumentos de productividad
6986748 hay gente que gana mucha plata y otros que no les va tan bien los costos de producci n son muy diferentes hay que mejorar la eficiencia de los tambos m s chicos presionan porque sembrando soja ganan m s
6986749 ten amos una propuesta concreta para hacer pero en estos ltimos 20 d as el precio internacional de la leche se vino al piso hoy sigue siendo un precio muy bueno pero ayer se cerraron algunos negocios de 3500 d lares la tonelada y eso implica que la relaci n cambi significativamente
6986750 yo no lo veo como un inconveniente para nosotros al contrario estamos acordando lo que hay que acordar
6986751 despu s de la gran primera fase que hicimos ganando los cinco partidos que disputamos el cuarto puesto nos sabe a poco y ahora estamos un poco decepcionadas
6986752 no hemos estado del todo concentradas porque la derrota ante estados unidos nos hizo mucho da o todo nos sali mal en ese partido cometimos muchos errores en todos los aspectos del juego y moralmente salimos muy mal
6986753 china jug un gran partido y es cierto que nosotras volvimos a cometer errores importantes vuelvo a repetir que la derrota ante estados unidos nos afect bastante y no conseguimos reponernos del todo aunque lo intentamos con todas nuestras fuerzas
6986754 ha sido una pena porque al final todo se perdi
6986755 estoy un poco triste porque era mi ltima carrera y no hice un buen puesto
6986756 como la dureza de las subidas y la importancia del fondo f sico
6986757 s que tengo el motor pero me falta la t cnica
6986758 hice muchas cosas por la bicicleta de monta a en brasil y ahora quiero fijarme otros objetivos creo que hay que dar paso a la nueva generaci n a chicas j venes
6986759 en la bicicleta de monta a no lo puedes controlar todo
6986760 este equipo se reconstruy de nuevo hace tan solo a o y medio despu s de una serie de malos resultados en este tiempo hemos estado ascendiendo en el panorama internacional y haber llegado aqu hasta las semifinales es un gran m rito
6986761 sab amos que pod a pasar cualquier cosa en los juegos ol mpicos y que luchar amos por los seis primeros puestos salvo brasil que est un poco por encima del resto de equipos hay una gran igualdad entre todos
6986762 sin duda cometimos muchos errores t cticos y de concentraci n cometimos todos los errores que no hicimos antes en la primera fase en los cinco primeros partidos ganamos confianza y seguridad pero lo perdimos todo de golpe ante estados unidos en la semifinal no nos sali nada
6986763 china jug muy bien hizo un gran partido y nuestras chicas estuvieron m s combativas que ante estados unidos pero volvieron a cometer demasiados errores sobre todo en defensa y recepci n
6986764 el cuarto puesto en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n no es como el oro que hemos conseguido en otras ocasiones pero no es nada desde able es un buen resultado para cuba
6986765 tuve una ca da al principio se cay la china intent esquivarla y otra corredora me choc ca fuerte y me golpe en la rodilla la costilla la mano y se me sali la cadena
6986766 las condiciones fueron muy dif ciles dur simas tanto del circuito con unas cuestas muy empinadas como por el calor
6986767 contenta con su primera experiencia ol mpica pero descontenta por haber tenido una ca da en un campeonato tan importante
6986768 si no es por la ca da pod a haberlo logrado incluso entre las 15
6986769 con tanto entrenamiento y competici n no he podido hacerlo al menos quiero ver la gran muralla
6986770 buscate una c mara acu tica porque ah vas a terminar sacando fotos
6986771 las ventas estuvieron acompa adas de poco volumen se oper s lo 511 millones de pesos la mitad que en d as atr s lo que significa que ya no quedan vendedores que quieran deshacerse de sus t tulos a cualquier precio y el actual es un buen piso
6986772 hay que romper la desigualdad de las zonas m s alejadas
6986773 hay que comenzar a hablar sin eufemismos hay una argentina rica y una argentina pobre y el gran desaf o es poner en marcha esa argentina pobre
6986774 cuando uno recorre el pa s profundo puede conocer en serio a los peque os productores agropecuarios y comprende entonces la diversidad y la complejidad de un pa s tan desigual en sus regiones
6986775 es el gran desaf o de la dirigencia nacional en la rep blica argentina romper la desigualdad de de las zonas mas desfavorecidas
6986776 en santiago del estero tenemos una econom a de subsistencia pero ahora tendremos una oportunidad de mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestro pueblo con la recuperaci n de 400 mil hect reas productivas
6986777 tuvimos anuncios que no esper bamos como el acueducto del oeste que nos permite hablar de recuperar miles de hect reas para la ganader a
6986778 los chinos se prepararon muy bien para estos juegos ol mpicos
6986779 no entramos en los juegos como favoritos los chinos nos dar n una buena patada en el trasero
6986780 los chinos est n orgullosos de lo que hemos logrado
6986781 tienen buenas atletas y un buen sistema deportivo por eso no tienen la necesidad de enga ar
6986782 con la intenci n de eliminar total o parcialmente a un grupo nacional y en consecuencia forman parte del genocidio ocurrido en la argentina
6986783 el genocidio est incorporado a la constituci n nacional porque la argentina ratific la convenci n internacional sobre genocidio y se incluy en la reforma de 1994
6986784 se debe definir la descripci n de la conducta en s misma es bastante complicado
6986785 tenemos algo que se le parece que es el homicidio agravado por motivos de odio racial o religioso
6986786 la menci n del genocidio en nuestro contexto es dificultosa de usar desde el punto de vista de los documentos internacionales
6986787 me cuesta mucho encontrar una definici n de grupo protegido para lo que sucedi en la argentina encuentro mucho m s aplicable otras definiciones de delitos de lesa humanidad que existen en el derecho internacional que son el escal n de ah muy cerca del genocidio
6986788 reaccionar con violencia es una caracter stica com n de ciertas ciudades que tienen un n mero muy elevado de cr menes
6986789 haza a gramatical de ltima generaci n capaz de hacer mutar una categor a nunca al azar psicol gica en diatriba de cabotaje
6986790 si no pueden renuncien pero no sigan ocupando las oficinas de gobierno no sigan recibiendo un sueldo por no hacer nada que eso tambi n es corrupci n
6986791 esto se ha agravado en muchos casos debido a la penetraci n de la delincuencia en los rganos de seguridad y a la complicidad de algunas autoridades con los criminales en muchos casos la delincuencia ha da ado el tejido social y ha encontrado cobijo en familias enteras y comunidades
6986792 no era la medalla que quer amos pero estamos muy contentos de haber logrado el bronce y poder subir al podio
6986793 todo el equipo demostr hoy la clase que tiene al superar una derrota tan frustrante como la que se dio ante cuba
6986794 cuando fuimos al parlamento explicamos cu l es el objetivo que perseguimos con la ley no est pensada para jorobar a nadie sino para que todas las jubilaciones aumenten si eso no est claro lo escribiremos claro para que se entienda y lo haremos tantas veces como sea necesario para que consensuemos
6986795 la movilidad se aplicar a todos los jubilados y sobre todo el haber
6986796 se har n los cambios que hagan falta para que quede claro
6986797 la totalidad de los haberes quedar n regidos por el nuevo ndice y que se aplicar de manera ntegra sobre la jubilaci n
6986798 fuimos al congreso con el nimo de defender nuestra propuesta pero tambi n a escuchar y a acordar lo que sea necesario vamos a tratar de sacar una ley con el mayor consenso posible
6986799 no est pensada para jorobar a nadie esa es la enorme diferencia con relaci n a todas las leyes jubilatorias que se sancionaron en otro tiempo que eran siempre coartadas par no cumplir
6986800 de m nima van a tener la movilidad que marca esta ley que es mejor que nada pero veremos si atendemos el planteo que han hecho que tal vez se pueda resolver por fuera de la ley con alguna f rmula a trav s de seguridad social ellos dicen que en el futuro podr an subir los salarios de los docentes m s que el resto si se incorporaran las sumas no remunerativas

6986803 de no llegar a un acuerdo entre el gobierno y marsans la expropiaci n podr a ser una posibilidad
6986804 tal como sali el proyecto de la c mara de diputados me parece una evoluci n de lo que se present originalmente esto nos permiti volver a tener la mayor a de los votos incluso nos apoya el sector de los radicales k
6986805 las cosas no se votan a libro cerrado hab a que sacar un proyecto factible algo dif cil de hacer luego del cimbronazo que represent la ca da de las retenciones m viles
6986806 es probable que con los n meros sobre la mesa la votaci n sea m s re ida
6986807 hay que ver si es cierta la deuda total y la exigible 900 millones de d lares y 240 millones respectivamente hay que ver qu pasar cuando aparezcan bien los n meros todav a existen muchas cosas para cerrar
6986808 lo que hay que pagarles es el resultado de la tasaci n menos el endeudamiento

6986815 urged us to take a look at it and come up with a honest review the overall impression is good even if is too early to objectively compare some long term results however it makes more sense than a lot of weight loss hypes we found out on the internet full review
6986816 there is no such thing as a good war or a bad peace
6986817 you take the right for the wrong just to get along

6986828 well destroy the old world and build a new one
6986829 there is no question that one of the most likely things that will happen in the next 40 years is that machine and human intelligence will come much closer together
6986830 the ability of humans to communicate with machines and for machines to communicate with humans will get so much better
6986831 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6986832 that machines will be more intelligent than humans is not a question of if or when it will happen the real question is what will it take for us to make it happen
6986833 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6986834 progress in the next 100 years wont be like progress in the last 100 years we are literally watching technology move at an ever increasing pace

6986836 now they are able to reposition the airplanes from the manufacturing facility to their paint shop without getting on an active runway
6986837 this alleviates the possibility of a runway incursion resulting in an accident
6986838 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1000 metres i have put together in years
6986839 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1000 metres i have put together in years
6986840 i dont know what to say im pretty speechless right now
6986841 it felt a little more like a final than the heat did thats for sure were not going to see fast times today but that is just the nature of the wind
6986842 they say that you learn the hard way and this is certainly very hard to take
6986843 i dont think i could have done anymore i just wasnt good enough on the day
6986844 im 19 and there is more to come from me as an athlete but at the moment im hurting my back is sore and i think i have broken my hand
6986845 i put everything into this ive fallen off and got back up fallen off and got back up again
6986846 i could have finished second without a problem but why settle for silver
6986847 i dont train as hard as ive done for a silver this is all about gold for me its gold or nothing ive put my heart and soul into this but i will bounce back in london and show everyone what im made of
6986848 kenny boxed well and i never thought it would be easy
6986849 he was very sharp and he beat me fair and square
6986850 after all i have had with injuries i would have been happy to come away with a medal at the start now i am here i would not settle for it
6986851 i wont say i would be happy to come away with a medal i am gutted
6986852 i feel like i have let all of sunderland down all of them who came over here who wanted me to do so well
6986853 tonys performance was not up to his standard the other night
6986854 i think he was very nervous and he was falling short
6986855 in the first round he was relaxed enough but egan went up a gear and took it away from him
6986856 the aba have been promising us a contract for a long time
6986857 the rubbish in the paper couldnt have come out at a worse time with the three of us in the semi final
6986858 tuve una ca da al principio se cay la china intent esquivarla y otra corredora me choc ca fuerte y me golpe en la rodilla la costilla la mano y se me sali la cadena
6986859 las condiciones fueron muy dif ciles dur simas tanto del circuito con unas cuestas muy empinadas como por el calor
6986860 contenta con su primera experiencia ol mpica pero descontenta por haber tenido una ca da en un campeonato tan importante
6986861 si no es por la ca da pod a haberlo logrado incluso entre las 15
6986862 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6986863 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
6986864 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
6986865 in many cultures it is most commonly but not universally used to indicate agreement acceptance or acknowledgment
6986866 help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
6986867 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
6986868 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
6986869 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
6986870 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
6986871 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
6986872 this has been an absolutely amazing journey something weve he and his coaches been working hard for the last eight years
6986873 we said all along 2008 was the year it was going to happen im so happy that it did
6986874 to be a part of history in the decathlon the thought of some little kid growing up saying he wants to be a decathlete like bryan clay blows my mind
6986875 the goal at the olympic games is to come out and win
6986876 the scores take care of themselves you have to come out at the olympics ready to compete ready to deal with what mother nature has to offer what competitors from other countries have to offer
6986877 there are a few meets we do that are perfect for a decathlon
6986878 thats the type of meet i would expect to break the record at
6986879 we have had an outstanding relationship with osfc our construction manager architect and all contractors
6986880 from the beginning we have had no major issues contractors have worked well together and the quality of workmanship has been outstanding
6986881 we have some issues that still need to be addressed but that happens in any construction project
6986882 the ohio school facilities commission worked with the construction management firm
6986883 and the school district to work out details regarding funding and we came in under budget and the building was completed on time
6986884 chris was dynamite he was on site at 6 30 a m and did not leave until the last contractor left at the end of the day he had an outstanding relationship with each of the contractors and there was mutual respect he was easy going but when he had to be firm he was firm
6986885 for many years the board of trustees of interchurch social services has been looking for a location that would provide ample room for pantry storage administrative offices and the clothes n counters thrift store all under one roof and all on one floor
6986886 the new building will allow us to more efficiently carry out our mission of providing emergency food clothing and financial aid to residents of the mount vernon school district
6986887 it will also provide space for staff meetings and trainings and administrative duties
6986888 i think it could be very nice the new building because we have clients who go over there the east gambier street house and then they come here sometimes at the time were ready to close
6986889 as long as we have plenty of room in the new building thatll be nice and those of us up in years wont have to deal with steps
6986890 they thought the bridge would tow fairly easily theyll brace it so there wont be the threat of collapse
6986891 were trying to make sure its safe for the children by creating a single crossing point and making it more visible
6986892 its been a long time since we have won a home game in the first game of the year
6986893 obviously that its big for our confidence and morale you cant argue about winning a game i dont care how it happens i think we beat a quality opponent
6986894 i had errors i know quarterbacks do but i had more than i wanted
6986895 that is one thing that i set a goal for in the offseason to throw less interceptions we came out and our defense was awesome i got to give them credit our offense gave me time and we made the plays
6986896 ethan is a big boy and he is real fast and smart too
6986897 he is tough and will do whatever you want him to do those isos i run he just looks at me and says follow me and i know in my heart i am going to be safe
6986898 its the first game and we always make mistakes in the first game
6986899 i believe mistakes are going to happen and you just got keep your feet moving our five lineman poured their heart out up there for us they were blocking really good up there i am really happy with them they are what makes the backfield what it is you just got to want it youve got see where you want to go and get there use all your heart and never stop the legs from moving my parents talk to me about that all the time never stop the legs from moving and always push ahead
6986900 our defensive plan worked out and when your offensive is moving the ball and making plays then grandview heights isnt on the field
6986901 it works hand in hand i hope we can score five touchdowns a game i didnt even know that we had five different guys score and probably wouldnt have known until we watched the tape we were calling whatever was there based on what they were trying to do
6986902 our fans last year i get why they really didnt come that much we were 1 4 at home i understand it it is important to get these wins at home a lot of our fans came out tonight and we need that if we get people to come out and support us it fires up the sidelines and gets us that much more motivated
6986903 all you have to do is read yelp reviews to know how many morons there are
6986904 information technology pros will go extinct if they dont start thinking about their jobs differently
6986905 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems
6986906 the intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh this is a content summary only visit my website for full links other content and more jimmy waless unwelcome homecoming the sum of all human knowledge
6986907 any time you win game 1 its a great momentum builder its a great way to start the season
6986908 for us to get a win over here at their field with as many new faces as we have on both sides of the ball this is a huge boost to our confidence
6986909 our kids now realize that we talked a lot about whether we are going to rebuild or reload
6986910 our kids are confident now that were going to reload thats exactly what we needed
6986911 we didnt do very well in any aspect of the game we just didnt get it done we didnt execute we came out flat lost momentum early and never regained it
6986912 we are making some steps to become a better football team
6986913 tonight was a great learning experience for us this was a good football team we played tonight our kids got their eyes opened up a little bit now when i talk about being physical they know what being physical means weve got to see this and learn from it thats that challenge i put to our team tonight if we can do that we can move forward
6986914 he is a great quarterback he makes great reads and is very accurate he proved that tonight
6986915 things took a while but this was the first game of the season
6986916 offensively we wanted to get into sync and be fluid defensively we wanted to fly around the football sometimes the wing t can be tricky we settled down made our adjustments and got after it
6986917 offensively i thought we moved the ball some but we werent able to get the ball into the end zone
6986918 early in the game when we were in short yardage situations i didnt want to go on fourth down there were some times where maybe we could have went for it but i want to give them a longer field as it turned out they gave us a real education tonight
6986919 our game plan every week is to try to score and score fast
6986920 we are a different team this year last year we were a power running team this year we want to spread people out and get our kids into open space
6986921 they did a nice job of spreading the football around
6986922 we could not pressure them at all we tried to come at them from different ways but it all seemed very ineffective against what they were doing tonight they seemed to be on top of us
6986923 one they took out their first team kids then we matched up better with them and i think thats what you saw in the second half
6986924 weve got to be able to elevate our play to go against first team people weve got to become a physical football team and weve got to be able to meet the challenges i know this is a good football team it is a thing where weve got to use this as a education were going to grow from this and be a better football team

6986941 the wit of conversation consists more in finding it in others
6986942 than in showing a great deal yourself he who goes from your conversation pleased with himself and his own wit is perfectly well pleased with you most men had rather please than admire you and seek less to be instructed nay delighted than to be approved and applauded the most delicate pleasure is to please another
6986943 the wit of the company next to the butt of the company
6986944 is the meanest person in it the great duty of conversation is to follow suit as you do at whist if the eldest hand plays the deuce of diamonds let not his next neighbour dash down the king of hearts because his hand is full of honours i do not love to see a man of wit win all the tricks in conversation
6986945 i am surprised that the united states has just one man with a medal
6986946 i score one point in the first round and so it is up to him to come to me

6986950 the adoption issue and its history has never been comprehensively addressed on a national level by the government of south korea
6986951 the main purpose of the national inquiry is to make the first decisive step in the process of documenting the full and complete history of international adoption from south korea
6986952 such an inquiry would rectify and reconcile the past in order to meet a bright collective future it would be a symbol of human dignity and civil justice and an act of human compassion for thousands and thousands of divided and shattered families on the korean peninsula
6986953 portraiture thus put at his disposal a kind of violence inoculated against reproach by posteritys investment in everything he made at least until feminist criticism came along

6986959 een vrijwilliger moet zich vooral goed in zn vel voelen en zelfstandig kunnen werken
6986960 onderkruiperij achterbaksheid geraffineerde stemmingmakerij alles is goed om zichzelf in de schijnwerpers te werken de partijtop blijft hier blind voor trekt de schouders op wanneer iemand aan de alarmbel trekt
6986961 ik hoef mijn politieke idealen niet te verloochenen omdat het partijprogramma van ldd nauw aansluit bij dat van vlaams belang vlaamse onafhankelijkheid gezond rechts boerenverstand een liberale maatschappijvisie met de nodige sociale correcties een correcte en harde aanpak van de criminaliteit een strikt immigratie en asielbeleid het voornaamste verschilpunt is dat ldd dit alles op een aanvaardbare en menselijke manier uitdraagt
6986962 bij de verkiezingen van juni volgend jaar zou ik de tweede plaats krijgen op de limburgse lijst van vlaams belang dat was me toegezegd de tweede plaats is een verkiesbare plaats daarvoor moet ik het dus niet doen
6986963 wat de mensen absoluut moeten weten is dat ik zelf naar jean marie dedecker ben gestapt om de redenen die ik al aanhaalde ik heb hem g n plaats gevraagd hij heeft mij niets beloofd
6986964 men zegt vaak dat ik mensen vraag om over te stappen de waarheid is dat ik nog maar twee keer zelf iemand heb gevraagd georges lenssen nadat ik een signaal had gekregen dat hij misschien wel ge nteresseerd was en de dochter van marleen govaerts ik heb john niet gevraagd hij is naar mij gestapt ik heb n week bedenktijd gevraagd ik wil niet dat ldd een opvangtehuis wordt voor misnoegde parlementsleden die op zoek zijn naar jobzekerheid
6986965 omdat hij na jan peumans misschien wel het hardst werkende vlaams parlementslid is omdat we beiden echte liberalen zijn omdat ik ervan gecharmeerd was dat hij niets vroeg n omdat we met john nu ook in limburg ldd op de kaart zetten

6986968 this is going to be an electrifying fight between two very accomplished competitors
6986969 david heath is a fiery guy who craves the title and i was very happy to get him signed to a multi fight deal but there is no way that someone like emanuel newton who is on a tremendous streak having won seven straight fights can be taken lightly at all whoever wins this fight is going to be very ready to face the champ
6986970 it is impossible to clear how was all my episodes
6986971 there are times when i nearly forget that im not normal as i go to work each day go to the market write out checks for bills the superficial otherness of tattoos and a black punk t shirt are no longer stark lines delineating difference from mainstream society what once was perceived as freakish has been asimilated while the average person in my community will likely not enjoy a rudimentary peni record my appearance doesnt faze them we all know this right the mortgage company never gave a fuck what i looked like only that i paid my bill each month
6986972 the knowledge strategy isnt recognized and labeled as such by its practicioners but it amounts to virtually the only strategy employed by many radicals activists liberals and anti war folks
6986973 i believe that the majority of media products presented to us however entertaining each product may be absolutely do not offer a challenge to this destructive hierarchal racist sexist culture well duh right would stories that look at the world as it is and use imagination for empathy understanding and resistance even sell sure but the fact that they sell contravenes the message

6987035 according to fidelis pointing out bidens own bishops admonishments on the obligation of catholic legislators to protect life and refrain from profaining the eucharist
6987036 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
6987037 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
6987038 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
6987039 my views are totally consistent with catholic social doctrine there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
6987040 there are those who say that catholics should be robots theres a formula and if we dont follow that formula we shouldnt present ourselves for communion on sunday morning says chris korzen executive director of catholics united
6987041 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now

6987046 this moment calls for more than playacting yet obama looks lost without a presidential script
6987047 perhaps this is not a time for a novice spouting grand rhetoric about a new page in history but for someone whos actually read the pages of some old but still relevant books perhaps this is not the time for playacting perhaps it is not the time for body surfing
6987048 mr mccain and mr obama found themselves on the same page in dealing with the current crisis perhaps reflecting the delicacy of the situation

6987051 if the global war on terror has produced one undeniable conclusion
6987052 it is this estimates of u s military capabilities have turned out to be wildly overstated the bush administrations misplaced confidence in the efficacy of american arms represents a strategic misjudgment that has cost the country dearly even in an age of stealth precision weapons and instant communications armed force is not a panacea even in a supposedly unipolar era american military power turns out to be quite limited
6987053 how did it happen that americans so utterly overappraised the utility of military power
6987054 the military and american society had successfully patched up the differences that produced something akin to divorce during the divisive vietnam years
6987055 between what president bush called upon americas soldiers to do and what they were capable of doing loomed a huge gap that defines the military crisis besetting the united states today for a nation accustomed to seeing military power as its trump card the implications of that gap are monumental

6987066 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6987067 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6987068 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6987069 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6987070 the hollywood game that we are in its a cold game

6987074 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6987075 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6987076 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6987077 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6987078 an increased focus on systemwide risks by regulators and supervisors is inevitable and desirable
6987079 we should be careful about over promising as we are still rather far from having the capacity to implement such an approach in a thoroughgoing way
6987080 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6987081 were starting with the largest banks in terms of number of people involved and were working our way down the list
6987082 were now focusing on some of the midsize players in the market

6987086 while affected by drink he developed a morbid interest in trying to gain an insight into what his father was all about
6987087 he tested the waters and wanted to see if he was a paedophile as people had alleged and to gain some understanding of what his father saw in young children

6987091 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating that their funding needs are

6987156 at the end of the day i am going to bloody beat this thing because ive got two amazing kids to live for and theres no way im gonna let them down
6987157 the blood drained from me as my doctor said we have looked again at your biopsy and there are severe abnormalities you need to fly home immediately i looked at the phone in disbelief as he said you have cancer jade its real and its serious i collapsed to the floor thinking my boys oh my god im going to die
6987158 she has serious second stage cancer and needs surgery as soon as possible the cancer is in an advanced stage and was diagnosed in the nick of time the bottom line is if shed stayed in india for the next three months she wouldnt be here
6987159 always the medics told me there was nothing to worry about i feared i was becoming a hypochondriac
6987160 the doctors still insisted they couldnt find anything wrong with me so i insisted on an ultrasound scan but nothing showed up i just got on with my life i thought about cancelling the big brother india trip but they had offered me 100 000 which will go towards bringing up my kids people think im a multi millionaire from telly which couldnt be further from the truth
6987161 with the last agm paving the way for paid selectors the modalities of the new system would be discussed and finalised at the working committee meeting
6987162 don bradmans test average 99 94 runs per dismissal is entrenched in australian folklore and the story of the dons final innings out for a duck when just four runs would have taken his average to 100 has been told countless times just four runs spread over a career of almost 20 years and more than 197 hours at the crease it is worth asking just how sure can we be that the number is correct
6987163 as it happens my recent research has shown that it could be wrong a tantalising clue to four missing runs has been found
6987164 in the scorebook of the epic eight day fifth test of 1928 29 against england in melbourne won by australia by five wickets there is a
6987165 the relevant sections of bill fergusons original score are illustrated there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section maurice tates 35th over there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6987166 perhaps ryder scored them at some other point of the innings perhaps they were not scored at all in which case australia technically did not win the match more importantly perhaps they were scored by bradman just perhaps
6987167 you will not find a scorebook that says bradman scored x when the accepted score is y it is more subtle a batsmans strokes may not add up to his score or more commonly there are mismatches between strokes attributed to batsmen and the strokes marked against bowlers
6987168 there are surviving scorebooks for many tests of the past all but seven of bradmans tests are represented preserved in libraries at lords cricket nsw and elsewhere
6987169 these anomalies are inconclusive there are a number of possible resolutions to the question over ryders four runs in that melbourne test of 1928 29 they are complicated by the presence of an unmarked leg bye
6987170 at least one resolution involves transferring the boundary to bradman
6987171 for pakistan it is better if the tournament is postponed rather than relocated because according to iccs contract with espn star sports it will have to hold the champions trophy within 13 months of its postponement that means that there will be a possibility that this edition of the champions trophy will take place in pakistan next year
6987172 we are ready to hold the champions trophy as we are the alternate venue for the tournament we are in a position to hold the champions trophy as sri lanka is the alternative venue for the icc event

6987175 our position on the issue is that a resolution should be tabled in the parliament monday and after a debate of two days it should be passed wednesday followed by the reinstatement of judges the same day
6987176 we certainly do not desire to part away from the ppp we want the coalition to remain intact
6987177 but the restoration of judges should take place within the next week

6987180 i have conducted operas in the west and it was so troublesome
6987181 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights we do not have that we can work very hard we can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month other than north korea no other country in the world can achieve this
6987182 this kind of uniformity brings beauty we chinese can do it too
6987183 our program had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee
6987184 we dont see any sign by the chinese leadership that it wants to establish genuine political reform its obvious that the party has no intention of accepting any diminution of its monopoly on power
6987185 i totally agree with you the other sprinters like him they dont think hes insulting them jacques rogge should just back off
6987186 we have all the studies that show that when people are interacting and engaged in a show their ad recall rates are much higher
6987187 and they channel surf so much less thats where it really benefits the advertisers

6987197 we know that one in 10 children in any day of the week is on these medicines they are very widely used and they deserve to have modern evidence
6987198 if the evidence is negative then they shouldnt be available
6987199 for children under 12 these medicines were not studied by modern standards
6987200 back in that time there werent special clinical trials in children
6987201 but the new science in children tells us it is actually necessary to study children to be certain we are giving the right dose to measure the side effects and the effectiveness
6987202 we believe these drugs need to be conformed to modern standards
6987203 this is more a continuation of how best to ensure that parents and caregivers are safely and appropriately administering these medicines to children

6987232 we have recently been in contact with crystal not her real name a 21 year old mother of two who has been dancing in a strip club since she was just 15 years old she has experienced her fair share of tragedy and heartache
6987233 about two weeks ago she made the decision to start going to church in her small town where she hoped to develop her relationship with god
6987234 a couple of days ago two women from the church who found out what she does for a living showed up on her doorstep and explained that they did not feel comfortable with this young girl putting her children in childrens ministry with their children
6987235 a few hours later 6 women showed up at her doorstep threatening her the next time you go running to the pastor will be your last
6987236 crystal was overwhelmed with feelings of anger it took everything in her to resist the temptation to turn her anger inward and harm herself she once again called the pastor and his wife who offered their sincere regrets and support
6987237 the next morning crystal woke up to find that her car had been vandalized
6987238 crystal told me that she doesnt want to see anything come in the way of her love of god and her desire to know him
6987239 nobody could none of us can today either they all walked away every single one of them and jesus looked at the woman in her shame and showed her love and mercy
6987240 we are his ambassadors we are his hands and feet how will people know that he is a god of love and grace if we do not show them it is the goodness of god that leads us to change our ways not the condemnation of people
6987241 my heart aches over what this young woman has been going through i wonder if most of us would have the guts to go to church after experiencing something like she has would you could you
6987242 i know that there are many churches many leaders many people throughout this world that are representing the heart of god in a sincere way
6987243 let us never forget that our greatest command is to love god with all of our heart and to love our neighbor as ourselves mark 12 29 31
6987244 ps as i am writing this i just received a call from crystal who just had a chance encounter with a woman who pastors a church with her husband in crystals area knowing nothing about what crystal has been through this week the woman invited crystal to church and encouraged her that it was a safe place for people to come regardless of their lifestyle she mentioned that many of the people have come from backgrounds of addiction and prostitution his love never fails
6987245 we go back and forth i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6987246 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6987247 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
6987248 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6987249 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6987250 but she had with her daughter that morning and was thinking if god forbid something happened to her daughter that someone would come forward and do the right thing
6987251 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me

6987261 she got this really blank look on her face like what does that mean i thought it was a blank look but she was blown away
6987262 that girl called me weeks later and said that tatoo on your back was a sign because i was raised in the church and i know what that means that same girl stopped dancing in the strip club
6987263 if god wants you in there hes picking you know matter what
6987264 i think a lot of girls like me because im the mom who goes in and talks to them when their own mom doesnt
6987265 i had a really low sense of self worth and my identity was strongly intertwined with my sexuality
6987266 she didnt judge me she blew every preconceived notion of what i thought christians were out of the water
6987267 there was a lot of instability in my life and i was looking for a home an anchor
6987268 she never said now that youre going to church you gotta change
6987269 es f llt mir zwar ein bisschen schwer diese zahlen glauben zu k nnen andererseits w rde mich eine derartige entwicklung nicht verwundern wenn der lpreis auf einem hnlich hohen niveau bleibt wie bisher in jedem fall w rde dies nat rlich eine gewaltige steigerung f r die biodiesel branche bedeuten
6987270 die biodiesel produzenten werden von allen seiten in die mangel genommen sei es von der politik den mineral lkonzernen oder der automobilbranche
6987271 die schwierigkeiten f r die biodiesel produzenten sind auch aufgrund der billig exporte etwa aus den usa immens

6987280 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6987281 we will have to see what other issues were present
6987282 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the manoeuvre and have it reviewed
6987283 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6987284 we will have to see what other issues were present
6987285 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6987286 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6987287 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometers 19 miles away i want to be with them
6987288 i think they were thinking too hard about what would happen if they lost in the beginning
6987289 it is very hard to keep the adrenaline down in a match like this
6987290 we didnt seize key moments even though they appeared all the time

6987294 on average they have been asking for a 7 percent increase
6987295 as americans drive less because of the price of gas fewer claims will be filed with insurance companies
6987296 whether this will mean windfall profits for insurers or rate cuts for the consumers is up to governors and state regulators to determine
6987297 a lot of them say we dont regulate rates so we dont care
6987298 higher inflation and the commodities price boom increases the cost of steel plastic paint aluminum copper and everything else used to repair a vehicle
6987299 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6987300 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6987301 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic

6987305 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
6987306 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
6987307 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home
6987308 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
6987309 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
6987310 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
6987311 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
6987312 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
6987313 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game
6987314 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating that their funding needs are
6987315 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6987316 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
6987317 it helped having ruby there not just for warmth but for moral support as well
6987318 it was a great comfort for me knowing she was with him
6987319 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6987320 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6987321 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6987322 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6987323 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6987324 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack

6987326 its still hard to absorb but we were able to achieve something weve been dreaming of
6987327 when i was a player i was only able to win a silver medal so i hope i helped the players win this
6987328 this was the greatest home run ive ever hit in my life
6987329 this is probably the last time softball will be in the olympics although the sport will continue to be played
6987330 youd hear a lot of complaints that womens films are talky and relationship focused and dont have any action
6987331 i knew women were involved with smuggling and to me it was a satisfying way to look at an active story
6987332 something happens but the motivations are deeper and perhaps clearer than your usual crime story
6987333 the question i kept asking myself as i was writing was can two women from two different cultures really stick together when all hell breaks loose when their own personal futures are in jeopardy
6987334 when i wrote the movie i didnt know if they would i tried to tell the truth as i saw it and let it play out
6987335 ive been getting to know mohawk culture for several years and have made friends i met some women smugglers but i also met people who are against it and who arent into gambling either
6987336 i was very straight about what i was doing because i hate when filmmakers go and steal peoples stories and arent upfront about their motives
6987337 someone asked me at the q amp a if this kind of place is real
6987338 i mean if you go 70 or 80 miles outside any city youll see trailers around its not unusual here in the u s many people look at poverty as something to be embarrassed about like if you ended up in a trailer you must not be working hard enough its a judgment i feel is unfair
6987339 but how do you know whos living what kind of life where there are good hardworking people all over the place doing heroic things
6987340 we were going to make it in winnipeg which is not a bad match for upstate new york and scouted our locations but in the end we didnt have the budget to support it
6987341 i have a high flying agent and scripts are coming in every other day for me to direct
6987342 because it took so long for me to make my first feature i have two other scripts of my own written
6987343 id auditioned about seven times and atom finally called to say youre doing well
6987344 recalls bostick who started acting at 10 and has recently appeared in jeremy podeswas
6987345 i thought i was sunk that hed go with an american when my agent called to say id actually got the part i was shocked adoration has been the hardest and most rewarding project ive done so far i learned so much
6987346 i dont think ive been on a casting search for an unknown this wide perhaps since felicias journey when we found elaine cassidy who hails from county wicklow ireland we looked across the country we looked at hundreds of kids coming from everywhere but devon in the end felt absolutely right
6987347 hes very bright but theres also a quality to him that is unpredictable yet compelling hes not too smart for his own good and yet he reads with intelligence that was crucial for this role i felt if the character in any way seemed to understand the implications of what he was doing the tone of the film would have been wildly different
6987348 a lot of kids are very used to the performing aspects of their personality which can become quite cloying at a certain point but there was something very genuine about him
6987349 rock stars feel if they can do great dramatic roles in movies they can show everyone theyre serious artists and actors want that total crowd screaming adulation that rock stars get
6987350 i dont mind getting naked for comedic effect i used the same trainer brad pitt used for fight club
6987351 oh thanks for ruining my self image which is fragile already
6987352 at what point does holding on to your dreams become ridiculous
6987353 well there can only be so many rock stars at any given time my dream was to be a working actor period being a star wasnt even on my radar when i hosted
6987354 my thinking is live your dream but keep it within the bounds of realism
6987355 if you want to play an important role in the catholic church dont assume youre going to be pope dream of being president but commit to being a public servant and see where it takes you if you want to be an artist aspire to be a working artist and master your craft because hundreds of people show up in l a every day wanting to be a star and a lot of them have never even taken an acting class
6987356 lived his rock star fantasy as the lead singer in suburban chicagos worst rock band circa 1984
6987357 we were called collected moss because a rolling stone doesnt do what we did
6987358 we were a terrible cover band we did this mishmash of our favourite songs fire on the mountain so our deadhead could solo magic carpet ride for our rock guy i liked punk and new wave so i got them to play elvis costello and the clashs should i stay or should i go i still sing and play guitar but im pretty bad
6987359 stuart taught me a lot about not just the basics of drumming but the world of the heavy metal drummer
6987360 he said theyre the vegas magicians of drummers larger than life cheesy playing to the crowd im a thinker a reserved cerebral type but drummers are doers you put on a wig and leather pants and sit behind that kit and pound away and you just get bigger in every way
6987361 this little workplace comedy about a bunch of people in their 30s and 40s a comedy about paper clips and haircuts and the realities of life it proves that if comedy is specific it doesnt matter where its set people will embrace it im fortunate because there were any number of bad tv shows that i didnt get cast in i remember being crushed to not get a supporting part on according to jim and another one on becker
6987362 they gave me one of those god mikes that echoed through the entire mall i felt like i was justin timberlake i just riffed and the crowd went crazy if i had said everyone run into macys and set yourselves on fire they probably would have
6987363 you get famous and people start to look after your every need
6987364 you have to keep it in check in little ways you have to remind yourself of where you came from and whats important my wife is very good at that believe me
6987365 also you have to fight being pigeon holed a lot of people in hollywood just think of me as the annoying nerdy creepy guy but i want to play great parts and i know what im capable of as an actor
6987366 for some reason people naturally want to barack obama is a one term senator from illinois what would he know about running a country and look at that here i am comparing myself to barack obama
6987367 this tournament was meant for us were all very excited but we all expected to be in the gold medal game our whole mot to the last four years was to get back to the podium this has been our focus and were not done yet we have one more step to go
6987368 these guys have won tons of medals in the olympics at world championships and we havent for us to be able to believe in ourselves that we can overcome these guys and beat these experienced great players it means a lot i dont want to say it was lacking before but we definitely have it now
6987369 friday morning we decided it was going to be our day that there was nothing they could do to stop us
6987370 we were going to be confident in our shots and just let it go use all our energy everything we had and just put it into the game we were not going to worry about the score and just keep going and just play and its a lot of fun when you do that
6987371 for u s water polo this is a huge deal
6987372 it was as close to a dysfunctional family as you can find
6987373 they felt like they were outcasts in a way they felt almost like usa water polo turned its back on them
6987374 i didnt feel a whoosh but my eyes were open and then the next thing i knew my foot was stuck in the net and nobody was cheering for a goal
6987375 i just felt that she was there her run was a little bit late or my kick was a little bit too early however you want to take it it just wasnt in the stars for us tonight
6987376 it was their home opener everybodys pumped to have their first game right when we came out we could tell they were screaming they were excited they definitely came out here ready to play it was up to us to match them
6987377 we didnt feel that they were better than us but they were trying harder than us
6987378 that was laying it all out on the line thats what our teams all about
6987379 place the card back in the deck anywhere you want
6987380 ovviamente la questione piu importante e se questa persona e pronta a essere presidente
6987381 ma quella in cui non deve entrare e la casa bianca
6987382 barack obama deve una parte della casa in cui vive al criminale condannato tony rezko
6987383 obama ha dei progetti politici migliori ma li ha comunicati in modo che lelettorato capisca
6987384 the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city state and nation like the octopus of real life it operates under cover of a self created screen at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers the little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the united states government for their own selfish purposes they practically control both political parties
6987385 remember when you had thrush judy you had a hell of a time with it
6987386 when we were trying to conceive i would douse my balls in icy cold water before intercourse
6987387 i was accused of shoplifting but unlike you i knew i was innocent
6987388 you are unbelievably wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice really
6987389 will you end up with a bloke or a woman
6987390 youre just humming with sexual energy is it the fabric is it wearing tights
6987391 youre quite sharp its just that in the pure sense of the word youre ignorant
6987392 you looked as if your head was going to come off
6987393 your short term memory really is shot it must drive you nuts
6987394 dont take this the wrong way love but when you were younger did you have a brother or sister who used to steal food off you you know like dogs do and thats why they wolf their food down
6987395 youve previously made waves by breaking long distance swimming records in the arctic and antarctic tell me when you swim in the antarctic do your nuts go really really tiny
6987396 now obviously you loved your father but do you think you were actually in love with him
6987397 so when did you first realise that you were quite clearly mad
6987398 werent you once a story telling raccoon in a theme park what sort of stories did you have to tell as a raccoon did you have a special raccoon voice
6987399 theres no place id rather be than here with you guys right now
6987400 that was the day i fell in love with him and im still in love with him

6987402 the peak at the center is heaven and the valleys represent hell
6987403 may i suggest you start w the clothes youre wearing
6987404 i was maybe a little eccentric in high school i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year and i remember the first time i heard a couple of guys commenting that i had a nice body it was such a huge shock it felt really good
6987405 as a high school junior i wanted to hang out with the cooler kids who were going to parties my brother is three years older and both of us went through our partying drinking phases in high school i would sneak out and stay out late i got caught with a fake id when i was 20 i had to go to court i was terrified of what my parents were going to do but they thought it was hysterically funny it was like wait what happened to the parents i used to know who wouldve been furious
6987406 look im really sorry and normally i wouldnt do this but you have to call me ah nuh if youre going to play my boyfriend
6987407 oh kevin connolly for sure we got along great and hes a lovely guy he treated me with a lot of respect he was a true professional i enjoy parties but i have to say i dont really go to clubs at all ill go to a dive bar and i love hanging out at home drinking wine watching a movie im pretty low key i love to host people at my house but i tend to start early and crash early ill just sneak away to the bedroom shut the door and let my friends enjoy themselves for the rest of the night
6987408 when i was in college i decided to quit acting i had a job prospect at an ad agency in london and i was going to go live there my parents were disappointed that i was throwing in the towel but i just didnt want a life of struggle if i was able to get a day of work doing voice over stuff for a commercial or if i was hired to do a training video or something i just saw it as great college money
6987409 i started to work out intensively a month before shooting i cut out carbs and i used a padded bra that i still pull out every now and then
6987410 youre scantily clad during most of the film did you feel self conscious
6987411 oh so you snuck by me huh well good for you
6987412 oh that aint the half of it im gonna let you kick me out again and ill still get back in
6987413 the lack of concern is simply appalling the swiftness of it is what im applauding in conclusion its seems that logically the thought of it all just seemed enticing at first
6987414 dont you dare f g skimp on the hot fudge
6987415 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
6987416 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
6987417 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
6987418 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
6987419 big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6987420 im stoked most everyone dresses up on their sweet 16 not me im going to be ready to get in the water and ready get on the crazy rides thats all i want to do the entire time is ride the rides

6987431 if there isnt common ground then he has a decision to make about whether or not to visit the governor general
6987432 if parliament comes back there will be a confidence motion at the first available opportunity according to the bloc
6987433 well have one last good faith attempt in terms of a private meeting between the prime minister and opposition leaders
6987434 is trying to save face trying to find an excuse to once again break his word this time on the fixed election date law
6987435 the official excuse that parliament is not functioning is phony
6987436 what is true is that the prime minister does not want people to realize he has ethical problems in his government and to what extent he has badly prepared us as a country for the economic slowdown we face
6987437 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6987438 the riding has a number of strong candidates and for that reason alone its an interesting race
6987439 but you also have an interesting dynamic playing out now at the federal level
6987440 people dont believe that if the government takes money from you that its going to be revenue neutral
6987441 the harper approach appeals to those who like a few more dollars in their pocket and dont realize those dollars would go with sound social programs
6987442 maar begin er niet aan als u niet eerst hebt berekend wat het u gaat kosten

6987445 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6987446 ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today
6987447 a member of the house of represenatives usually doesnt have the status to add a lot to the ticket you are not going to win texas for the democrats so geographically it doesnt help him and with the last name edwards half the guys are going to think hes the guy who had the affair who ran for president
6987448 none of the names in circulation would give you huge advantage on the ticket other than the one who seems to be out of circulation hillary clinton
6987449 who knows i could have a job announced in the near future you cant tell
6987450 oil prices continued to slide shedding over 20 percent in value after hitting record highs of over 140 a barrel in july on mounting concern that slower economic growth in the united states would translate into lower global energy demand said the does weekly oil monitoring report
6987451 this slide continued in six consecutive weeks with the continuing market worries on weakening demand particularly in us europe and china the worlds second oil importer which reported a 7 percent decline in oil imports for july marking the steepest drop since december
6987452 it is a tricky enough game anyway but we are aware there might be a backlash from the chelsea defeat by portsmouth
6987453 we have played them a couple of times already in pre season which maybe helps a bit because it is important to get that win
6987454 the manager has a few more things to deal with with us coming back from international week but we do not want to give other teams a head start
6987455 hopefully i will be here as long as the manager wants me
6987456 it is a squad game now and i am happy here doing what i am doing
6987457 when i get in it is a case of making sure i do enough to give the manager a difficult decision to leave me out the next time that is the challenge i face every time i play
6987458 i would like to think i can play a bigger part this year
6987459 he has never given any trouble since he started grade eight in the school we were just worried about him not having a vision we were not aware of the underlying problem
6987460 where we could we stood up for him and spoke to the bullies involved but also accepted it as part of life
6987461 morne was a small baby at birth and through life we knew him as someone quiet who knew his place
6987462 we suspect a combination of stress bad self esteem wrong influences and an absolute feeling of powerlessness led our child to this terrible deed
6987463 european football is a savage blow this year but you have to look to next year as well and if we can win the league then european football is a must for us
6987464 its a lure to players when you are bringing them here but the great thing about steve davis is that he knew the club knew the players and the league
6987465 mendes told the gaffer he knew about rangers and maurice edu spoke to damarcus beasley about us
6987466 weve been lucky that the players have still wanted to come to the club even though there is no europe this season
6987467 this is still a very important season for us last season was magic in europe but this year we have to go and win the league
6987468 there are two weeks to go before the window closes and if the opportunity arises to strengthen again well do that
6987469 but if we dont i wont be broken hearted the key issue for us was midfield and we have strengthened that area
6987470 i would hope that we are good enough to challenge
6987471 im not saying carlos is a distant memory but madjid has come in and done very well
6987472 we have got cover in that area because we have boys who can be shifted along the back only time will tell if we are stronger without carlos
6987473 weve lost a fantastic centre half but we made a lot of money from him and allowed us to buy in an area that needed strengthening
6987474 i dont think weve weakened our defence because madjid has done fine
6987475 i think that there is a lot of excitement about the use of androgens male hormones to treat low sexual desire in women that is based on evidence that looks better than it really is
6987476 this area of research is being driven by the incredible profits that pharma companies are expecting given that one in three women in the us will rate herself as having low sexual desire
6987477 i think that there is a substantial body of evidence that hangs together very well that says that raising your level of androgen may well raise your risk of breast cancer
6987478 there are two kinds of failures those who thought and never did and those who did and never thought
6987479 the taser must be in the hands of those qualified and trained but also those who have the knowledge experience and judgment to know in which circumstances this weapon may be most effective
6987480 if you have four gangbangers driving around in a vehicle with an unregistered gun or even a registered gun not registered to them they cant all say i dont know how it got here
6987481 you know what that person has an obligation to know whats in his vehicle and otherwise that vehicles going to be transported downtown and its going to be sold

6987486 obviously you have to give a lot of credit to miss constant and their family they were persistent courageous and diligent
6987487 it was frustrating for us but hats off to her for staying with it because at the end everybody learned from this
6987488 the system is broken people dont have confidence in the process and they feel they arent being treated fairly
6987489 65 of respondents agreed that legal aid should be given the same funding priority as other vital social services such as health care education welfare and child protection
6987490 i like my game i like the way im playing

6987492 a partir de este sabadoa se espera un incremento significativo de las lluvias
6987493 in this case the public might fairly question why it has taken until 2008 to even approach the start of a trial on alleged misconduct by police officers that occurred for the most part in 1997 and 1998
6987494 the creation of this body is in line with governments goal of providing safe and secure communities for albertans
6987495 it will help maintain transparency accountability and public trust in how investigations against police are handled
6987496 help maintain transparency accountability and public trust in how investigations against police are handled
6987497 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6987498 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

6987515 it helped having ruby there not just for warmth but for moral support as well

6987517 you came in were locked up and then at the end you were thrown back out without any help back to where you came from only now more bitter and hardened
6987518 coinciding with the olympic games theres a certain kind of extremely brutal repression that continues to reign
6987519 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
6987520 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6987521 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at sen obamas campaign
6987522 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6987523 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6987524 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6987525 our school does its best to train them to be professional to join in the olympics
6987526 the sports schools in some ways are a metaphor for chinese culture as a whole
6987527 american athletes theres a story about some kid in the middle of idaho and they started running
6987528 in china everybody seems to have the same story they were identified when they were 4 because they had long arms or double jointed elbows and then theyre incorporated into this little system that is designed to build champions
6987529 our system is designed for the people with passion and talent but ours is a much more organic process theirs is much more centrally organized china is a country run by engineers
6987530 thats been one of the dangers of this system they are really left to their own devices without skills without an education
6987531 they are denied their childhood in pursuit of this magical goal the nation will achieve its glory by tapping them like being tapped for the armed forces
6987532 i dont think its a coincidence that in china the chinese term for a retired athlete is the same as for a retired serviceman veteran
6987533 he is the guest of the iranian government who will control him until such time as they have comfortably wrested control of the mahdi army away from him

6987564 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past
6987565 this was the first series they could not perform i feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade
6987566 the importance of my religion has increased as i have got older
6987567 i couldnt put a time frame on it but i have found that following the islamic way of life has a lot of beauty to it
6987568 although i was born into a muslim family i wasnt always practising the more i have understood the differences in the various faiths i have adopted as much of islam as possible
6987569 im certainly no saint but the discipline of the islamic way of life has helped my cricket without a doubt i dont drink i pray five times a day which gives stability to my daily routine and i am generally more disciplined about my game and my life
6987570 way back when i used to go to a place called chocolate bar

6987578 ocean kayak malibu two 2 ii sit on top sot nwt 08 new la
6987579 the course was much easier before than this year and i was surprised on the first lap
6987580 they added one more downhill which was dangerous i also had brake trouble on the third lap
6987581 it was really hard it was really steep and it was really hot
6987582 i think that seeing the response from how last season finished i think that they got a taste of what its like to play in the frozen four and get so close
6987583 now theyve got to go through the work of trying to get back there again
6987584 any time youre slated to play one of the top teams its going to be an exciting game but the fact that we finished last season against them im sure our guys will have a little more incentive in that game
6987585 theyre going to be one of the top teams in the country again itll be a big game just from a rivalry factor
6987586 at the end of the season we had four or five guys who had to have surgery and fairly substantial injuries
6987587 when youre playing with the intensity level that we did in the ncaa tournament you get banged up and thats the kind of price that youve got to pay to get back there
6987588 the things that made us successful in the ncaa tournament against michigan michigan state and new hampshire weve got to remember what kind of price we paid to get to that point
6987589 if we assume things will just fall in place thats not how it works were going to have to play with that same kind of passion we played with in the ncaa tournament just to get back there again
6987590 nick maggio right now unless something different happens will be our starting placekicker particularly anything with extra points or medium to close field goal range
6987591 throughout practice maggios percentage has been really good hes in the 85 percent range you can live with that in field goal range and hes 100 percent with extra points
6987592 i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period
6987593 those three games last year really put me over the top confidence wise
6987594 if i ever doubt myself i can go back to the film and see the throws already
6987595 i think hes going to do anything at that spot if he can hold off mitch mustain and aaron corp
6987596 your adrenaline is up a little bit when youre working with the first team
6987597 the way you prepare doesnt change but it gives you a little edge
6987598 were always going to give guys an opportunity to play
6987599 we need a third guy to step up because wed like to come out in a set with three receivers
6987600 you start thinking this is the guy and then all of a sudden he drops the ball for two days then he misses this block then he does that
6987601 so somebody out of that pack needs to come up and help jordan and quan
6987602 the package with john and colt which last year was something we just dabbled in weve had more time this year
6987603 we actually had three real good plays today out of that package of plays with those guys in there
6987604 the coaches have made it easy for us to learn because weve done a lot of repetitions in practice im trying to make sure i dont fall behind on learning the new stuff by watching more film and studying the playbook
6987605 seventeen years of sport at the highest level is a long time after another olympic season im convinced its the right time for me to turn my attention to other things
6987606 today was kind of the day of guys going to scout team redshirting that type of thing
6987607 there were a lot of meetings today a lot of talking
6987608 were going to continue to evaluate its going to be a day to day thing but as of today seawrights the number one kicker he struggled early in camp but once he got his bearings he was very consistent gives us a little bit more range
6987609 theres going to be probably a broader rotation than weve ever had at receiver
6987610 see how they practice with game planning and that type of thing and see what the game plan turns out to be on how to use them
6987611 were going to need to have some depth at nose to keep those guys fresh
6987612 with derrick hill kendrick payne mike costanzo those four guys are all going to get into the rotation
6987613 hes gone through camp banged up hes been hobbled through camp and hes really kind of sucked it up and done a nice job
6987614 hopefully in the next couple days when they get a chance to rest a little bit hell be 100 percent
6987615 we are excited to have osceola and renegade appear at the fsu vs colorado game
6987616 i know when i first took this job one of the things i looked forward to most was seeing the tradition and pageantry of that symbol in person it is unusual for osceola and renegade to appear anywhere but at home games so it will be a special event for our fans
6987617 ive been to jacksonville as a student for the games but now that we get to bring the whole renegade team it will be a fantastic event a lot of people dont even know who chief osceola and the renegade team are so this will be a great spectacle for bringing out the school spirit
6987618 the university of colorado was going to bring their mascot too but due to complications there was a setback it would have been great because we were going to train the buffalo and the horse together
6987619 to be on the olympic program is an issue where you need universality as much as possible
6987620 you need to have a sport with a following you need to have the best players and you need to be in strict compliance with wada world anti doping agency and these are the qualifications that have to be met when you have all that you have to win hearts you can win the mind but you still must win hearts
6987621 we have roger federer rafael nadal in tennis lebron james in basketball we have the best cyclists ronaldinho is here in football we want these guys at the games were not saying it should be an entire major league team but we want the top athletes here at the olympics
6987622 we will consider the possibility for baseball to come back as softball also is considered next year in october
6987623 the majority of the guys on the two deep have had some significant playing time or starting experience and i think that can only help
6987624 the continuity we built i think is a big thing too most of us had never played with each other before last year so thats good to build off of and well try to add to that this year
6987625 we need to come out and play together as a unit and block those guys across from us
6987626 he really is like a coach on the field seth is very knowledgeable
6987627 hes very passionate he loves the game he understands whats going on and hes really good at helping other guys
6987628 in anything you do any sport whatever you do anytime you have somebody behind you thats constantly on your heels pushing you it forces you to stay focused and continue to get better
6987629 there are things that we need to work on from a fundamental standpoint obviously sacks and how can we do a better job of that from an individual standpoint from a schematics standpoint and you know certain things in the run and the pass game that weve identified
6987630 when you lose your starting point guard and your leading scorer it leaves a lot of holes
6987631 we are going to need a lot of people doing a little bit more
6987632 we expect her to be ready for the first day of practice
6987633 melissa lechlitner will be the starting point guard i am confident in her she is a great leader from the point guard position
6987634 we went to the sweet 16 last year and we want to get back
6987635 we would also like to do well in the big east which is something we did not do last year
6987636 i feel like im still in my first years with my emotions and my passion for coaching
6987637 la raz n para la escalada fueron los incesantes ataques contra aldeas georgianas por parte de osetia en las ltimas dos semanas el lado georgiano pidi varias veces a las fuerzas de paz rusas que intervinieron pero ellos no hicieron nada y no fue posible detener a los osetios sin atacarlos es por eso que el ej rcito georgiano ingres en la zona del conflicto a fin de detener la agresi n y restablecer el orden constitucional en la regi n
6987638 en cuanto a estados unidos ellos quieren tener acceso a territorio georgiano por diferentes razones una es el tr nsito de petr leo y gas y segundo establecer una base militar para el ej rcito estadounidense en caso de un ataque contra ir n y para ubicar radares o sistemas antimisiles

6987655 i want all the caucus goers in this great state to close their eyes and imagine if their candidate is president of the united states not in a year but this very instant are they confident that they have the sure footedness the steady enough hand to know exactly what they would do in pakistan to know exactly what they would do not generically exactly what they would do in iraq are they ready because ladies and gentlemen they are going to have to act
6987656 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6987657 w hen i started i wondered whether id have the passion and the energy to do this what has surprised me i feel more passionate about the possibilities for this country than i did when i was 29 years old and elected to the senate
6987658 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6987659 t heres millions of americans who have gone through difficult things so i dont know how it affects the voters but i know how it affected me
6987660 it makes me realize that theres nothing that is critical other than life and death and that there is a solution to almost every problem
6987661 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
6987662 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
6987663 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
6987664 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
6987665 if we can win at home today we might even go top once you get that going you get a bit of a buzz around the place and build some momentum
6987666 the games do come thick and fast but the players like them after playing so many friendlies in pre season
6987667 i think what was good about it was not just the game but the number of people who came to watch it was a great crowd two sets of supporters who are passionate about their teams so credit to them it was a good advert for the league
6987668 we set ourselves a target of taking 10 points from the five games this month so at the moment we are on course for that and if we go beyond that it would be lovely
6987669 im delighted because its good football theres no doubt about it and it makes you think about what you have got to do i want to test myself and if it works we will be there or thereabouts at the end of the season
6987670 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6987671 i have no intention of retiring as long as i can keep going
6987672 ive been asked if i will hold for my 60th anniversary and i just have to say i will keep working as long as i can
6987673 i will just have to see how the world turns
6987674 this is the only steady job ive had in my life
6987675 i dont know what i would have done if it werent for mooney
6987676 this is just a big family that takes pride in what we build
6987677 its a pleasure to work with people who take that much pride and have such a good attitude
6987678 speed and performance is the name of the game in the aircraft industry
6987679 i enjoy showing our products to different people in the world
6987680 there are so many people who dont realize what goes into building a quality piece of aircraft its a complex piece of machinery
6987681 if you enjoy the job and the people you work with time goes by
6987682 i get there early enough so that mooney operators in australia asia south africa and europe have someone they can reach when they call with a technical problem
6987683 helping people out and getting a pat on the back for it is an ego thing at my age

6987690 to ourselves we are great yet most of us live life without making a stand contented to blend into the background of self rendering nothingness and when looking back feel contented at our mediocre accomplishments nobody remembers the person who conformed out of inadequacy nobody notices a patch of grass they see the tree inspirational quotes by wayne burrow philosopher
6987691 its tough its probably the lowest point for me that ive had to deal with i think ive kind of bottomed out ive got to focus with my pitching coach chuck hernandez on getting my stuff back where it needs to be what lefties are doing against me 315 batting average is reveal ing
6987692 ive always felt that when ive had my legitimate slider which is my out pitch i could get out of anything this year for whatever reason its just been inconsistent off and on when it flattens out its very hittable if i dont have anything to throw in conjunction with the fastball im in trouble that slider has always been the no 1 weapon for me to throw with my fastball its been there but its flattened out too many times
6987693 skip leyland has to make the best decision for this club and right now he cant feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i dont feel good about going out there after what happened in texas i know i have better stuff than that
6987694 ill probably have to do some changes in the off season ive got right around 1 000 big league innings and at some point youve got to adjust im not getting any younger hell turn 31 on sept 3 and i have to start thinking about how the body changes and tailor something that is going to work for me i have to do everything i possibly can to maintain what im capable of going out there and doing
6987695 were going to look into that i might have less muscular flexibility than anyone on the team
6987696 i want to give back thats what kills me more than anything for me not to consistently produce that really bothers me
6987697 would it be nice if dontrelle would be able to pitch for us in september yes is that going to happen i cant answer that
6987698 that was discussed last night with dave dombrowski the general manager and were not sure what might be best for dontrelle at this point we dont know
6987699 weve just got to see some guys to help us get through a game
6987700 he should start throwing quickly after the cast comes off
6987701 i think it was really important for me to get a chance to get out there and kind of run the offense a little bit and see how things evolved right in front of my eyes
6987702 i viewed those as a test to see where im at
6987703 i dont view it as that at all i think its one of those things that was out of my control and its one of those things that happens throughout the course of a practice or a game put a cast on it and try and let it heal its going to heal as fast as my body will allow it to
6987704 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6987705 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6987706 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6987707 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6987708 injuries are such a significant part in these preseason games we cant afford to get anybody hurt
6987709 were going to take a gamble and play a little bit more they played only 10 12 snaps theyll probably play 20
6987710 but normally the rule of thumb is play a whole half and start into the third quarter were not going to do that
6987711 you see what happened to chad johnson happened right in the first series of the game
6987712 i mean you just dont know so if we get through 20 25 plays and everybody is going ok regardless of whats going on theyre coming out
6987713 sometimes a guy can come in at the end of the second quarter and their starters might be out so the competition level might be a little bit different
6987714 so what you do is just maybe rotate guys a little bit earlier in the game
6987715 i could say well go try to cut him to the ground every down but were not going to do that
6987716 yeah hes about as big a defensive nose tackle as youll see in this league and well see if we can try to make him run sideline to sideline
6987717 you want it to end with a little less excitement than that
6987718 if the ball hadnt hit where it hit it kicks off to the side
6987719 he borrowed my rental car on the off day to go to the movies
6987720 you take that into the offseason and reset i think the whole team feels that way
6987721 were still out there playing with pride just because we seem to be out of playoff contention doesnt mean we cant go out there and achieve
6987722 its kinda crazy because im going to be one of the first guamanians to tour around with someone big like that but its cool hopefully hes a real chill person

6987791 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6987792 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6987793 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6987794 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6987795 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6987852 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
6987853 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
6987854 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
6987855 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
6987856 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
6987857 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
6987858 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
6987859 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
6987860 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future

6987869 i dont underestimate the ability of the labour party to win even under gordon brown
6987870 i dont think hes a particularly attractive prime minister but i dont assume that theyve lost it
6987871 were spending a lot of time now thinking about that early period and the things you need to get going for example education reform which will be a very early priority of the conservative government
6987872 im of the view and this was certainly the case at last years party conference that youve got to give the public time to see what youre offering if the price of that is that some of them are adopted by the labour party then so be it
6987873 i think there is a massive opportunity for the conservative party to say look you have had your go at trying to use left wing methods of simply redistributing cash to achieve a fairer society now let the conservatives show that its about more than redistributing cash its about giving people real opportunity and tackling the causes of poverty im very clear that a conservative government would seek to reduce the national income taken by the state
6987874 tony blair was a good politician but not a good prime minister and thats what we dont want to be we dont want to be just people who are good at winning elections we want to be good at governing i think we benefit from having seen the mistakes that we think tony blair made in 1997
6987875 they labour were so focused on crossing the finishing line that they didnt know what they were going to do afterwards in british politics you can collapse exhausted across the finishing line at four in the morning on the election night suddenly youre in office the next day

6987898 were going to get people who before went off to princeton and stanford and mit some of those young people are going to come here
6987899 its a little bit of young people who are able to see what they might be doing in the future and their part of protecting america
6987900 but i think with the amount of advertising that the typical high school kid sees the money would be better spent targeting those kids who need only make a very small transition to go into a very competitive situation
6987901 how do we reach out and market the naval academy to a young diverse achieving group who want to as the theme says fulfill their destiny
6987902 is to reach out to those who havent considered the naval academy
6987903 and more what i consider under represented ethnic and racial minorities
6987904 i think its going to take a generation to get an officer corps that will represent america
6987905 my goal is to get moving down that path at the naval academy
6987906 its an important part of getting over the fear of the unknown and the uncertainty of military service
6987907 she will honor what is required of her but im not sure how happy she is in cooperating now that the states attorneys office had her arrested and had homicide officers breaking down her door

6987918 itll be good to see i know we can run the football thats no secret to come out and run the ball again in this game really isnt important because im not worried about that
6987919 i want to see how much we can do with our first unit throwing the ball so it will be a good test for us
6987920 thats what were going to do until we click 100 percent and perfect it like we should
6987921 the run is definitely a major base part of our offense

6987927 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
6987928 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom

6987941 i know everyone up there its one of those social things
6987942 plus he lets us play dominoes on his bench if you cant surf and you can only swim so far
6987943 i dont think any lawyer would do what you said you wanted your lawyer to do on your first trial date
6987944 you would be presumed to know the rules of procedure and the rules of evidence

6987986 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
6987987 8 weeks to profits formula jason pearson the developer of
6987988 no longer feels that andrew moodie is a reliable interlocutor
6987989 and im guessing that on a certain level the whole company must feel like the share the stage initiative is threatening the integrity of the family nothing could be further from the truth if the shaw festival wants to differentiate itself from other theatres by creating a sense of family then by all means do so but in that family you can have all the shades of the planet
6987990 family is an idea and a term i never use as i think it is inaccurate reductive and implies an emotional closed shop which we are not what i had hoped to make clear is that shaw festivals acting company is a deeply committed ensemble of actors who are not hired as this lead or that lead but as members of a company
6987991 it was a really civil and very heartfelt exchange of ideas and thoughts
6987992 added to things that ive already put in motion now i have to be able to get down to doing it in a way that makes sense for all of us
6987993 she could have called me a while ago and said yknow this facebook thing isnt working out
6987994 none of this would have happened without facebook if maxwell wants to speak with me in privacy great but there are people who want to know there are people in the diverse community who want to feel that all the years theyve been waiting are coming to an end
6987995 people to feel im raising a ruckus to get my work done at shaw
6987996 it took me three years of auditions but i finally became a dancer at wonderland
6987997 after my second year at chiropractic college i took a sabbatical to study dance intensively in new york and los angeles i made a lot of sacrifices to take classes in new york i lived on one meal a day and in los angeles i slept in my car
6987998 my parents just didnt get it that i would give up school for dance but when i brought them to new york to see the show they were impressed
6987999 i had no aspirations for leading roles because while i did study voice i wasnt a great singer what i became was a great featured dancer because i danced my butt off i knew fosse would be my last show as a performer because i was ready to move on something creative was missing and i wanted to be a choreographer
6988000 that jersey boys would go on to greatness we pulled the show together in three weeks but it was magical the way it all gelled im really proud of the show because it is good theatre and so wonderfully creative
6988001 i want my story to get out there because im living my dream somewhere in canada there is an immigrant kid who thinks he has a handicap because his family is starting from scratch i want them to know that everything is possible

6988003 between 2004 and 2007 the company also picked up at least 31m from the department for work and pensions 20m from the department for communities and local government 17m from the ministry of defence 16m from the department for the environment food and rural affairs 9m from the department for education and its successors and 3 5m from the cabinet office
6988004 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6988005 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6988006 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6988007 clarify the claims made in the media regarding the age of chinese female gymnasts he kexin jiang yuyuan li shanshan deng linlin and yang yilin
6988008 the fig provided documentary evidence including copies of the athletes passports when questions were raised in online media earlier this year
6988009 in the interests of laying the matter to rest the fig has now asked the chinese gymnastic association to submit further documents testifying to the birthdates of the gymnasts
6988010 on receipt of these documents the fig will forward its conclusions to the ioc its in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all

6988015 we start every series well we always win the first game and then we mess the next four up
6988016 the key to the win tonight friday is to make sure we focus on tuesday and turn up with the same energy and same buzz
6988017 im a captain who wants my players to be confident and play without fear and do a proper decent job thats what i do all my life i have been doing that and i think it is rubbing off on some of the lads
6988018 things are working at the moment and it is down to the way the guys have reacted over the last two weeks
6988019 it was a real turn up for the books that michael did what he did but that was right for michael
6988020 but it is hats off to the lads they have shown such energy and passion the dressing room is such a happy place and that is because we are winning

6988064 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6988065 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6988066 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6988067 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6988068 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6988152 we will also strengthen animal id and the national school lunch program including language to provide market based incentives to strengthen both the national animal identification system nais and the national school lunch program this proposal would increase participation in the animal id program also in a case such as the historic hallmark westland beef recall earlier this year we would know about the history of the animals involved which could help address public health concerns beginning with the 2010 school year that starts in july 2009 the bill includes language that requires usda to purchase for the school lunch program meat products that are derived from livestock premises registered with national animal identification system because ams is a major purchaser of meat products through the school lunch program this proposal would generate significant market based incentives to strengthen the departments voluntary animal id system and support livestock producers and other premises that signup for usdas system importantly the bills purchasing requirements will not take effect until july 2009 the start of the next school year and over a year from now this will provide time for schools food vendors and the livestock industry to prepare the upcoming higher standards the public has already made a massive investment in usdas nais system 128 million since fiscal year 2004 why not use the system that the public has paid for to support producers who voluntarily enroll in nais and to strengthen the animal traceability capability to provide better assurances for the national school lunch program the bill provides a total nais funding level of 14 5 million or about 4 8 million above 2008 congress has provided 128 million to date in good faith to implement nais unfortunately aphiss delivery has been less than stellar out of 1 4 million livestock premises aphis has only registered to date about 469 000 premises thats less than 33 percent of the agencys goal after four years and one state wisconsin comprises about one eighth of the total nationwide registrations at aphiss current rate of enrolling about 1 500 premises per week it will take aphis another 13 years to achieve its goal of 100 percent registration first it provides a sizable and reasonable increase in funding about 2008 of 4 8 million second the bill follows the advice of one of our former presidents trust but verify the bills report details specific implementation milestones to shine the spotlight on aphiss delivery of nais the committee worked in consultation with the agency and we largely derived these performance measures from the agencys own nais business plan we are going to move well beyond tracking the number of premises registered and follow more closely how aphis is using the money the nais milestones include 1 48 hour traceability standards for specific species and 2 program administration deliverables with regards to country of origin labeling cool the bill fully supports usdas efforts to implement the food labeling law by increasing the agricultural marketing services ams budget by 9 6 million to begin administering and auditing cool importantly the bill pays for the program by providing an increase in appropriated funding instead of raising fees on food retailers as the president proposed as far as oversight the bill includes stringent milestones to ensure that usda remains on track for the remainder of this year so that we will have no excuses cool will be fully implemented by september 30 2008 finally i just want to mention that we will work closely with the agriculture community the fda and usda on the implementation of the farm bill in closing there is more here and i look forward to working with all of you today as we move toward full committee to craft responsible legislation that honors working and middle class americans today and reflects our priorities as a nation thank you

6988156 i grew up in midwest farm country and even then i was intrigued by new ways of farming
6988157 as i grew up i learned that there were new ways to grow fruits vegetables and flowers when i discovered hydroponics it gave me a vision of the future to work towards and now i am asking senators obama and mccain to look to the hydroponics industry as they make their campaigns farm policies
6988158 while mccain and obama have many differences with each other about their farm policies neither of them are considering the numerous benefits of hydroponics
6988159 hydroponics farming receives not one single penny of the millions available in federal subsidies or any other support even though more and more people are staking their future on hydroponics farming
6988160 the european countries are well ahead of the us on this old world technology
6988161 whoever gets elected obama or mccain they ought to consider giving a helping hand to an industry that can create millions of jobs use far less ag chemicals and produce very high yields in very small spaces
6988162 we created advanced nutrients and are now seeing hydroponics catching hold in the suburbs and for commercial farming
6988163 as obama and mccain debate the 300 billion farm bill they ought to consider that hydroponics is the farming wave of the future
6988164 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6988165 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6988170 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6988171 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6988172 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6988173 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6988174 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6988175 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6988176 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6988177 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6988178 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6988179 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6988180 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6988181 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6988182 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6988185 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica

6988187 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6988188 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6988189 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6988190 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6988191 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6988192 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6988193 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6988194 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6988195 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6988196 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6988197 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6988198 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6988199 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6988200 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6988201 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6988202 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6988203 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6988204 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6988205 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6988206 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6988207 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6988208 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6988209 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6988210 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6988211 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6988215 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6988216 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6988217 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6988218 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6988219 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6988220 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6988221 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6988222 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6988223 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6988229 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6988230 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6988231 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6988232 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6988233 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6988234 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6988235 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6988236 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6988238 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6988239 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6988240 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6988241 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6988242 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6988243 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6988244 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6988245 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6988246 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6988247 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6988248 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6988249 it really poses almost no threat at all to the tree or makes it structurally unsound
6988250 its getting cleaner but not clean enough that theyd really want to swim yet or eat the fish more because of the industrial pollutants than from all the human waste going in
6988251 given that the harbour has got a relatively clean bill of health at the moment and assuming that people are cooking the fish properly i wouldnt be concerned about it personally
6988252 if somebody was relying entirely on this as their major source of protein in other words if it was a really significant part of their diet as opposed to an occasional part of their diet then i would say maybe somebody should do some health checks just to make sure not on the individual but rather on the quality of the fish but i certainly think theres no reason to get terribly concerned about this
6988253 it is indeed reasonable to say that theres a clean bill of health for the harbour fairly quickly after the sewage has been properly treated
6988254 as someone who is fairly risk conscious and at the same time really interested in environmental protection and improved environment i wouldnt worry in the least bit about swimming in the harbour but i might think twice about eating fish just now because thats like a step further
6988255 i think the fish that i probably feel most comfortable eating from the harbour would be mackerel because theyre a migratory fish
6988256 if they were to come into the harbour they wouldnt have been here for long and they dont stay for long or theyre moving around more things like harbour pollock or cod i might be less inclined to eat the longer the fish lives in these waters perhaps the greater the chance or probability of contamination
6988257 we know still that even with advanced primary treatment when you get the storm water overflow they close the harbour for swimming because of the elevated levels of fecal coliform
6988258 im very concerned about children not being outside enough and interacting with nature
6988259 i really wanted to learn how to bring students outside and how to bring nature into the classroom
6988260 a dion government would sit down with the provincial government and engage both the government of nova scotia and nova scotia power in a constructive discussion on how to help nova scotia make the green shift and we would invest in it
6988261 this is really what i would call quite predictable from mr brison he states a position then it changes he pouts and then he goes personal and attacks people as hes doing now with the premier
6988262 a full branch plant operation of stephen harpers ottawa office
6988263 either hes trying to get out of third place in the polls in nova scotia or hes already assuming hes going to lose the next election and hes trying to get a patronage appointment perhaps as ambassador like pat binns got after he lost the premiership of p e i
6988264 he is being completely dishonest and dishonourable he obviously has an agenda more focused on his own self preservation than the interest of nova scotia he is looking for a golden parachute
6988265 until they add that part of it theyre engaged in a partisan rant with no substance
6988266 proven himself very capable of getting down into the gutter
6988267 unlike most other people im being straight with you if asked i will do it ive made it clear i do not want to be asked
6988268 if the presidential nominee thought i could help him win am i going to say to the first african american candidate about to make history in the world that

6988270 playing the drum and singing the songs is a good way to learn the words and the culture
6988271 they are getting a cultural presentation every time they sit at the drum and play and sing
6988272 i dont want them to forget who they are and where they came from
6988273 i dont want them to forget the language which is thousands and thousands of years old i want them to pass it on to their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren so it will never be forgotten
6988274 it is very special to me that i get to do this
6988275 i like to be here to learn the mikmaq words and to meet new people
6988276 its very hard to get it to be the primary issue particularly for politicians who are making budget decisions because they are not getting the same pressure about mental health as they get about cancer and coronary disease and diabetes
6988277 we working from the opportunity we have within government organizations such as the national association and the nova scotia association and other groups and all of us collectively need to be doing something much more significant to make this a burning bridge issue for decision makers
6988278 i think one of the challenges around mental illness is that its unique properties include affecting our thinking our moods and our behaviour the very dimensions that define us as individuals
6988279 that makes it a lot tougher to separate the illness from the person
6988280 the reality of mental illness its mundane reality is virtually never depicted
6988281 the same applies to the newspapers because somebody recovering from mental illness or somebody simply making a great adaptation to mental illness is about as newsworthy as a plane landing safely at the airport
6988282 think of how far it has come in the ensuing 25 years
6988283 its really an extraordinary social transformation mental illness has not come anywhere near as far as hiv
6988284 ive had parents come in who have no idea what montessori entails but theyve just heard that montessori is a good school and they register their child
6988285 even if theyre not interested in signing up their child with my school if they just want to come by to get information see a classroom see the materials im always willing to give out as much information as possible on this philosophy
6988286 but i dont think i should have to pay to have my car fixed for something that was their fault
6988287 chebucto road in general is very frustrating because there are so many people doing work there

6988295 our results were encouraging surprisingly long lasting and the costs were relatively modest
6988296 this shows that treating depression can work well when its part and parcel of a patients cancer care however theres more work that needs to be done to show that this approach can work in practice before we can recommend implementation of this model on a large scale we are doing that work now

6988309 financials will remain in play and the anxiety over fannie mae and freddie mac will remain in the market place
6988310 its still possible that the government will nationalize fannie and freddie
6988311 nationalization will have a negative impact on the stock market as it will put tax payers on hook

6988313 su questo mi pare ci sia una posizione comune del sindacato il sindacato non pu che rappresentare un nucleo di interessi comuni noi ci sentiamo molto pi solidi e forti il sindacato tanto pi riesce a ragionare in termini unitari tanto pi forte negli interessi che rappresenta

6988315 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6988316 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6988317 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6988318 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6988319 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6988320 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6988321 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6988322 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6988323 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6988324 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6988325 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6988326 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6988327 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6988328 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6988329 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6988330 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6988331 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6988332 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6988333 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6988334 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6988335 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6988336 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6988337 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6988338 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6988339 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6988340 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6988341 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6988342 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6988343 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6988344 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6988345 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6988346 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6988348 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6988349 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6988350 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6988351 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6988352 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6988353 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6988354 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6988355 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6988356 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6988357 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6988358 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6988359 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6988360 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6988361 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6988362 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6988363 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6988364 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6988365 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6988369 i want to assure you that one of the great accomplishments of president bush is we now have judges on the united states supreme court and judges who strictly interpret the constitution of the united states of america
6988370 two of the best of those are judges alito and roberts you can be very proud of them my friends i want to tell you i will try to find clones of alito and roberts i will try to find people just like them

6988395 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6988396 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6988397 i think what happened today is encouraging but unacceptable until the last russian soldier leaves my country
6988398 what they are still doing making explosions camping by the road digging positions does not look to me like cease fire it looks like warfare

6988404 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6988405 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6988406 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6988407 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6988408 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6988409 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6988410 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6988411 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6988412 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6988413 qui est le nouveau dada enfourch par les manifestants de tout acabit
6988414 si les manifestants ont fait moins de bruit que ce quoi certains sattendaient les gens venus encourager les soldats eux ne se sont pas g n s pour distribuer les bonne chance les merci et les voulez vous un c lin
6988415 comme tous les militaires interrog s le soldat cloutier se disait d u que des manifestants aient profit de la journ e qui tait r serv e leurs familles hier pour venir exprimer leur opposition la guerre quon puisse tre contre la guerre je suis pour a 100 mais il faut appuyer les troupes parce que la reconstruction on la fait vraiment le soldat karel brault 24 ans s tait point la f te avec sa m re sa grand m re sa blonde sa belle m re et son fr re de 14 ans il part le 27 juillet et il a h te a va tre une belle exp rience une exp rience que je naurais jamais pu aller chercher ailleurs et puis on sen va l pour aider le peuple mais vous allez peut tre devoir vous battre contre les talibans mais les talibans on sentend que cest le mal
6988416 les manifestants qui voulaient hier d ranger aux soldats qui partiront sous peu en mission ont choisi le mauvais moment le mauvais endroit et les mauvaises cibles les militaires leurs proches et ceux dans la population qui voulaient leur manifester leur support avaient le droit de prendre la rue quelques heures sans avoir subir les d nonciations de ces m mes marginaux qui suppos ment au nom de la paix de la libert tentent toujours demp cher les autres dexprimer leurs opinions ou leurs sentiments cest bien connu il ny a pas plus agressifs que des pacifistes patent s
6988417 war is the remedy that our enemies have chosen and i say let us give them all they want
6988418 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the uncoordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
6988419 our reports from our own forces on the ground are only so far that those killed in the strikes were 30 and they were all militants
6988420 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
6988421 it is imperative that we exercise caution before jumping to any conclusions the issue of civilian casualties is so important that it is vital that we verify the facts of what has actually happened
6988422 it is a matter of great concern that we are seeing reports of large numbers of civilian casualties the first rule of any counter insurgency operation is to do no harm
6988423 people didnt accept the aid and started throwing stones at the soldiers saying the afghan army is our enemy we dont want anything from our enemies
6988424 we will continue our demonstration till the international community listen to us and bring those who carried out yesterdays attack to justice
6988425 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6988426 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6988427 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6988428 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6988429 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6988430 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6988431 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6988432 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6988433 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6988434 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6988446 this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6988447 i remember somebody making the comment that you know you ought to be able to take this thing to 5 000 participants easily to tell you the truth im not sure we want to do that
6988448 i think this is a better and more enjoyable run not only because of the scenery
6988449 but also because youre not dealing with 20 000 people
6988450 its a good idea for us to take baby steps to move slowly
6988451 stopping traffic for a while so 1 200 runners can move through the intersection of route 54 and the railroad tracks thats one thing when you talk about doing it for 5 000 runners thats kind of scary
6988452 sure youre always going to have people who grumble about road closings and traffic
6988453 but some grumbling is going to happen whether youre talking about 150 runners or 1 200
6988454 98 99 percent of the people love the fact that were doing this is there some inconvenience yes sure but just about everyone understands that this is just like any other community event that brings visitors to ashland most people i think like it this way most people want us to be known as a place where theres always something going on
6988455 what the buddhists want to do is keep the status quo
6988456 he looked at me and it was like his eyes were dead
6988457 i stared at him right in the eyes and it was like i wasnt there
6988458 he would get angry upset over anything he complained about the noise about anything that disturbed him
6988459 it went click then click and click again he fired three times davon stood there shaking nothing happened
6988460 he had just shot his nephew three times in the head
6988461 my son had terrible problems and we couldnt get anyone to help
6988462 we will all stand behind him even after what hes done he was not right
6988463 all this coaxing this being coy and planning to the nth degree is going to invite the most detailed critical scrutiny that youve ever seen
6988464 in spite of the fact that the rumored choices are all wonderful people none of them is jesus and none of them is moses even their friends can point out shortcomings
6988465 so this is going to be something that most people havent seen in their lifetime
6988466 if you let expectations get out of control and you cant satisfy them youve got yourself into a big hole

6988478 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6988479 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6988480 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6988481 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6988482 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6988483 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6988491 citizens end up paying more than they would have paid for the original product because they find themselves obliged to buy the same thing twice in a short period
6988492 the goods that result from counterfeit and piracy do not contribute to the states coffers because they come from an industry which is beyond the control of formal institutions

6988499 its the channels prerogative to select or reject a candidate until two days prior to the show i didnt even know who was going the format doesnt allow the host to know the contestants mr athavle claims he was dropped on discriminatory grounds because he was a dalit and sanjay nirupam was taken instead
6988500 why was i being blamed if a candidate didnt make it into big boss why were they throwing stones at the channel colors office and burning my effigy why me every time im associated with something people try to use my name for their own purposes please leave me alone
6988501 but really rakhi sawant takes the cake what authority does she have to make such charges against me

6988503 every minute there are new brain cells being formed in the unborn child and as the new brain cells are being formed pathways or circuits are being formed along the lines that help assist communication for whatever the child the needs for example the child will obviously need to breathe the child will need to move when he is born the eyelids will need to open and close so all these organs and all the nervous tissue that supply these organs has to start developing long before birth its the same thing with the brain circuits the more you stimulate a childs skin or the more you stimulate its auditory nerves hearing the more those pathways will develop and become stronger so that when the child is born he or she is better prepared for the world

6988515 i hope your column on colorado springs wrestler henry cejudo will give folks pause to reconsider their stance on undocumented immigrants from mexico whether they are wrest ling their way to olympic gold harvesting our fields or cleaning hotel rooms for the democrats these people come to the united states with the simple impulse to make life better for themselves and their kids they are no more lawbreakers than those who hire undocumented immigrants rather than pay americans working wages in fact the immigrants are far less culpable because their intentions are far purer
6988516 there should be a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of the scandal involving the chinese gymnasts its obvious to the world at least two of these girls were underage for olympic competition the u s was cheated of higher positions on the medal podium by a chinese policy that disregards the true sportsmanship of the games this matter should not be swept under the rug with a shrug of the shoulders
6988517 both jesse owens and jim thorpe did something way more important at the olympics than the eight gold medals won by swimmer michael phelps phelps should go down in history as the greatest swimmer ever thats a breeze compared to what thorpe and owens achieved
6988518 your views on phelps place in olympic history are laughable social significance this is sports you complete pc idiot phelps wasnt running for secretary general of the united nations if you spent any time off your doughnut eatin butt you might understand but you obviously are just looking to tear down the accomplishments of a man because he is white you racist pig in closing drop dead
6988519 i was appalled at the headline referring to the xl golden girl at the olympics why must discus thrower stephanie brown traftons size make any difference in her accomplishments perpetuating the belief large is bad and tiny is good only keeps young girls starving themselves to conform to american standards of beauty

6988521 right now with two teams out of it its all about pace of game so they call a lot of first pitch strikes so everyone starts swinging the bat its a frustrating way to hit
6988522 if im not patient im not doing my job if they continue to do that purposely i dont have time for that but thats the way its going to be the rest of the season ive seen it happen before
6988523 i was trying to finish the year strong and instead im basically spinning my wheels
6988524 its tough i want to make things happen im not here just to be here if i didnt care id just drag the bat up there and then drag it back to the dugout

6988551 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6988552 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6988553 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6988554 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6988555 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6988556 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6988557 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6988558 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6988559 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6988593 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6988594 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6988595 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6988596 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6988597 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6988598 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6988599 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6988600 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6988601 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6988602 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6988603 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6988604 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6988605 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6988606 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6988607 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6988608 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6988609 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6988610 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6988611 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6988612 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6988613 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6988614 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6988615 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6988616 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6988617 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6988618 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6988619 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6988620 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6988621 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6988622 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6988623 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6988624 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6988625 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6988626 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6988627 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6988628 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6988629 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6988630 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6988631 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6988632 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6988633 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6988634 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6988635 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6988636 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6988637 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6988638 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6988639 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6988641 sesungguhnya dunia itu adalah perhiasan dan sebaik baik perhiasan dunia adalah wanita shalihah
6988642 maukah aku beritakan kepadamu tentang sebaik baik perbendaharaan seorang lelaki yaitu istri shalihah yang bila dipandang akan menyenangkannya3 bila diperintah4 akan mentaatinya5 dan bila ia pergi si istri ini akan menjaga dirinya
6988643 tatkala nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menerangkan kepada para sahabatnya bahwa tidak berdosa mereka mengumpulkan harta selama mereka menunaikan zakatnya beliau memandang perlunya memberi kabar gembira kepada mereka dengan menganjurkan mereka kepada apa yang lebih baik dan lebih kekal yaitu istri yang shalihah yang cantik lahir batinnya karena ia akan selalu bersamamu menemanimu bila engkau pandang menyenangkanmu ia tunaikan kebutuhanmu bila engkau membutuhkannya engkau dapat bermusyawarah dengannya dalam perkara yang dapat membantumu dan ia akan menjaga rahasiamu engkau dapat meminta bantuannya dalam keperluan keperluanmu ia mentaati perintahmu dan bila engkau meninggalkannya ia akan menjaga hartamu dan memelihara mengasuh anak anakmu
6988644 empat perkara termasuk dari kebahagiaan yaitu wanita istri yang shalihah tempat tinggal yang luas lapang tetangga yang shalih dan tunggangan kendaraan yang nyaman dan empat perkara yang merupakan kesengsaraan yaitu tetangga yang jelek istri yang jelek tidak shalihah kendaraan yang tidak nyaman dan tempat tinggal yang sempit
6988645 hendaklah salah seorang dari kalian memiliki hati yang bersyukur lisan yang senantiasa berdzikir dan istri mukminah yang akan menolongmu dalam perkara akhirat
6988646 wanita itu dinikahi karena empat perkara yaitu karena hartanya karena keturunannya karena kecantikannya dan karena agamanya maka pilihlah olehmu wanita yang punya agama engkau akan beruntung
6988647 dalam hadits ini ada anjuran untuk berteman bersahabat dengan orang yang memiliki agama dalam segala sesuatu karena ia akan mengambil manfaat dari akhlak mereka teman yang baik tersebut berkah mereka baiknya jalan mereka dan aman dari mendapatkan kerusakan mereka
6988648 wanita istri shalihah adalah yang taat lagi memelihara diri ketika suaminya tidak ada dikarenakan allah telah memelihara mereka
6988649 tugas seorang istri adalah menunaikan ketaatan kepada rabbnya dan taat kepada suaminya karena itulah allah berfirman
6988650 jika sampai nabi menceraikan kalian 7 mudah mudahan tuhannya akan memberi ganti kepadanya dengan istri istri yang lebih baik daripada kalian muslimat mukminat qanitat taibat abidat saihat dari kalangan janda ataupun gadis
6988651 apabila seorang wanita shalat lima waktu puasa sebulan ramadhan menjaga kemaluannya dan taat kepada suaminya maka dikatakan kepadanya masuklah engkau ke dalam surga dari pintu mana saja yang engkau sukai
6988652 hr ahmad 1 191 dishahihkan asy syaikh al albani rahimahullah dalam shahihul jami no 660 661
6988653 maukah aku beritahukan kepada kalian istri istri kalian yang menjadi penghuni surga yaitu istri yang penuh kasih sayang banyak anak selalu kembali kepada suaminya
6988654 barangkali ada seorang suami yang menceritakan apa yang diperbuatnya dengan istrinya saat berhubungan intim dan barangkali ada seorang istri yang mengabarkan apa yang diperbuatnya bersama suaminya
6988655 demi allah wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya mereka para istri benar benar melakukannya demikian pula mereka para suami
6988656 jangan lagi kalian lakukan karena yang demikian itu seperti syaithan jantan yang bertemu dengan syaitan betina di jalan kemudian digaulinya sementara manusia menontonnya
6988657 maukah aku beritakan kepadamu tentang sebaik baik perbendaharaan seorang lelaki yaitu istri shalihah yang bila dipandang akan menyenangkannya bila diperintah akan mentaatinya dan bila ia pergi si istri ini akan menjaga dirinya
6988658 tidak halal bagi seorang istri berpuasa sunnah sementara suaminya ada tidak sedang bepergian kecuali dengan izinnya
6988659 diperlihatkan neraka kepadaku ternyata aku dapati kebanyakan penghuninya adalah kaum wanita yang kufur
6988660 allah tidak akan melihat kepada seorang istri yang tidak bersyukur kepada suaminya padahal dia membutuhkannya
6988661 demi dzat yang jiwaku berada di tangan nya tidaklah seorang suami memanggil istrinya ke tempat tidurnya lalu si istri menolak enggan melainkan yang di langit murka terhadapnya hingga sang suami ridha padanya
6988662 apabila seorang istri bermalam dalam keadaan meninggalkan tempat tidur suaminya niscaya para malaikat melaknatnya sampai ia kembali ke suaminya
6988663 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

6988666 there were a lot of nerves at the beginning of the game but after we got those first touches we calmed down and in the end we played pretty well together
6988667 they were quick on the ball and moved it well the freshman were able to play together and improved as we moved along
6988668 i thought the freshman played really well tonight and overall we competed well
6988669 santa clara is a fantastic opponent the problem was that they play at a speed that is different than what we have been training at so it took us a while to adjust to the speed of play
6988670 we played well at times and not so good in others
6988671 we started eight new player who had never played at a division i level and we went up against a nationally ranked opponent i saw a marked change from the beginning of the game to the end if we can continue improving we will be much better
6988672 i played against the guys in practice so it will be fun to compete against them in a different setting
6988673 i talk to guys all the time check on them see how camps treating them
6988674 everybody seems to be doing well i wish those guys the best
6988675 but we got a guy in the deal that has fit in well and made a lot of plays in practice

6988690 we alerted parents to make it easier on them its her life we wont tolerate prejudice we teach our kids understanding and tolerance

6988697 we comprehend that the displaced population is not living in an established camp or settlement this means that they access and consequently strain the social services meant for the indigenous population hence the need for intervention
6988698 what has really led a lot of this is the commodity prices having a bit of a bounce and we have had a pretty serious correction in those prices
6988699 you do tend to get a bounce off the bottom of those and thats what were seeing

6988702 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6988703 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6988704 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centred
6988705 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6988706 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6988707 people rarely get the chance to be part of an industry wide revolution changing not only the way their jobs are done but completely altering the way they look at their business
6988708 social media is changing the way we connect with others and learning how to harness that power is very exciting
6988709 its different from traditional media because it focuses on sharing and discussing very different from the one way communication of traditional media like television radio or print
6988710 we might yell at our tv set during a hockey game but no one else hears us go to a hockey blog rant as much as you want and someone else might see you and respond thats social media
6988711 you can share photos chat with fellow dog lovers get advice on knitting projects learn how to restore antique cars absolutely anything
6988712 and most social media based sites are free and easy to use which is why theyre so popular
6988713 businesses can use social media not just for marketing but for productivity to bring branch offices together and to share knowledge to help the business grow
6988714 the cost of entry is very low and if people are already using the web it takes very little time to learn these tools social media can directly impact the bottom line in sales and cost reduction
6988715 people are talking about your business whether you like it or not
6988716 you can either join in on the conversation or risk a loss of sales or a potential pr crisis
6988717 of course for the risks businesses engaged in social media also reap the benefits these tools can do wonders for networking and reaching your audiences it can help you reduce travel costs get better market intelligence and speed up business deals those are hard costs saved and money realized

6988719 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6988720 as we go into the fall we know for example that the price of natural gas is going to go up an average of 20 per cent
6988721 for a family that means about a 260 a year increase which when looked at in grocery terms is two or three weeks of groceries
6988722 its going to be quite difficult in the coming months in terms of their ability to put food on the table and to have a standard of living that is necessary
6988723 the rising price of gasoline energy food as well as tough economic times theyre coming together in a gathering storm
6988724 puts a few more steps into shopping looking around seeing what is the best bargain out there thats all you can do
6988725 hopefully the gas prices will level out a bit for the coming winter because thats always a problem too you cant get around as well
6988726 ive definitely rearranged what i buy where i buy and how i buy and i cant afford to drive the way i used to
6988727 public transit can be a blessing sometimes not as convenient but you do what you have to do
6988728 were starting to see the leading edge of the storm
6988729 we do some work in first nations community sandy lake located about 700 kilometres northwest of thunder bay
6988730 gas prices are even higher there 1 70 a litre it just absolutely and ultimately reduces your mobility
6988731 given theres already high rates of poverty were extremely worried about conditions in communities in northwestern ontario
6988732 the north and rural regions certainly are finding it difficult
6988733 the people coming in that cant pay their hydro bills and their gas bills and so theyre being shut off is increasing if you cant pay that you cant get food
6988734 peanut butter and jam i dont have i dont have any canned meat on my shelf i dont have the canned pasta on my shelf because theyre 1 a can the peanut butter went from 1 60 up to 2 20
6988735 so even for providing i have to make some choices
6988736 we are feeling the impacts of global economic factors beyond the control of any one individual or government
6988737 while over the course of the year we are projecting positive economic growth the outlook for real gdp growth in canada based on private sector forecasts has been revised down to 1 1 per cent in 2008 from 1 7 per cent in the budget projection
6988738 but theres still no sign flaherty is aware the canadian economy is in trouble
6988739 the conservatives continue to claim they will still hit 3 4 per cent in spending growth for the year but theyve proven throughout their term in office that they cant stop themselves from spending
6988740 the global economy is slowing and canada is not an island
6988741 all were asking is just to have a little share
6988742 this might be because factors other than name fluency have a more pronounced effect on stock price as time passes
6988743 well dad always buys us candy when he stops for gas
6988744 were looking to expand our manufacturing footprint and the number of dealerships in the region
6988745 we have a good product portfolio and are coming up with new products and looking for products for the market conditions
6988746 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6988747 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6988748 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6988749 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6988750 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6988751 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6988752 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6988753 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
6988754 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee

6988766 weil es in berlin kein zentrales register f r schulschw nzer gibt
6988767 hat der senat keinen berblick dar ber wann und wie bezirke polizei und schulen t tig werden
6988768 lediglich mit p dagogischen angeboten wie sie der senat bereith lt ist dem problem nicht beizukommen
6988769 dieses zentrale register hat sich als wertvolle unterst tzung bei der pr fung des verdachts auf verletzung der schulpflicht erwiesen

6988771 some people are born into this world who are just superstars and the ability he has with that cricket ball when he bowls is just second to none its absolutely phenomenal
6988772 he can bowl in practice with one arm and still hit a length and im fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can ask to knock the stumps over at the death and he bowls those kind of deliveries at the death hes brilliant
6988773 this is the stage he belongs on not playing for durham in front of 34 people he should be playing in front of 34 000 40 000 or 50 000 thats where steve harmison belongs

6988782 you can have anything you want you just cant have everything
6988783 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6988784 i didnt take senator bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
6988785 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that either the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
6988786 some have taken totally out of context my use of the word clean

6988832 several of the experts we have been talking to in preparation for this years designboost point to the importance of every city making the best of its inherent capacity to improve sustainability
6988833 general models for how cities ought to work with the complex notion of sustainability has often proved to be unsuccessful
6988834 of course there must be clear and well founded policies as well as explicit rules but apart from these all cities have to work on its own terms
6988835 it has become obvious that all so called models for sustainable development which do not regard humans ways of being but merely how we live are not working very well argues david carlson the other founder

6988839 he that is wounded in the stones or hath his privy member cut off shall not enter into the congregation of the lord
6988840 god loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life
6988841 if the end of the old testament states the end of the prophets why do you believe there were prophets afterwards
6988842 i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
6988843 because of christ i will be raised up to his everlasting kingdom
6988844 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
6988845 and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them
6988846 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses
6988847 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper
6988848 surely god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets
6988849 and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
6988850 and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands
6988851 and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee
6988852 saying prophecy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee matthew 26 68
6988853 and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying
6988854 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith
6988855 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head
6988856 to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
6988857 and thou i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have charity i am nothing
6988858 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edified the church i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except heinterpret that the church may receive edifying
6988859 quench not the spirit despite not prophesyings prove all things hold fast that which is good
6988860 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery 1 timothy 4 14
6988861 we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
6988862 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth
6988863 and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not believe him but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet
6988864 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it
6988865 and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways
6988866 as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began
6988867 but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
6988868 then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
6988869 now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul
6988870 and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them
6988871 and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus
6988872 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone
6988873 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his hold apostles and prophets by the spirit
6988874 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ ephesians 4 11 12

6989009 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
6989010 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games

6989018 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
6989019 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
6989020 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
6989021 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
6989022 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished
6989023 for pakistan it is better if the tournament is postponed rather than relocated because according to iccs contract with espn star sports it will have to hold the champions trophy within 13 months of its postponement that means that there will be a possibility that this edition of the champions trophy will take place in pakistan next year
6989024 we are ready to hold the champions trophy as we are the alternate venue for the tournament we are in a position to hold the champions trophy as sri lanka is the alternative venue for the icc event

6989033 ik had net zo goed in het hotel kunnen gaan kijken
6989034 ik stond alleen maar te kijken hoe de speelsters het deden want ze hoorden me toch niet
6989035 je ziet hoe ver deze ploeg is ze zijn zelfsturend daar ben ik trots op ze wisten precies wat ze moesten doen geduld hebben dan komt het vanzelf ik heb er zelf niet van kunnen genieten ik was te gespannen ze hebben mij in de rust zelfs gerustgesteld
6989036 topsport bestaat uit heel veel kleine procenten in nederland zijn we erg gefocust op techniek en tactiek maar we vergeten vaak het mentale voor veel sporters is de spanning van de spelen te veel daar kun je je op voorbereiden
6989037 ik probeer sporters bijvoorbeeld te leren dat ze alleen maar bezig zijn met de taak die ze tijdens de wedstrijd moeten uitvoeren
6989038 een waterpoloster moet vangen en gooien een hockeyster moet de bal goed behandelen en de organisatie in het veld op orde hebben dat valt te leren bijvoorbeeld door alle afleiding in kaart te brengen zoals het publiek dan bekijk je hoe je daarmee om moet gaan

6989051 ive grown a lot as a person and an athlete the past few years and its become my obsession i guess so its cool that its worked out
6989052 it started with just going to the olympics i was just a young athlete and it was a tough eye opening experience
6989053 i just got bundled out really early in the qualifying round but i got a chance to sit back and watch all the guys that made the final and i thought that i could be as good or better than those guys
6989054 i was part of tims preparation for that hes a good friend of mine and i got to witness what he did in the lead up competitions what he did around the village and what he did in his qualifying and in the final
6989055 he was so mentally tough he hadnt won that competition until he jumped that five metres 95 to break the olympic record he was behind the whole competition and i took a lot from that
6989056 he just stuck to his plan stuck to what he knew and hes been in my thoughts a lot the past couple of days
6989057 i saw him during the qualifying round he was sitting front row and i saw him after i had my third attempt clearance at 5 65 and he gave me a big smile and a thumbs up and i really took that with me and i wanted to replicate what he did four years ago and im really happy that i did
6989058 that definitely hasnt sunk in because im still the same guy i was yesterday i still havent slept so i havent had the chance to wake up and be someone new i guess
6989059 i thought my third attempt at five metres 85 was really dicey i thought id missed that to be honest i was going off to the side but i finished the jump anyway i count my lucky stars i cleared that
6989060 it wasnt the best jump id done all night and neither was my third attempt at 80 but those lucky clearances meant that i put together really good jumps at 90 and 96
6989061 i took a moment before i jumped at 5 90 and sat back and realised i was doing something that every kid dreams of i had my destiny in my own hands
6989062 russian rival evgeny lukyanenko was out of the competition if i clear that bar i am olympic gold medallist and i did think i was the sort of person who could stand up and take that sort of opportunity on and make the most of it
6989063 sailing over that bar it was a clean clearance i really got to enjoy it
6989064 i knew i was over it thats the good thing about my event you get that opportunity to fall to earth and thats an experience that no other people get to have in their events so im lucky to be a pole vaulter lucky to be an olympic gold medallist lucky to be an australian all sorts of things im a very lucky guy right now
6989065 so much time so much planning and so much effort so many sacrifices so much has gone into this for me there have been so many people supporting me through all of this this is not just for me this is for all of them its an amazing feeling and i hope theyre all feeling half as amazing as i am
6989066 its a really cool thing i feel like i deserve this and im going to enjoy it i love what i do and this is just icing on the cake
6989067 my whole thing at the moment is just about relaxing you know my best jumps are when im relaxed
6989068 i wasnt that relaxed at the start of the competition i was pushing too hard on the runway and i just really needed to let it go and as the competition went on i got more tired and i just had to do that otherwise i wouldnt have survived
6989069 one of my big changes for me is that i didnt think about the consequences of missing or clearing i was just in the moment for it i didnt think about the interviews i would have to do if i missed and came fifth at the olympics and thats something that in the past i have worried about
6989070 i loved being in a bit of a dogfight with evgeny i loved having third attempt clearances i loved it all being on the line

6989073 i bumped into him at sandy lane and we arranged a game not knowing what a demon he is
6989074 i saw stephen hunt of reading out there too and told him wed got a match against shev and his mate who turned out to be the pro at wentworth
6989075 we got an absolute battering it was all over after nine holes never mind 18
6989076 shevchenko plays off a four handicap and he looks even better than that
6989077 i think it will be a good move for him and hell be nearer his mum down in bournemouth id have been dead if id sold him to a club further north
6989078 fulham is a fantastic place for me to continue my career
6989079 i was frustrated at west ham because i wasnt playing as an international sitting on the bench was not enough for me
6989080 i needed to go where i could get more action so when fulham came in i was happy to join them because it is a great side and had a lot of prospects for me
6989081 i strongly disagree that we will be fighting relegation again this season
6989082 the coach came in late last season when the team was struggling but he turned things around
6989083 now from what i have seen so far we are building on what we did at the end of last season and i am confident that things will be much better
6989084 i didnt spend the summer celebrating i just spent it worrying about what we needed to do what we needed to change
6989085 we were 3 2 down in injury time and you get out with the draw you should be feeling lucky
6989086 but im not feeling lucky at all im feeling that game should have been dead and buried well and truly prior to that
6989087 when youre not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6989088 korea was a turning point for seol he went back there and realised what a big star he is in the country
6989089 i wasnt surprised at how big he was in korea hes a good looking boy who was a world cup star in a football mad country
6989090 but hes very well perceived over there despite the fact he hasnt made the grade in the premiership yet
6989091 you cant put that down to managers like lawrie sanchez and myself not giving him opportunities at this level you dont get many chances
6989092 if you get an opportunity and it doesnt work out for you at a place where the competition for places is strong you run the risk of not getting another chance
6989093 i changed a lot of things when i was 30 i knocked alcohol on the head even though i may have the odd glass of wine now and looked at my diet too
6989094 then theres stuff like yoga ice baths osteopaths massages loads
6989095 i train five per cent harder and get five per cent more out of my body each season to negate age a little bit
6989096 as you get older thats something you have to look at because youre not as quick or strong as maybe you once were
6989097 im doing my coaching badges so i am prepared when the time comes although id like to go on for a bit yet
6989098 the team is hungrier than in previous years you can tell we didnt win anything last year even though we effectively played three finals
6989099 thats one of the main reasons we are very motivated this year a new coach has arrived and brought in new people
6989100 every one of us wants to show he is in the team by right we want to get back to where we belong to be fighting at the top and to win a trophy
6989101 last year we changed coach we lost two finals and we only lost the league by two points there probably wont be anything that will disrupt the entire year like last time
6989102 his training methods are different to what we had before with mourinho we also have a new fitness trainer thats the main difference
6989103 both scolari and mourinho are similar in that they want to make the team like a big family thats important they both want a team that works and sticks together
6989104 esplorare il lato cattivo di questi personaggi proveremo ad esplorare il lato oscuro e fare in modo che i personaggi ce lo permettano
6989105 mikael silvestre came to see me at the end of the season and said he wanted first team football i agreed with him
6989106 he has given me nine years good service there is no point in holding onto a player who has lost his position to patrice evra
6989107 he is a really nice lad and a great professional
6989108 he was conducting his own affairs we knew the price we wanted and notified the clubs who were showing interest
6989109 mainly it was sunderland he went there last friday to discuss a move and he came back and was very positive about that
6989110 he was having a medical there and halfway through it he got a phone call to go to london and he ended up at arsenal
6989111 you could have been selfish and say you are going to be a reserve
6989112 benni is a very good player and will be staying
6989113 he is still short of match fitness but once he gets fit and sharp there is no reason why he cant play a major part for us this season
6989114 every club in the premier league has 24 to 25 players but you can only select 11 to start every week
6989115 the ones that played at everton have got the shirt because they performed well but it doesnt mean that the same players will start every week
6989116 the competition is there because you need it it keeps you on your toes
6989117 you want people vying for a place and when they are not in the team you dont want them sulking but working even harder
6989118 i dont look at personal records but i do look at winning things which have never been done before
6989119 no one had won three premier league titles on the run and we did that but four hasnt and no one has ever retained the champions league those are the targets this season thats the challenge
6989120 we certainly have the potential to do three and then four
6989121 as a youngster you just play off the cuff but when youve been around a while you realise whats at stake
6989122 you think this could be my last tournament or this could be the last league ill go for so you make sure you enjoy it
6989123 thats what i said to cristiano to enjoy the moment
6989124 i said that in 1999 i probably didnt enjoy it as much as last year you think times running out and are you going to get there again we did so i made the most of it and i was telling him to do exactly the same because those sort of games dont come round very often
6989125 i still get the same buzz out of playing and winning probably even more you saw in two minutes against newcastle last week how you can experience the highs and lows
6989126 i had a big collection of diana ross stuff her solo albums and others with her motown group the supremes
6989127 john absolutely loved them he always wanted me to put them on
6989128 being honest at the beginning of a new relationship and saying i have nothing left to give to this amazing person standing right in front of me
6989129 it was a very happy home with very little pain to deal with
6989130 it kind of gave me an unrealistic view of everything
6989131 ive looked back at some of these songs recently and thought to myself are you serious
6989132 i just love how true and raw their lyrics are
6989133 i get one line into one of their songs and i have to stop and write my own
6989134 their lyrics are that much more powerful because of the way they sing them
6989135 most nights id end up with an unfinished song but when the day would come when all the pieces would align and id know this is a song for people to hear there is no better release in the world those are some of the only times that i can go out at night or sit on the couch next to my loved ones and feel at peace like job well done i can rest at least for a second
6989136 i dont prefer being sad but its a real spot for me if you met me im not this dark sulking person though im not bubbly by any means either i guess it comes down to the fact that im not afraid of being sad
6989137 i have heard absolutely nothing from arsene wenger so i thought his comments really strange bizarre
6989138 it was an edgy nervous game because when you are one up your fans want to be reassured with another goal
6989139 he had a few opportunities to score the second goal and didnt do it give him time and watch him score
6989140 i cannot understand their disappointment with him his heart is with the club
6989141 the situation at tottenham is something i have never experienced and its not nice being out of the team
6989142 i wanted the manager to talk to me to tell me whats happened and tell me why im not in the team
6989143 roy keane and ramos are similar managers but roy talks more to the players than ramos did because of the language barrier i prefer having a manager like that
6989144 ive got a new team and i just need to play i wont think about spurs
6989145 ive left but i dont need to prove anything to anyone
6989146 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6989147 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club
6989148 its a glossy name and a load of bulls i think were giving young footballers too much too soon and when we ask them to give something back they are not capable of doing it
6989149 we need to go back to basics remember what we are about as a football nation young lads come in and we give them everything more and more at 16 we would play against men and if you didnt move quick enough you got kicked that was how we learned
6989150 we need to start working with the kids again and keep them hungry we need hungry fighters everything is done for them and theyre not being made to work hard enough to get there here the academy is much closer to the first team now
6989151 anyone doing well in the academy comes and trains with us for a couple of days a week
6989152 i understand why the gaffer went for the pace of marlon king last weekend but he knows i desperately wanted to play a part
6989153 last season our relationship was built on my understanding i wouldnt play every game

6989181 en el siglo xvii fueron muchos los moriscos que adoptaron la vida n mada haci ndose pasar muchas veces por gitanos para escapar de la expulsi n
6989182 ellos son ordinariamente m s te idos que los espa oles par cese a esos egipcianos que recorren el mundo
6989183 que en esta ciudad muchos vecinos de ella contra lo que su majestad tiene dispuesto tienen y encubren muchos moriscos as hombres a ni os y mujeres de los que no se han podido embarcar para berber a en los nav os que los han tra do del reino de valencia

6989187 se sabe se vuelven cada d a muchos y que las justicias lo disimulan
6989188 en el dichoarzobispado andan muchos gitanos que frecuentan con los moriscos y les ense an cosas de hechicer a y adivinaciones y supersticiones y les roban las ropas de sus casas y las bestias de los campos y que de ello se quejan y se escandalizan los moriscos de ver que tales cosas se consienten entre los cristianos

6989228 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
6989229 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
6989230 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
6989231 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
6989232 and he was like dont worry mon we got this one
6989233 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
6989234 id love for this to be a spark for the decathlon
6989235 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6989236 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6989237 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6989238 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6989239 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6989240 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6989241 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6989242 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6989243 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6989244 if you trust every web site but not a government
6989245 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6989246 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6989247 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6989248 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6989249 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including

6989263 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
6989264 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

6989273 we managed to mobilise each other to increase womens contestation by almost 50 percent
6989274 i didnt know this election would be so difficult but i wont go backwards i will definitely do it again and i know i will win next time
6989275 public awareness campaigns which demonstrate the vital link between the equal representation and participation of women and men in decision making positions democracy good governance and citizen participation
6989276 it doesnt matter what kind of structure comes up what we are interested in are the principles that will better serve us as women including an open democracy and non violence
6989277 while constantly deepening economic reform and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue to pursue comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
6989278 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
6989279 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
6989280 the leadership will be happy with the olympics and not just the gold medals but the performance of the people im optimistic that the values and tolerance learned during the olympics and the earthquake in sichuan will continue
6989281 the fact we are first in the gold medal table makes the world pay attention to china every chinese is very happy and proud the olympics forces china to be on the international stage
6989282 the olympics has been a great opportunity for china to learn some international things for example that audiences should not cheer tennis players as theyre about to serve
6989283 people who won bronze or silver or even no medals such as liu xiang or some athletes who could not compete because of their injuries or other reasons are all heroes

6989289 there is a real spirit cooperation with spain and us right now the good news is calderon and spain understand his injury is one that he should not play through if treated appropriately he should be fine for training camp
6989290 there are still some very wealthy people trying to get into the game tonight
6989291 yao ming talked about how he had dreamed of playing in the olympics since he was 5 years old
6989292 we need to have a uniformed policy on medical matters
6989293 even among the national teams you have a real inconsistency of care with no set of agreed upon guidelines between fiba and the nba
6989294 the quality of care is different between an nba team and national teams but its even different among the national teams themselves
6989295 in the especially poorer countries they dont always have the national team doctor at the tournament with them and theyre using a freelance doctor who may have or not have experience with sports injuries nor the understanding of the risk rewards of clearing a guy to play who has a 100 million contract
6989296 maybe we should do something similar to the soccer approach and limit it to players 23 and under the real question is whether or not the nba with our increasing global strength can create our own global tournament to replace the olympics and make money doing it
6989297 we come here with pride we play because we want to represent our country
6989298 college instructors are finding more and more quality online content for their classes and the psych files is unique in that it is aimed at students majoring in the soft sciences not just the techies and computer science majors who are typical consumers of podcasts
6989299 i try to show listeners how even complex theories can be readily understood and how these ideas can have an impact on their daily lives
6989300 as an almost daily commuter on amtrak ive seen first hand the need to prioritize the increased security and efficiency of our railroads
6989301 i think its time for me to go a little bit further
6989302 i have the potential to do that but you try not to look so far ahead go one match at a time just see what happens because once you get into the second week of the tournament anything can happen
6989303 i think im stronger mentally and physically my game hasnt changed a whole lot but when youre physically in better shape it gives you extra confidence
6989304 you go on the court just worrying about the tennis instead of other things it gives you a better peace of mind
6989305 its hard but i think if you want to win slams in any era you will have to have beaten great players to do it
6989306 nadal is obviously playing really well but i think this surface and grand slam he has struggled at he hasnt played his best here
6989307 federer is obviously playing really well but his performance has dropped a little bit and beating djokovic a couple of times the last month or so has given me confidence too
6989308 its very hard to do but its definitely not impossible
6989309 you have to go into for me anyway every tournament to win i always feel if you set a goal to reach the third round if you do make it to the third round you almost are satisfied with what you achieved
6989310 i lost a little bit of concentration in the beginning of the second set but then i felt i was finding my game again
6989311 it was too late to win the second set i came back from 1 5 to 3 5 before she won it but i got off to a good start in the third set and im really pleased with how i played that one
6989312 i guess i ran a out of gas a little bit after last week and the matches i played this week
6989313 but it has been a good tournament im pretty satisfied about the way i played throughout the week
6989314 it was a little bit tough to produce a good level of tennis without being good enough physically but i will stay on what i did in the first three matches and just look forward from here
6989315 i knew if i let her play her game and her decide the points it would be difficult for me to win
6989316 i was just running and it didnt pay off so i was just thinking i had to step into the court and play my own game and if it worked out it worked out i didnt have anything to lose anyway
6989317 im disappointed but its ok because i think i played a good match
6989318 i didnt have an easy draw i beat nicole vaidisova katarina srebotnik and daniela hantuchova three really big matches for me

6989326 joe biden traz uma grande experi ncia em pol tica externa um impressionante recorde de colabora o em todas as linhas do partido e uma atitude direta para fazer o trabalho
6989327 acho que a passagem pela vila ol mpica fez a gente valorizar muito esse bronze vimos o quanto os atletas lutam por medalhas e valorizam cada uma delas

6989331 the higher education market is clearly ready for aggressive adoption of podcasting technologies students regularly use supporting equipment ipods other brands of mp3 players pcs laptops and high speed internet
6989332 and if either of us meets someone who feels more like a soul mate i think we should tell the other and then just go with it we can deal with whatever needs to come after that
6989333 why do you want to spend your life giving out home relief checks
6989334 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6989335 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6989336 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6989337 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6989338 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6989339 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6989340 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6989341 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
6989342 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

6989352 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6989353 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth
6989354 every effort is made to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
6989355 god made you special and he loves you very much
6989356 im sick of drinking and smoking you know what i mean
6989357 i dont really smoke as much as i used to and im just looking after myself a bit better for me and my children i just want to live forever man i dont want to be not well
6989358 we dont really speak that much theres nothing to say
6989359 we speak if the music aint right we sort of pull each other aside and go look youre doing that wrong or youre doing that right and thats it really we see enough of each other on the stage
6989360 im cool with it theres things he dont like about me theres things i dont like about him i refuse to be like him and he refuses to be like me
6989361 the minute you tell someone someone tells that and then you end up paranoid and blaming people so i thought the best way to do it was to tell no one
6989362 were not god heads and we dont go to church or anything
6989363 its just were talking about love life religion death but not in a morbid way angels and shit like that it is what it is
6989364 people are sort of going on about this tribute to john lennon its not a tribute to john
6989365 if i tried to write a song about john lennon itd sound ridiculous so its just a song man you know people will have to get what they get from it you know what i mean i hate when people say its about this its about that because instantly people stop using their imagination and you just look for that
6989366 a very great honour for a little girl from charlemagne
6989367 if there is something that has guided my life its my wish to excel and go farther to the maximum of my abilities to the top of my goals my hopes and my dreams
6989368 celine dion is a citizen of the world who promotes canada wherever she goes
6989369 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6989370 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6989371 we really all work together here so it works really well for us
6989372 we dont have to hire people to man the shop because we always have an artist on duty
6989373 the biggest advantage is that we all have time to do our own thing
6989374 some of the art reflects the local setting but some of it is far ranging as well really out there there is something here for everyone
6989375 i think the media has made a whole lot of nonsense out of absolutely nothing and has gone on speculation and gossip
6989376 weve been respecting the process and making sure we have all the proper permits
6989377 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6989378 its the sea the sea and the proximity to nature
6989379 as soon as you arrive you can smell the difference air quality is so much better than many places in southern ontario without a shadow of a doubt so you can smell it immediately as soon as you get out of the airplane
6989380 we went up the cabot trail and it was wonderful because on the left you had the virgin timbers and on the right the ocean we ended up eating chowder and playing about 40 games of scrabble during a downpour in neils harbour and it was on that trip that we fell in love with nova scotia
6989381 i always wanted to do something beyond being a summer resident and i saw that a couple of properties had become available
6989382 they had seen better days but they offered lots of potential and they had great bones great potential so i think it was about five years ago i purchased des barres manor and it had not been used for at least a year and in a maritime environment if the building is unoccupied it goes bad on you so we rescued the building basically and put quite a bit of investment into it in terms of refurbishing the rooms and the bathrooms and a brand new kitchen and brought it up to the standard that its at now
6989383 the golf course was a going concern when i purchased it from a german investor but there had not been any investment in the golf course for quite a while and its a beautiful property
6989384 to go from a nine hole golf course to an 18 hole there are a lot of really good 18 hole golf courses in nova scotia and theyre very expensive to maintain and the economics are not all that great but a nine hole public course with the infrastructure that it has the access to the water and the clubhouse and the accommodations it has great potential i think
6989385 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6989386 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6989387 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6989388 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6989389 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6989390 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
6989391 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
6989392 mr glitter is offered only one option a flight to london
6989393 thats how i got quite a few wins they thought i was just a kid and couldnt play that well
6989394 theyre definitely playing theyre definitely getting better and theyve got some of the older players worried about that
6989395 it was really cool for a 13 year old it was a lot of excitement and i won us 1 000 which was a large part of it as well
6989396 when we started there were maybe six people under 18 not more than 10 for sure
6989397 and now theres maybe 20 or 30 at every u s nationals we go to
6989398 some of these kids honestly they were so serious i was really surprised at how serious they were they were concentrating and it was just quiet
6989399 if you asked them what do you learn by playing scrabble they would say well im just having fun but they dont understand the whole math and spatial awareness and letters and spelling and all that stuff
6989400 its a sort of fascinating game when you play an interesting word theres a beauty about it it sort of captivates you and makes you want to do it again and again
6989401 the words are there but theyre more like tools kind of to building a higher score
6989402 the way you use the board and the pieces and all of the letters have a different point value and so youre trying to use all of that to get the highest score
6989403 for young people its a lot easier to memorize things because when you get older you start losing your memory
6989404 but when youre young if you study your words you can remember them a lot easier
6989405 id always said id never write a book like this
6989406 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6989407 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6989408 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6989409 and he and about four other people would read that
6989410 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6989411 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6989412 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6989413 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6989414 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6989415 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6989416 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6989417 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6989418 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6989419 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6989420 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here

6989428 in georgia and russia a perfect brew for a blowup
6989429 united states and its nato allies impose a price on russia
6989430 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
6989431 to respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
6989432 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

6989439 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6989440 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6989441 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6989442 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6989443 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6989444 eat itll melt ill go get some buckets from the barn in case you want to take some of it with you come on out when youre done
6989445 i cant believe how good this is i thought itd be awful
6989446 they only have goats milk i thought itd be strong tasting
6989447 this place is incredible isnt it i heard they never had guests until ms finley died
6989448 well their financial advisor came every year and they did have deliveries from time to time
6989449 you werent kidding they grow all they even have a root cellar they actually use it
6989450 ill take them all that you have to spare what else is there
6989451 come on i have more ice cream lets celebrate i can plant more next year itll be so much fun oh i should have asked about the fruit
6989452 sure on the other side of the tree break behind the barn we have an orchard
6989453 you know next spring i might add a few more trees too
6989454 about a hundred yards that way mother found a perfect mound over there that gets afternoon shade but lots of sun during the morning and very early afternoon so she planted the strawberries out there weve always had more than we needed but we dont keep the birds out so most of them get used eventually
6989455 weve had a steady stream of strawberries to eat but next week i think ill have to start canning them
6989456 i have to go i go on at two willow took the bowl from him and thanked him for bringing jill out dont worry about anything here ill get the chickens in and feed the other animals wilhelmina likes me now shes probably waiting for you to go so i can come sweet talk her some more
6989457 im just trying to get into my professional context and be fully invested in that
6989458 one of the reasons im still here is that i realize that so many more lives are invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here
6989459 we had a group discussion about whether or not i should stay and wizzy told me she wanted me to stay
6989460 it has been a roller coaster ride and im not real fond of roller coasters
6989461 i have no frame of reference on how to deal with a situation like hughs family has had to deal with but ive learned a tremendous amount about being a human being from hugh
6989462 certainly it makes it good for the family to see that were out here trying as hard as we can
6989463 but i dont think that were trying to make the tragedy a giant issue any more than it has to be
6989464 its two weeks of your life that are important but not as important as your wife and her family and your family
6989465 but hugh talked to wiz and her mom and they told him you came here for a job
6989466 this is wonderful for our team and for our organization for the guys for the number of hours and years theyve invested
6989467 its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done ive got to get back to where im needed which is with my family wizzy was as much a victim in this whole thing as anyone to have to witness the things that shes had to see and go through the loss that shes had to endure thats not an easy thing
6989468 this tragedy is now a part of hugh as a person
6989469 its something that he and his family are having to deal with and as such hugh being a part of our team in an indirect way it becomes something we have to deal with so were doing our best to fight and do the things that hugh wants us to do and by doing that were trying to do the best for hugh and his family

6989473 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6989474 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
6989475 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
6989476 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6989477 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6989478 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6989479 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6989480 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
6989481 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

6989505 people in this country have terrible ideas about homosexuals which i think is because they dont know any better
6989506 our plan was simple one shop would at least need one attendant as simple as it may seem we were creating jobs

6989511 dallinizio della mia vita mio fratello stato per me non solo compagno ma anche guida affidabile stato per me un punto di orientamento
6989512 per me motivo di profonda gioia ha detto il papa prima di congedarsi dai presenti al termine della cerimonia che mio fratello adesso appartenga al collegio illustre dei concittadini onorari di questa bella citt cos castel gandolfo se possibile diventa ancora pi cara pi vicina al mio cuore dunque grazie per questo gesto anche da parte mia
6989513 dallinizio della mia vita ha aggiunto il papa mio fratello stato sempre per me non solo compagno ma anche guida affidabile stato per me un punto di orientamento e di riferimento con la chiarezza la determinazione delle sue decisioni mi ha mostrato sempre la strada da prendere anche in situazioni difficili
6989514 lei signor sindaco con le sue belle parole mi ha fatto ripensare agli anni trascorsi a ratisbona dove realmente la bella musica ascoltata in cattedrale domenica dopo domenica per me stata un conforto una consolazione una gioia intima riflesso della bellezza di dio
6989515 mio fratello ha detto ha accennato al fatto che nel frattempo siamo arrivati allultima tappa della nostra vita alla vecchiaia i giorni da vivere si riducono progressivamente ma anche in questa tappa mio fratello mi aiuta ad accettare con serenit con umilt e con coraggio il peso di ogni giorno lo ringrazio

6989521 significa ha detto che anche a castel gandolfo si apprezza la musica

6989523 i am excited by the opportunity to increase the exposure of bqueer in australia and new zealand and to become more travel focused despite a struggling us economy current statistics show that gay travel is growing at an amazing rate
6989524 in bqueer we have found a ready made solution for providing our clients with a first class gay directory and promotional tool which has a proven track record and well established presence on the web
6989525 the result will be a shock to the markets and is likely to push sterling and the ftse lower and bond prices higher in trading today
6989526 it seems that brown and darlings more generous interpretation of their fiscal rules has kept the uk out of contraction for now
6989527 the news brings to an end 64 quarters of consecutive growth and increases the likelihood that the bank of england will move to cut rates before the new year
6989528 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6989529 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6989530 we do not expect that his participation at the olympics even if he does well will cause a tidal wave of other gay athletes outing themselves
6989531 each athlete has his or her own set of unique circumstances be they family team or sports it might be easier for some to come out and more difficult for others
6989532 we know of many other gay athletes who have not come out and openly said that they are gay some of them have said so to team mates or friends but their sexual orientation is not yet out in the public domain
6989533 society thinks that many women who play certain types of sport are lesbians anyway it is like a default setting
6989534 woman are also in a supportive environment it is more accepted there and they make no big thing of it
6989535 we are both gay divers but thats about the only similarity two things we share out of thousands of millions of qualities and character traits
6989536 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together

6989585 those attacks are purely an effort to silence harass and drive out of the public square those who oppose them
6989586 thats the greatest concern i have the effort to intimidate and silence those who have different views ive had professors i greatly respect come up to me in dark hallways and tell me they agree with me but they wont stand up in a meeting and say so theyre afraid of the criticism theyll endure
6989587 those who want to promote conjugal marriage will be targeted

news csirt based in point of presence poa in each region that interconnects all the centres 250 organizations connected since january 2004 rediris is part of red es a government agency to promote

opera transmission at fast speed gt 10 mbs use of multicast to distribute the contents since may 2005 testing of multicast over ipv6 for the transmission of the videos could this increase the use of ipv6 slide 5 use of ipv6 some of the spanish universities are starting to use ipv6 http www uv es siuv cas zxarxa ipv6 wiki slide 6 ipv6 security we are not going to talk about ipsec and all the cryptographic stuff traffic labelling ip headers etc why ipv6 is more secure than ipv4 etc etc etc for this you can search in google cisco http www cisco com security services ciag documents v6 v4 threats pdf michael h warfield s iss presentation at first conference 2004 http www first org slide 7 ipv6 security we are not going to talk about ipsec and all the cryptographic stuff traffic labelling ip headers etc why ipv6 is more secure than ipv4 etc etc etc we are talking about what kind of attacks and intrusions can we expect in systems connected to a ipv6 network slide 8 ipv6 security we are not going to talk about ipsec and all the cryptographic stuff traffic labelling ip headers etc why ipv6 is more secure than ipv4 etc etc etc we are talking about what kind of attacks and intrusions can we expect in systems connected to a ipv6 network the same that are in ipv4 slide 9 why we need ipv6 lack of address in the current ipv4 protocol 32 bits directions lack of address in some geographic areas that connected late to internet asia latin america use of ip to interconnect devices home automation increase of the devices that need to talk in the net simplification of the protocol slide 10 ipv6 structure te increase of the number of address 4 bytes 2 32 addresses in ipv4 16 bytes 2 128 addresses in ipv6 usually a home user get 64 2 64 addresses from some isp to assign r for all the devices in his network header simplification no framentation use of optional header to specify data encryption routing etc device auto configuration slide 11 iit s ipv6 more secure encryptation ipsec is an integral part of ipv6 it s quite easy to stablish point to point encrypted communications no more password sniffing but what is the throughput of movil devices when encrypting the traffic you still need to stablish a complex certification structure pki certificates etc sometimes difficult to configure if you want to use ipsec from the point of view of a network monitoring how can determine if a traffic is correct can the intruder use ipsec to hide their connections slide 12 it s ipv6 more secure tunnels ipv6 allow to stablish tunnels between different systems and networks with ipsec allow mobility of the users same address with independence of the physical location mobile user allow remote connections to our offices but also allow to circumvent the security policy of the organization what s happening with worms and scan users exposed to attacks from outsider tunnels can be used also from attackers use of ipv6 tunnels to hide connection with botnets and compromised systems some operating systems configure ipv6 tunnels by default slide 13 it s ipv6 more secure end of the scans ipv6 will be the end of the worms and scanning end of the worms which worm is going to find an address to compromise if home users have more address than the current ipv4 internet but there are more methods to find system that scanning use of web search system like google to find machines to compromise logs from emails netnews irc etc modified p2p can be also used to look for ip address use dns brute forcing and zone transfer how are the users going to internally configure their network at the end a network administrator need some tools to manage his network and the same techniques could be used from outsider to find system slide 14 it s ipv6 more secure security elements almost all the networking companies announce support for ipv6 routers y firewall did they support ipv6 with the same quality that ipv4 sometimes the filtering is done at software level instead hardware this generate a higher cpu load for the same amount of traffic most of the time you need the last version of the operating system that requires a hardware upgrade as mention before how the firewall will manage the tunnels network ids ipv6 header has a variable size and the data can be encrypted so the ids need more power to analyse the application level data operating system are the ipv6 tcp ip stack as optimized as ipv4 stacks slide 15 it s ipv6 more secure applications most of the security problem are do not depent on the network buffer overflows brute force against weak password bad programming practices in web development ipv6 don t provide any response for th6s problems most of the attacks using ipv4 can be also be adapted to ipv6 cle can this attacks be recycled slide 16 indice computer recycling a practical example configuration of a ipv6 network attack demonstration solutions and future ways slide 17 recycling hardware i vax 3100 server it s not

6989729 groteske f lle dass die sicherungsverwahrung in ostdeutschland nicht galt f hrte zu grotesken f llen so musste die justiz in sachsen anhalt einen mann laufen lassen der wegen mordes und totschlags verurteilt worden war und die strafe verb t hatte seine verurteilung erfolgte im jahr 1992 damals konnte die sicherungsverwahrung noch nicht ausgesprochen werden weil diese nur bei straft tern m glich ist die nach dem 1 august 1995 verurteilt wurden die folge war dass der mann rund um die uhr von polizisten berwacht werden musste bis zu 30 beamte waren zu diesem zweck auf ihn angesetzt doch nicht nur in ostdeutschland ist die sicherungsverwahrung umstritten gewesen auch im westen deutschlands gab und gibt es erhebliche bedenken gegen die ma nahme die nach ansicht des t binger strafrechtsprofessors j rg kinzig eine haft f r noch nicht begangene straftaten darstellt als im rechtsausschuss des bundestages experten stellung nahmen erkl rte kinzig es gebe erhebliche verfassungs und menschenrechtliche bedenken gegen die ma regel

6989733 30 m rz 2007 gef hrliche straft ter k nnen in ostdeutschland k nftig auch dann in nachtr gliche sicherungsverwahrung genommen werden wenn sie vor august 1995 straff llig wurden der bundesrat billigte am freitag in berlin einen entsprechenden bundestagsbeschluss seit jahresbeginn hatten einige f lle f r wirbel gesorgt in denen verurteilte sexualstraft ter nach ihrer haft entlassen wurden obwohl sie weiter als gef hrlich eingestuft waren im einigungsvertrag war die anwendung der sicherungsverwahrung auf dem gebiet der neuen bundesl nder ausgeschlossen worden sie kann bisher nur f r t ter angeordnet werden die straftaten nach dem 1 august 1995 begangen hatten diese gesetzesl cke wird nun mit der neuregelung geschlossen
6989734 in the early 90th many of us became aware of the urgent need to deeply change the prevailing economic patterns and our ways of life to become more sustainable instead of merely
6989735 mike and i have cleaned the tunnels but they are old coal tunnels theres only so much we could do
6989736 as long as delphie isnt going out theres one for each of us
6989737 i dont like those tunnels too many sad spirits down there
6989738 this is all my fault if i hadnt let the driver take me home the paparazzi would have never found us

6989740 if vals staying well have to get some more of these coats
6989741 you can unlock this deadbolt with a key from both sides of the door this old lock can only be opened from the inside
6989742 we usually leave the old lock open when we go out through the tunnels but with all this attention
6989743 i dont feel comfortable leaving it unlocked there are two locks at the workshop those are regular key bolts theres also a security system in the tunnels thats connected to both doors you can turn off the system from inside the castle or inside the workshop it goes back on when either the door is closed at the other end or thirty minutes passes
6989744 this box has the key to the deadbolt in it it will open to each of our birthdays our birthdays are the security code as well
6989745 no im torn between bashing his teeth in and puking
6989746 theres also flashlights and head lamps if you need them just toss them in the baskets at each end since were so late we should probably skip the headlamps and hold hands
6989747 theres a series of stairs eight stairs and three landings on this and twelve stairs on the other end
6989748 maybe we just feel all the sad souls delphie was talking about
6989749 were almost there you can see the stairwell up ahead
6989750 this box has keys to the door as well as key to the cars i thought mike would take his bronco

6989761 he came some time around midnight he was there for a while before he found katy he told everyone at the hospital that he was going to take katy from her hospital bed he tried to get the doctor to say that this proved that you were a bad mother
6989762 i im not a very good mother i try i really try i love her so much but she gets sick or hurt that doctor dr drayson he gave me an epi pen for myself and one for katy when she gains some weight i i didnt even know they existed and theyre like a hundred dollars a piece and

6989764 theyre going to take her my katy shes in custody of social services
6989765 no jill stop it youre freaking out for no reason
6989766 you need to hear what happened stop the hysterics and listen
6989767 they filed a report against trevor the hospital social worker said shed never seen a person so angry and out of control around his hospitalized kid she felt that he was an imminent threat to katy and to you he said he was going to kill you
6989768 he went to your apartment to find you i called the cops and he was cited but let go jill
6989769 i left a message for diane radman last night remember your lawyer shes already been to the hospital shes going to meet us at the courthouse diane was able to get a couple people to testify this morning she thinks youll finally get that restraining order

6989782 youll see from these documents that lipson construction is owned in its entirety by jacob and valerie marlowe lipson
6989783 four and a half years ago jacob and valerie marlowe lipson purchased the remaining shares of lipson construction from their father for ten million dollars
6989784 at that time there was a seven year plan was set into motion converting lipson construction from private owner to an employee owned company the initial transfer of ownership began at the beginning of this year and should finish within the next three years
6989785 at the time of the lipson construction purchase six trusts were set up
6989786 each of your mothers children received a one million dollar trust payable on their twenty fifth birthday in the event that mr lipson does not remain married to your mother she will receive a two million dollar trust you will also notice that only mr lipsons children will inherit wealth or possessions from mr lipson youll notice your mothers signature here and here

6989790 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
6989791 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6989792 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbour instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
6989793 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6989794 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6989795 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6989799 if they had not been cleared they would not have participated in the games
6989800 its only because there is a rivalry between the chinese and american womens gymnastics teams that these questions have arisen
6989801 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6989802 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all

6989810 i dont know who is going to the convention from my caucus what i do know is that our number 1 priority is to solve the budget
6989811 i cant justify going when we dont have a budget
6989812 given the fact that the legislature is over two months past their constitutional deadline and our state faces a looming cash crisis most californians will probably be disappointed to hear that the assembly has chosen not to hold session for most of next week
6989813 i cant imagine anyone going so if anybody goes there and theyre not here then i think all hell will rain down upon them
6989814 we ought to be here and the public ought to be outraged if were anywhere but here
6989815 if we dont have official work that were supposed to be here doing here part of our job as democrats is to help elect our next president
6989816 i was gung ho about going to the convention but im going to take it one day at a time

6989831 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
6989832 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
6989833 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
6989834 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
6989835 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

6989854 bagi mereka sekularisasi bukan penerapan sekularisme tetapi ia satu proses islami yang termeteri dalam kalimah syahadah
6989855 ini cukup mengelirukan sekurlarisme yang dipegang kuat oleh golongan ini selama lamanya tidak diterima dalam islam ianya sangat bahaya dan harus diwaspadainya
6989856 bagi mereka semua agama sama semua agama mengajar tentang kebaikan dan membawa kepada tuhan yang sama dengan cara yang berbeza
6989857 kita mengakui kewujudan pelbagai agama dalam negara tetapi tidak sampai mengakui kebenaran semua agama pemikiran ini menafikan kebenaran agama islam ia juga seharusnya bercanggah dengan fundamentalisme semua agama di malaysia seperti kristian hindu buddha dan sikh

6989861 mushaf uthmani ialah yang terbaik walaupun yang lain tidak dibenarkan untuk sebaran am kita tidak perlu menafikan imla i baghdadi fatimi atau alifi
6989862 yang terdapat dalam dunia islam hari ini juga merupakan al quran ini dipersetujui secara ijmak oleh semua mazhab islam
6989863 kita perlu ingat cendiakawan kristian sendiri percaya terdapat percampuran antara kalam tuhan dengan kalam manusia semua cendiakawan kristian sepakat bahawa daripada 240 000 manuskrip bible tiada dua pun yang menyamai ini tidak berlaku kepada al quran
6989864 ya kita boleh ada tafsir dari pelbagai sudut tetapi tafsir dalam islam bukan untuk menguji nilai kebenaran al quran kerana al quran itu keseluruhannya ialah kalamullah
6989865 contohnya poligami mesti diharamkan ini menunjukkan secara terang mereka terlalu liberal hingga nas teks juga ingin diliberalkan
