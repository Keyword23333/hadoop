1500253 cuidado pode causar sorrisos extremos e riso hist rico quando usado isso completamente normal
1500254 isto parte de uma tend ncia preocupante de roupas n o apropriadas sendo promovidas entre crian as
1500255 eu n o acho que o c u vai desabar por causa disso mas acho que isso faz parte de uma tend ncia cultural maior de vestir as crian as e fazerem elas se sentirem como adultos sexy
1500256 you will pay the price for what you are publishing
1500257 it became clear that what happened in the assembly of representatives was a big very dangerous conspiracy against the democratic process the constitution and mostly the people of kurdistan and the gains acquired for kurdistans people in the constitution
1500258 arabs and turkomans insist on the iraqism of kirkuk and refuse to revive the 140th
1500259 while we continue to learn from other countries we would be more than willing to share our experiences for the benefit of our commonwealth friends and the wider world
1500260 climate change is making agriculture especially in developing countries unpredictable and unproductive
1500261 unproductive agriculture results in hunger which sometimes breeds violence and insecurity
1500262 and yet deforestation and destruction of water sources continues unabated especially in poor commonwealth countries
1500263 the key word is partnership how to forge partnerships between various world blocs and agencies calls for full commitment by both developed and developing countries
1500264 individual and joint country challenges particularly through parliaments must be undertaken to invest in agriculture together with the research that goes with it
1500265 parliaments and parliamentarians are at the heart of the democratic process however one of the great problems we face in so many places is how to get the animosity the antagonism and the conflicts out of politics
1500266 my personal observation of the cpa and how it conducts itself is very similar to a democratic government that i know of very well
1500267 when i came to know of the succession plan between wanita umno chief tan sri rafidah aziz and her deputy datuk seri shahrizat abdul jalil i was initially shocked it was something no one expected
1500268 however after giving it much thought i feel that the succession plan in wanita umno is something positive which will stabilise the movement and also umno overall
1500269 the succession plan will enable wanita and umno to concentrate on strengthening the party and the government
1500270 all accepted the decision well including party president datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi as it would be in the interest of the party
1500271 currently this is something good as it takes into account the interest of wanita and umno
1500272 it is up to the movement to decide as far as i know there was no directive
1500273 the seven buses are under the care of a mosque and the drivers are employed by a government agency they provide free bus service to the people in the area
1500274 such moves would help the people in some small ways
1500275 at the moment we are studying the details such as who will be eligible the quantum and the family size involved
1500276 they want to increase their income the halal way not through the wrong means
1500277 we cant be telling them to celebrate hari raya in the cities they want to celebrate with their loved ones in their home towns
1500278 i want to do things fast to help the people but sometimes they just take time
1500279 im happy to see the progress of this project which proves that the government is concerned about the poor and development in the rural areas
1500280 i have to work hard to earn a living but can never get a good income as my family has never had land
1500281 we advised them not to use carbon fibre straps because of its limited ductility but the department proceeded with using the carbon fibre straps
1500282 i will talk to the aca when the time comes
1500283 for now i would like to meet my family first
1500284 the people can help the aca too if they think something is not right they can always complain to the agency this is for transparency
1500285 according to a witness from celcom haizal hambali the base station coverage overlaps from one area to another it was also established that no signals could be obtained to complete call transactions at hilly areas while a low signal would be captured in jungle areas
1500286 the arrangements of the call log structure and column were also incomplete and not organised
1500287 further another witness from celcom nik kamarudin nik ka testified that he did not know if the data in the logs were manipulated or altered
1500288 there were also mistakes in technical terms for smses and calls made in the logs this proves that the computer printing these documents was faulty and that the information contained was inaccurate
1500289 until yesterday monday the registry had been working hard i dont know why this case has so many unfortunate incidents one of the computers got a virus and they had to re type everything
1500290 i have requested the registry to triple its efforts even work overtime they said they need at least a month to finish everything
1500291 i want to make a decision by december i hope you will bear with me i am trying my level best to complete your case by year end
1500292 any examination of the documents will be done in the presence of the deputy registrar and must be in a secure room this is also extended to the prosecution
1500293 abuse torture and dehumanised treatment of migrant workers at detention camps
1500294 the list has served as a good guide in boosting our nutritional wellbeing
1500295 i have switched from buying white to wholemeal bread after learning that the latter has a higher fibre content
1500296 we have also cut down on our original intake of pork after seeing that red meat is excluded from the meal plan
1500297 it is important to eat as healthily as possible but we need to divert slightly from the menu plan at times for the sake of variety
1500298 after all variety is the spice of life and my children love the assam fish i cook
1500299 i will steam the chicken with traditional chinese herbs sprinkled with spring onions
1500300 when discussions centre on sensitive matters such as religions or ideologies that could lead to misunderstandings and conflicts such talks should be avoided from being held in the open
1500301 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constititution subashini and shamala revisited
1500302 this is an age old recipe handed down to me by my mother in law i need that many chickens to get the right consistency i deep freeze the chicken stock in containers and take them out whenever i need it i used to do this when my children were toddlers to make their porridge
1500303 when i was growing up we ate typical baba nyonya food and spoke malay at home now at home we speak english and eat chinese food as well
1500304 it was an honour for us when the un and its interim force in lebanon or unifil chose us to serve in the middle east country
1500305 we will be sending 230 peacekeepers there by october including five army personnel from the royal brunei armed forces
1500306 currently we have about 365 personnel serving under malcon east this will increase to 590 when malcon west joins them
1500307 already an experienced and established hairstylist who has over 100 outlets in india has been engaged to provide training for the youths
1500308 youths from india will be in malaysia for about one to two months for practical training in similar courses
1500309 the ministry will also provide other forms of training for youths interested in going into the food hotel or catering industry
1500310 we want them to be professional chefs at food outlets or restaurants which are now being monopolised by cooks from india
1500311 we also put forward a proposal to najib for all indian trade bodies including goldsmiths tourist operators news agency associations barber associations and metal traders to be registered and placed under the chamber
1500312 the problem we now face is that most of these bodies are not registered so it is difficult for us to assist foreign workers who are victimised by their employers
1500313 he cost him a bloody fortune but hes a fantastic horse and is capable of competing at olympic level
1500314 im calling him andre after pete his competition name is the b locks
1500315 im going to be training every day and ive already developed a six pack from where ive stepped up my riding im taking it really seriously so dont write me off for 2012
1500316 i have been given a seven minute slot at the horse of the year show to do a routine to music
1500317 we are very upset and sorry this is happening the free spot will go to cassara
1500318 i do not have any proof but if i did not take the drug which is found in the samples it could have been put in a bottle or a flask
1500319 johnson wrote to us to say he considered the medal was not won honestly and he was returning it
1500320 its the best job in the ioc because you have the honour to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1500321 at least i am convinced that we have a very strong team for the olympics
1500322 i believe kim kirchen is the rider whose characteristics are best suited for this course we saw he was very strong in the tour de france
1500323 he is the fastest of the three and he is the most dangerous
1500324 for many of us it will be the last time we compete in an olympic games so we will approach it with more intensity and more emotion
1500325 were one of the most important teams in the race but germany and italy are also strong
1500326 and we have to remember this is not the world championships its the olympic games so it is completely different from other types of racing
1500327 manteniendo al mismo tiempo la seguridad e intimidad del usuario
1500328 the teams preparations have been good the best i could expect and theyre all on the best form of their careers
1500329 that just means were on the right track and on target to reach our goal of a top eight finish
1500330 youre underestimating azizul hes just getting better and better and will continue to do so in the next few years
1500331 azizul is up there with the best at the moment as far as speed is concerned
1500332 we still have some work to do on the tactical side of things but hes coming along nicely
1500333 i would like to serve my country in the political arena in the future
1500334 he has contributed a lot to the country his businesses offers employment to hundreds of his people
1500335 my names come up in something and its not true
1500336 i have met him heredia before and when he was talking to me i told him i dont believe in this stuff
1500337 i have met with a lot of people who wanted me to try this and that everyone wanted me to work with them but me getting anything or doing anything i have not
1500338 my stance has always been that there is no place in our sport for drug users
1500339 i know ill be clean and im hoping everyone else in the field will be but i cant speak for them
1500340 it is something that we guard dearly our clean record
1500341 sergio wont be leaving for beijing because of his health
1500342 i feel great i feel fit healthy and ready to go im playing well so its going to come down to whatever happens on the day out on the court and i think ive got as good a chance as anyone especially at this time
1500343 i know because i wasnt able to play at the start of the year the main thing for me was being at the olympics and when i wasnt sure when i was going to be able to come back i just kept saying it is going to be alright for the olympics because that was the only thing i wanted to play all year if i could do anything
1500344 its definitely one of the main tournaments for us and you want to try and peak this week and see what you can do
1500345 playing tennis we are used to showing up at places one or two days before and i was here seven days before so i think if im ever going to be ready for a tournament i think it should be this one as far as being used to the weather goes
1500346 its very hot very humid and the suns not even out yet so it can only get worse from here
1500347 its unpredictable and probably the hottest conditions we are going to play in all year
1500348 fiona has been ruled out of her first olympic games but will remain in beijing to suppport her teammates
1500349 she wants to be here and that is a positive move
1500350 she is part of the junior leadership group and has a future not only as a player but as a leader in this team long term
1500351 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1500352 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1500353 i had the time of my life at those games winning the gold medal was one of the highlights of my career
1500354 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1500355 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1500356 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
1500357 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
1500358 its my understanding that park says hes going to swim under the world record and if he intends to do that hes got a very good shot at gold
1500359 theres a reason it has been a very difficult world record because it was set by ian thorpe whos a phenomenal swimmer
1500360 its a tough record i think were were still a little bit away from it
1500361 well have to see what happens park has said hell break it well wait and see how well he swims and what he can do
1500362 hes a very good competitor hes the current world champion im looking forward to racing him and giving him a good race
1500363 id love to have my personal best time in it thats probably my goal by how much im not sure
1500364 my expectation is to do it better than ive ever done it before better than the last two olympic games 2000 was tough athens was extremely tough
1500365 in the past we were a strong team we had a lot of good results but for various reasons our performances have been up and down
1500366 in training we have focused on two things creating team unity and also training hard and raising technical standards
1500367 but we are still some distance behind the top teams in the world
1500368 i am not a picky coach and i will not complain about the mess i am willing to accept the challenge and help our womens team out of the deep end
1500369 spain are a team we respect weve played them a lot of times and many matches were very close
1500370 not so long ago success in business came from sucking up to the boss and toeing the company line now it comes from blowing up industry dogma and out maneuvering the old guard
1500371 this is surprising since an earlier measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1500372 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1500373 if you are either obama or mccain you want to get over the 50 per cent line with women
1500374 although women credited hillary with clearing the path for future aspirants theyre much less certain it will be her or when that will be
1500375 many of these women intuit that whoever wins this election will be a one termer but it may also be a function of the feeling that hope springs eternal
1500376 an ideal customer can be a life insurance sales representative a financial advisor or a traveling executive who spends lot of time outside the company
1500377 sales channels to directly target these particular corporate and institutional groups
1500378 open tech computers are now on sale we have officially launched all products in our web store
1500379 agreed on the proposal to expand the eus role in resolving the conflict in the abkhazia region
1500380 welcomes this decision as an important step in strengthening the role of the international community in resolving the separatist conflict
1500381 the eus move will help break the discredited monopoly held by the russian federation in providing security on the ground and in facilitating the peace process
1500382 we have asked the developers of the potential moynihan station to come back to us with another plan that particularly features the subject weve been talking about today transportation
1500383 already we have addressed with them the dwindling supply of revenues that we as the state can put into the plan and were expecting an answer form them within a week or two
1500384 there is a point that the listener correctly has addressed that if is starts to become too costly a lot of these projects that we were for we may have to change our minds
1500385 to this point we dont think that were there with the atlantic yards and continue to try to help them
1500386 dow jones industrial average surged 330 points as oil prices continued to fall and the federal reserve kept interest rates unchanged

1500403 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1500404 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1500426 when nigel told me of his intention to change over to open country i thought i would just stay with fonterra
1500427 i had no axe to grind with them and i was happy to leave the status quo as it was
1500428 i have no problem with supplying them i want to supply them
1500429 we considered the application for dual supply but have declined it because of the commercial risk to fonterra and its farmers
1500430 if one farm dairy is used to supply two different companies one company will be disadvantaged with the supply of peak and shoulder milk the issue becomes about the ability of that shed to switch milk between the two suppliers it is not in our best interests to allow that to happen
1500431 there was a contract in place relating to the constitution for that farm dairy
1500432 fonterra is happy to collect all of the milk it was not us who broke any contract the parties broke the relationship not us
1500433 we have asked the developers of the potential moynihan station to come back to us with another plan that particularly features the subject weve been talking about today transportation
1500434 already we have addressed with them the dwindling supply of revenues that we as the state can put into the plan and were expecting an answer form them within a week or two
1500435 there is a point that the listener correctly has addressed that if is starts to become too costly a lot of these projects that we were for we may have to change our minds
1500436 to this point we dont think that were there with the atlantic yards and continue to try to help them
1500437 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1500438 an explosive device adame may have been handling at the time had exploded killing him almost instantly
1500439 several buckets full of items used to construct pipe bombs
1500440 im trying not to overreact but then i dont want to underreact to this
1500441 we expect hell be released from the hospital in a day or two and expect him to be back in the office in very short order
1500442 im worried about the ability of the population to maintain itself in montana

1500465 both the choreography and the score for victorious represent the two creators in a winter mindset they come into relative then perfect melodic harmony and pull away again continually
1500466 i had heard of the sankofa program and knew it was one of very few programs of its type on a college campus but when i got here i felt lucky to be a part of it
1500467 support and enthusiasm was even greater than when i was teaching in the fall
1500468 as i began to work on this piece i shared a rhythmic sound and movement language i had generated with the dancers and asked each of them to participate in creating the dance in handing these sounds over to them i drew upon my knowledge of rhythm tap and my studies with the great african american choreographer donald mckayle who was strongly influenced by the dances of caribbean cultures he fused these influences with mainstream modern dance techniques to create a fluid grounded and rhythmic style of contemporary dance

1500481 students have crafted an impressive display of new choreography brought to life by the most skilled and expressive young artists from one of the countrys leading departments of dance
1500482 this dance form is an affirmation and celebration of cultural marginality through communal dancing
1500483 i hope to bring to life the energy and emotion that i feel when i listen to these two pieces of music beethovens music is sophisticated and complex so my goal for the work is to choreograph two pieces that dance with the music rather than to it
1500484 remember how i said i wanted a lawn with sprinklers

1500490 i asked pam what she wanted to do 30 years later
1500491 we also now understand the significance of the boxer marcel cerdan who was the love of her life so he features prominently in the new play when he died in a plane crash she went on the road of self destruction
1500492 elena can really sing these piaf songs and tap into the grit and sex of them its a raw passionate performance
1500493 she can play the 17 year old piaf on the streets the woman in control of her career and her men through to the horrors of the morphine and alcohol addiction of this tragic star
1500494 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1500495 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverand jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

1500497 the analysis in this paper assumes that the entire observed change in heart attacks is attributable to the smoking ban
1500498 one cannot rule out the very plausible alternative hypothesis that the observed decline in heart attacks is explained by random variation in the data and the already existing secular trend of declining heart attacks in scotland
1500499 we might even say that the smoking ban caused a rise in heart attacks in wales
1500500 we believe a new graphics architecture will deliver vastly better visual experiences because it will fundamentally break the barrier between todays raster based pipelines and the best visual algorithms

1500534 he just wants to eat his lunch and he has a thousand people around him
1500535 we australians are all pretty good like that obviously you are starstruck and you are in awe of them but i dont think its appropriate to put him in that position
1500536 but i think i only slept about five hours the whole weekend i had a lot of difficulty concentrating when i was on the track
1500537 i think i would have had another shot at the podium if we had gone the full race
1500538 me and patrice we tested two weeks before the race in 05
1500539 and i really started to enjoy the track and after that ive had some strong results there
1500540 at mosport for example we already had a good base set up to work with and we just had to make little changes from there its a lot easier to go through a weekend when you have that
1500541 i always had a good relationship with benoit even when he was racing against me
1500542 he understands what its like to be a rider and what a rider wants
1500543 pascal has a lot of experience and when he helps us with set up he usually sends us in the right direction
1500544 ive got a bit of a cushion in both championships and with two races this weekend ill be pushing to increase the gap some more i won the 600 race at shubie last year and got fourth in superbike
1500545 so a repeat in 600 would be good and a win in superbike this time out would be what im shooting for we had a great setup for both the zx 10r and zx 6r at mosport and im confident well achieve that at shubie
1500546 mosport was definitely a disaster for me but im not dwelling on that my focus is on the three remaining rounds ill have had two weeks to recover from my injuries and i should be close to one hundred percent at shubie
1500547 its a very physically demanding track theres really no place to take a rest but im confident ill do well and start reeling in some valuable points this weekend
1500548 the track had to be ground in the new sections turns four and 12 and theyre like glass
1500549 as soon as i got to the new turn 12 corner
1500550 i turned in and rode across the new ground down section i didnt even pick the throttle up or anything but when i was on it the rear tire just slid out from under me went to full lock and threw me over the highside i almost hit the ground running i was going so slow
1500551 we cant run it as it is because the direction of crashed bikes is leading them directly back on the track and wiping people out
1500552 robertino pietri laid it down there i think on his out lap and it still ended up out in the race line so were trying to figure out a short term solution so we can race for the weekend coming up and a better long term solution
1500553 keith perry team m4 emgo suzuki crew chief made the call
1500554 he said this isnt testing this is more trying to not tear anything up so he called it quits
1500555 both bostroms ben and eric were up there jamie hacking miguel duhamel and neil hodgson and myself and josh herrin and josh disalvo
1500556 and we were looking at it and looking at possibly saying why dont we just run it straight make a straight line through the grass between the old and the new and straighten it out for a long term thing it keeps you away from the wall on riders left which is the reason why they made it and you wont have to worry about a bike coming across the track and hitting you either
1500557 you boys play really well together but if you sing another note youre fired

1500573 no provision of this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed as clarifying or implying that internet bets or wagers other than sports bets or wagers which were accepted subsequent to october 13 2006 are in violation of federal law
1500574 federal internet gambling prosecutions have involved sports betting creating a lack of authoritative court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal statutes to internet poker and casino style gambling
1500575 previous federal case law re mastercard 2002 made it clear that existing federal criminal law wire act of 1961 applies only to sports wagering and not to internet poker further the uigea itself states no provision of this law shall be construed as altering limiting or extending any federal or state law thus h r 6663 only confuses a clear judicial standing on this matter
1500576 contradicts its own rule of construction by implying in its findings that the sites on which millions of americans currently play are offering poker services in defiance of federal law

1500593 its time to stop the games and start focusing on solutions like creating good jobs through my energy plan
1500594 we can use energy sources we have here in vermont creating electricity from wind and solar power and heating our homes with renewable resources my comprehensive energy plan helps vermonters pay for energy saving home improvements so they use less fuel and save money
1500595 great response to my energy plan when i speak about it on the campaign trail this spot will help us reach more vermonters with our message of fundamental change
1500596 i think it is especially important for the millions and millions of independents who are not particularly enthused about either party to understand why barack obama is by far the superior candidate in this campaign
1500597 we should all be used to deceptive political advertising that twists facts and smears opponents but why would a man in mitch mcconnells position think he has to resort to such tactics
1500598 lunsford who held no elected position at the time was hardly the major force in this move
1500599 had such a change not been adopted our roads would be in ruin for lack of maintenance
1500600 mitch mcconnell has been good for kentucky in many ways
1500601 he has so many strengths he could be talking about its just silly to fixate on one of his opponents weaknesses especially one so groundless
1500602 at most prices are 12 1 cents per gallon higher as a result of the 1980 tax change that was favored by democratic candidate bruce lunsford
1500603 lunsford could have said all this in his ad striking back against mcconnells attacks
1500604 he didnt instead he chose to zero in on the amount of campaign money his opponent has taken from the oil and gas industry
1500605 its true that a party committee chairmans success is judged in large part by how much money is contributed to the committee under his leadership though he personally doesnt solicit every contribution
1500606 that chairman might or might not be as grateful for a donation to the committee as for a donation to his own campaign reelection fund
1500607 if six cents makes a huge difference then lunsford is finally admitting his automatic gas tax increases are hurting kentucky families
1500608 we are still developing what help we will get nationally and how that will come to bear

1500629 google is very good at many types of search but in many instances it produces nothing but spam and useless crap
1500630 the web contains an enormous amount of information and google has helped to make that information more easily accessible by providing pretty good search facilities
1500631 but not everything is written nor is everything well organized to make it easily discoverable there are millions of people who possess useful knowledge that they would love to share and there are billions of people who can benefit from it we believe that many do not share that knowledge today simply because it is not easy enough to do that the challenge posed to us by larry sergey and eric was to find a way to help people share their knowledge this is our main goal
1500632 the key idea behind the knol project is to highlight authors books have authors names right on the cover news articles have bylines scientific articles always have authors but somehow the web evolved without a strong standard to keep authors names highlighted we believe that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content
1500633 the goal is for knols to cover all topics from scientific concepts to medical information from geographical and historical to entertainment from product information to how to fix it instructions google will not serve as an editor in any way and will not bless any content all editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors we hope that knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line anyone will be free to write for many topics there will likely be competing knols on the same subject competition of ideas is a good thing
1500634 knols include strong community tools which allow for many modes of interaction between readers and authors people can submit comments rate or write a review of a knol at the discretion of the author a knol may include ads from our adsense program if an author chooses to include ads google will provide the author with a revenue share from the proceeds of those ad placements

1500908 happy thoughts the question has been asked indeed i have asked this question of why happy moments can be so often forgotten while sad or terrible times become entrenched in the mind why is there the tendency to play with problem or fixate on something negative i do not know it has occurred to me with realized clarity that we are afraid of happiness and push it away from us the courageous decision becomes to open up to more possibilities of greater pleasure when feeling unhappy it might be useful to remind yourself of a few alternative thoughts changing a few thoughts can often be the fastest way to feeling okay and not so lost even though im unhappy my life has meaning there is value in what i am feeling its okay to feel what i am feeling we all have happy and unhappy moods feelings do not last forever the world is safe i dont have to be happy every moment this too shall pass i can choose to pamper myself while i am in this unhappy place happy actions what actions can i take to pamper myself while i am feeling unhappy today i woke up not feeling particularly happy actually this feeling has been with me for a few days now what an opportunity to focus more intently on my own life and the experiences that would feel joyful no need to fight the unhappy just an opportunity to be tender to myself an opportunity to say yes to more pleasure refrain from playing the martyr and stop being a pleasure delayer heres what ive done so far today and my plan instead of immediately starting work took a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood this morning accepted that an unhappy feeling was journeying with me for a short while this feeling is worthy of my acceptance and my love i am worthy of loving myself even when im not in my typical feeling state supported myself with a healthy colorful and nourishing breakfast and lunch added some protein for better balance and groundedness wrote in my journal about my current experience which helped me get a more balanced perspective im not completely unhappy my life isnt all or nothing wrote a detailed gratitude list played with my cats decided to write this article because even though it seemed demanding in the short term it would bring me pleasure in the long term will reward my efforts for completing this task by getting a 20 minute chair massage shortly will sit outside in the trees and by the creek behind my house have asked myself the question what specifically do i want to do tonight that will be different and fun
1500909 the unhappiness that u may experience is a normal state in your life however the choice of being happy and unhappy is really up to u everyone have an option being happy while unhappy and vice versa
1500910 for one thing he wont be making much noise hes not exactly garrulous and hell stand out as a loner
1500911 the first thing youll notice about the typical virgo is the definite impression he gives that theres a serious prob lem on his mind hes struggling to solve or a vague feeling that hes secretly worried about something
1500912 the virgo is normally a small person certainly no giant but hes muscular and he has far more strength than his fragile appearance suggests
1500913 he also has very precise ideas about health little patience with laziness and very few illusions about life and people even when hes in love
1500914 although they dream very few impossible dreams vir gos often have the inconsistent trait of looking like lovely dreamers as if they were all wrapped up in the very rain bows their logical minds refuse to believe in or follow
1500915 when theyre annoyed by vulgarity stupidity or careless ness virgos can suddenly become cranky irritable scold ing and nervous but most of the time theyre gentle folk and quite nice to have around especially around the sick room
1500916 a virgo may criticize your statements with hairsplitting arguments which drive you wild but if you are in a jam hell also quickly step in to turn things right side up again with no motive except to serve if the job you tackled has you so bogged down in boring details you despair of meeting the deadline virgo will roll up his sleeves and pitch in willingly its not ego that makes him itch to take over when things are in a shambles its just that his orderly mercurial mind cant stand procrastination neg lected details or confusion of purpose he may even straighten things out before hes asked with no intention of rudeness because bringing order out of chaos is in stinctive with him
1500917 you should be able to pick out a virgo in a roomful of people with no trouble hes incapable of sitting still for very long after a while hell become visibly restless and pace the floor or change chairs like a jumping jack and project a vague sense of urgency as if hes late for another appointment somewhere
1500918 its hard to understand why virginians are sometimes called selfish since they usually find more satisfaction in serving others than in satisfying their own personal ambi tion
1500919 he wants a decent honest and genuine relationship he knows very well how small his chances are of finding it but its useless to expect him to accept anything less if circumstances ever do involve him in a sordid affair you can be certain he wont remain in its clutches for long
1500920 if your heart is set on a virgo man youd better brush up your thinking cap and wear it when hes around virgos hate ignorance stupidity and sloppy thinking almost as much as they hate dirt and vulgarity and thats a lot the girl who snares the virgo heart had better be smartly dressed with a sizable brain under her neat hair style and youll notice i said neat hair style virgos look for women who are clean in body and mind and who dress well but not in flashy extremes of fashion
1500921 a virgo man is invariably kindly and thoughtful about all those little things which matter to women he has a crystal clear memory and probably wont forget special dates though he may be a bit mystified as to why you think they are so important he wont be wildly passionately jealous yet virgo males are possessive in the extreme this sounds like a fine line to draw but its important even though he doesnt throw emotional scenes of jealousy over the attentions other men pay you his deeply rooted pos sessiveness should warn you that a little freedom goes a long way the wife of a virgo who wanders too far away from the home fires too often may find herself without a husband to return to virgos are utterly loyal and they dislike destroying family ties intensely but when their sense of decency has been finally outraged they wont hesi tate to make a cold clean break in the divorce court no messy complicated trial separations for them when its over its over goodbye and good luck even the virgos sharp unusually excellent memory wont cause him to cry sentimental tears over the past simply because hes able to discipline his memory as firmly as he does his emotions self discipline is part of his very nature the virgo man with his mind made up moves on and having moved on all your tears and apologies are useless in getting him to change his mind hell never fall victim to the illusion that gluing together the broken pieces will recreate perfection in what has once been seriously flawed
1500922 hell be reliable and pleasant if youre tactful about his faults he wont have many of them anyway unless you call the way he runs his finger across the furniture every night looking for dust a fault little habits like that no matter what he does try not to nag him remember hes not constituted to be able to take the critical analysis he applies to others get used to his habit of criticizing you and laugh it off with the realization that he cant help being such a sensitive hairsplitter once that resentment is out of the way you can relax and really enjoy your bright loyal virgo hes not an angel there are no wings sprouting on his shoulders but lots of wives will be jealous of you

1501031 attraverso un esame delle tracce di sangue sul pavimento sugli stipiti e sulle pareti
1501032 laltezza dal pavimento del corpo di chiara non ha superato i 70 centimetri
1501033 non si ricollegano a nessuna delle scarpe di alberto stasi
1501034 qualora per ipotesi avesse calpestato qualche macchia di sangue sul pavimento si pu dimostrare che il materiale di queste scarpe non consente di assorbire quello che si sta calpestando
1501035 le fotografie scattate nellimmediatezza del ritrovamento consentono di poter affermare che alberto stasi poteva attraversare tutto il soggiorno senza calpestare alcuna traccia ematica
1501036 nessuna impronta estranea a quelle dei componenti della famiglia poggi o dello stesso alberto stasi mai stata trovata in casa
1501037 lidea che addirittura altre due persone siano entrate in casa senza lasciare impronte senza macchiarsi con il sangue a terra al momento mi lascia perplesso
1501038 alcuna preclusione nei confronti di alcuna ipotesi se basata su elementi di scientificit

1501043 we want to apologize to our loyal customers and express our appreciation for their patience by giving all current subscribers an automatic 30 day extension to their mobileme subscription free of charge
1501044 we have recently completed the transition from mac to mobileme unfortunately it was a lot rockier than we had hoped
1501045 another snag we have run into is our use of the word
1501046 i just spent the better part of an hour going through apples phone support maze only to be told that we are basically all hosed for at least a week if you are a mac user and are trying to publish iweb content via this mobileme ss you can forget about it for now it doesnt work period there are huge bugs and apple is well aware of them
1501047 we understand this is a serious issue and apologize for this service interruption we are working hard to restore your service
1501048 thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme mail problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
1501049 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1501050 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1501054 meaning iran suspending its uranium enriching activities while talks continue against the security council refraining implementing the sanctions already approved and deciding on new ones
1501055 the letter of mr said jalili the secretary of irans supreme council on national security scns and the regimes senior nuclear negotiator to mr solana his principal counterpart for the talks comprises a short review of the latest meeting between the two men
1501056 the letter does not address the groups main demand namely the suspension of uranium enriching activities
1501057 no more than a transcript of a telephone conversation between solana and irans top nuclear negotiators on monday
1501058 no more than a transcript of a telephone conversation between solana and irans top nuclear negotiator jalili who met in geneva
1501059 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1501060 the basis to the foreign policy of the ruling ayatollahs is essentially based on the old persian saying of there is always some hope from one column to another
1501061 the problem with mr mahmoud ahmadinejad is that not only he himself do not understand anything about modern economy but because of his firm belief that mahdi the muslim shias twelfth imam would soon reappear and arrange everything to the liking of the iranians he has no confidence in economic experts and listen to no one except yes men
1501062 at the same time with a yes and no policy the ruling ayatollahs also hope that the six or at least four of them meaning minus russia and china would get serious in implementing the sanctions thus providing iranian officials the tools to portray the islamic republic as a victim of the imperialists and justify more sacrifices from the iranian people including accepting more repressions more censorship of the press and expressions more restrictions on the already badly limited social and cultural freedoms
1501063 this is a very good case of iranian ambivalence the regime rejects the present world order wants to change it starting by the united nations a body it regards as an object at the hands of the united nations and the five permanent members of the security council while at the same time not only it continue its membership of the organisation but also wants to enter the security council
1501064 if china and russia have signed the three resolutions against iran is that they consider themselves as part of this international order and do not want to change it
1501065 syria of president bashar assad which contrary to his iranian counterpart does not seek the annihilation of israel would certainly leave the camp of the regions radicals led by iran and join the west if and when it can trust washington and tel aviv the day damascus recovers the golan heights it would establish full relations with israel
1501066 bashar is preparing himself for this historic moment a move that would certainly change the face of the middle east this is what very probably assad informed the iranians during his last visit to tehran last week and very probably he also told iranians that it is time for them to change to the regions new realities

1501113 con la nostra iniziativa prosegue aldo di biagio le parti sociali recuperano la centralit del loro ruolo abbiamo infatti impegnato il governo ad introdurre nella disposizione transitoria una opportuna modifica che riporta alla possibilit per le aziende interessate dal provvedimento e le organizzazioni sindacali di sottoscrivere degli accordi migliorativi e pi vantaggiosi sia per i lavoratori che per le stesse imprese una soluzione logica alla quale peraltro recentemente approdata anche poste italiane il cui amministratore delegato l11 luglio scorso ha sottoscritto con le organizzazioni sindacali un protocollo di intesa per la stabilizzazione di circa 14mila precari precedentemente assunti con contratto a tempo determinato

1501168 if there is something theyve requested weve responded to every request the best that we can
1501169 we have done everything we have been able to do
1501170 we have gotten the correct people out there we have given them free reign through the building to try and get this problem solved as fast as possible
1501171 im having to pay the old loan for the trade in as well the money we gave him to pay that pay off plus the money for the new car and i only have the one and i dont have the registration for it
1501172 just the sheer numbers of six dealerships in less than a year over 300 titles and trade ins for people that some still a year or more ago dont have a car theyve paid for or are still in a car they cant get information on they cant get a title

1501174 after evaluating and contacting all of the water systems in the upstate theres not an immediate crisis but theres not an immediate crisis because of the efforts that everyones been taking most everyone in the upstate water systems reported that they have seen at least a 10 percent in some cases as much as a 25 percent reduction
1501175 we have been in voluntary restrictions and our public in spartanburg county has been very responsive its brought down our usage by about 10 to 15 percent its been a big help but we do still have a concern with the drought on our north and south pacolet streams were at historic low levels so were going to continue to watch it over the next three to four weeks and see if we need to make a change
1501176 mr president in talking about the recession tonight you have blamed the mistakes of the past and you have blamed congress does any of the blame fall on you
1501177 the engineer decided not to get out of his car anymore hoping that the police would somehow disperse the bottleneck the heat of august combined with a passage of time marked by tires so that the immobility was ever more exasperating everything was the smell of gasoline rowdy yells from the youths in the simca the glare of the sun reflecting off glass and chrome and to top it off the contradictory sensation of being trapped in the heart of a jungle of machines designed for speed
1501178 that means the traffic jams start at 3 a m and keep going
1501179 its no longer a question of more cars but rather increased use of the car for longer commutes and for leisure
1501180 many of the difficult stretches correspond to places where there are great wines
1501181 you start the day with the traffic jams in burgundy and then move south through the wines of the rhone valley
1501182 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk
1501183 our goal is to reduce our operating losses to 13m in fiscal year 2009 7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011
1501184 we believe the long term growth potential in the uk is much greater th an in canada
1501185 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1501186 its a stable chemical it does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
1501187 could potentially keep a lot of graduate students busy for a very long time
1501188 frankly has not been through as much review and validation as theyd like
1501189 our first priority is try to secure what we were promised in regard to a permanent training facility at sydney showground
1501190 for whatever reason that hasnt eventuated and we cant see that improving theres certainly no assurances it will improve
1501191 if we cant come to some sort of arrangement where weve got a permanent training base for next season well have to take a closer look at the options available to us
1501192 whether that includes gosford belmore or the crest at bass hill remains to be seen
1501193 i think all sydney based clubs need to look at the merits of relocating to gosford
1501194 club ceos would not be doing their jobs properly if they did not look at the fors and againsts of such a move
1501195 we are having some difficulties with our relationship with sopa and some significant frustrations with the facilities those frustrations are shared by the playing and coaching group
1501196 look at what the club has been through the salary cap scandal coffs harbour and now sonny bill williams walking out theres a lot of baggage
1501197 of course the future careers of the three players was discussed it was canvassed
1501198 im not going to sit here and talk rubbish to you of course it was discussed
1501199 at the end of our playing campaign the three boys careers will be assessed again
1501200 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the season but were not sitting down as a club right at the moment going who are we going to trade we dont do that until the end of the year
1501201 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own team mates in the eye and actually lying to them that really destroys the essence of the club
1501202 it was decided by the leadership group and the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper
1501203 we feel that the integrity of this football club and that the policies of honesty and integrity that we build the whole organisation on if thats robbed or taken away or diminished in any way shape or form then youre striking at the very essence or core of your existence you might as well turn the lights off and go home
1501204 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club and asking questions
1501205 if an agent who was accredited by us encouraged and promoted a player to breach his contract and go overseas in similar circumstances to sonny bill wed probably go close to disbarring him and revoking his licence
1501206 it would be in breach of our code of conduct which requires all players to adhere to their side of the contract
1501207 we also had a university of nsw contract law expert deborah healey in who said facilitating a player breaching their contract that they too could be liable
1501208 the only way it could happen is if a private club owner over there thumbed his nose at the irb and the ffr
1501209 it would align us with the northern hemisphere wouldnt it

1501228 und es ist ein sehr sehr gro er segen das zu haben was ich habe
1501229 ich bin eine s ngerin ich w rde mich nicht blo mit einem musik genre einlassen ich singe gerne r amp b pop soul und blues bei mir dreht sich nicht alles blo um jazz und fertig
1501230 eigentlich bin ich mehr soul und r amp b s ngerin als jazz s ngerin die leute sehen mich als jazz s ngerin weil ich als solche der musikwelt vorgestellt wurde
1501231 ich war auf der suche nach einer reihe von jazz sachen und habe mich wirklich in die songs aus dieser zeit und in diese art von musik verliebt
1501232 eigentlich alles ich h re mir sogar country musik an
1501233 wahrscheinlich war ich ein bisschen naiv damals weil ich wusste dass es eine gro e sache war und ich trotzdem nicht nerv s wurde ich werde jetzt noch immer nicht nerv s aber das war der anfang davon
1501234 weil ich beim ersten mal nicht nerv s war wusste ich dass ich es auch nicht bei irgendeiner anderen show sein muss deshalb habe ich die nervosit t einfach sein lassen
1501235 als ich im vergangenen jahr am parliament hill in ottawa die nationalhymne singen durfte gab es einen richtigen massenandrang ich war schon sehr stolz darauf weil ich eine junge kanadierin bin und alle unter mir waren und ich oben auf der b hne sie sahen zu mir auf und sangen mit die hand auf dem herzen das war eine wirklich lustige erfahrung
1501236 ich habe so viel gl ck das zu haben was ich habe

1501238 ich mache das aus liebe zur musik nicht f r den ruhm und nicht f r reichtum sondern ganz einfach weil ich das liebe was ich tue und ich m chte das auch weiterhin tun
1501239 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1501240 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1501241 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1501242 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1501243 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1501244 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1501245 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
1501246 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
1501247 during each economic slowdown cisco has always navigated through them very effectively gained wallet share and in my opinion market share

1501262 there is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the framers intended to build the wall of separation between church and state it is a metaphor based on bad history a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging it should be frankly and explicitly abandoned

1501267 the uncertainty of santa anitas track surface situation bothers us
1501268 we considered the pacific classic and also the arlington million 1 miles on turf at arlington park on aug 9
1501269 but the horse is at saratoga where he loves it even though those other races have purses twice as big as the woodward we decided to leave him where hes happy and not ship him out of town
1501270 we still think he can be a champion on turf just like hes been a champion on dirt
1501271 but we dont think theres enough time to get him ready for the arc
1501272 fifty one percent suggested he run on turf 33 percent on dirt 10 percent on a synthetic surface and 6 percent said we should retire him
1501273 we think its going to be a fair and consistent surface and the horsemen will like it

1501277 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1501278 thats what happens when redevelopment is forced down our throats
1501279 that team i wasnt familiar with any of them until today
1501280 but theyve got some players over there that are some pretty damn good players
1501281 we knew they were going to go out there and be physical and play hard not do anything dirty
1501282 i mean you had a little altercation out there but you understand that both teams are just out there playing basketball and just trying to win and compete
1501283 i think it was clear to me that they were an extremely well coached team they executed extremely well i mean theyre great
1501284 this is the best team weve faced so far in terms of their execution and how hard they played and it was a fun game to be a part of
1501285 this is an important piece in the puzzle as we strive to determine if a habitable environment exists on mars
1501286 it is neither good nor bad for life it does not preclude life on mars in fact its a potential energy source
1501287 some kinds of earth life would be happy to live in these soils
1501288 perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources
1501289 we must be sure we have not introduced the material
1501290 i must say it seems rather remote since our fuel is hydrazine and contains no chlorine it could have migrated in the spacecraft before leaving earth but thats a low possibility
1501291 during the oven analysis they didnt look for chlorine since they were not expecting it
1501292 we dont want to come to the media and say we found chocolate on mars and then two weeks later say we were wrong its strawberry
1501293 before congress spends billions to build public schools that meet
1501294 eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major u s retailers and the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers have been charged with numerous crimes including conspiracy computer intrusion fraud and identity theft attorney general michael b mukasey u s attorney for the district of massachusetts michael j sullivan u s attorney for the southern district of california karen p hewitt u s attorney for the eastern district of new york benton j campbell and u s secret service director mark sullivan announced today the scheme is believed to constitute the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the department of justice
1501295 u s senator dick durbin d il announced that a number of the largest american internet companies microsoft google yahoo human rights organizations and other stakeholders have reached agreement on a voluntary code of conduct that would govern internet companies operating in countries where internet freedom is restricted like china
1501296 i would prefer the liberal party to run in neither by election but to get behind the nationals candidates as coalition candidates to send the necessary messages to both the federal and state labor governments
1501297 theyd want to hurry up because most of the horses are already lined up in the race
1501298 chicago tonight aired a great raucous discussion of the constitutionality of traffic cameras a week or so ago heres the link
1501299 his voice was clear even though marco starts feeling pain at his lower limbs
1501300 marco has reached the main base camp he is recovering the base camp has facilities to provide him with immediate medical help like oxygen and drugs so he will improve gradually
1501301 everything was going well to camp 4 and then on the summit attempt everything went wrong
1501302 we had to move them that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1501303 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i also had to survive
1501304 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1501305 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1501306 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1501307 it has been a dramatic bull story along with the commodity boom
1501308 the aussies fall is more a function of the rba than the us fed today
1501309 although downside risk to growth remains the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1501310 we dont expect any changes from them until 2009 once the housing market has stabilised
1501311 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1501312 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done it is the kind of information the private investigators are going to follow up
1501313 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1501314 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say i told her i thought she was cute and asked if she wanted a balloon she didnt i thought it a odd then i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddy but a longer name she could have said madeleine but i dont remember that
1501315 i think this is an issue for the premier and a warning shot across everyones bows to re examine as life becomes more challenging as information gets to us quicker whether those who are charged with high office actually have enough time not only to do their job but to think about what they are doing
1501316 but a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever
1501317 the greatest danger to american freedom is a government that ignores the constitution
1501318 i want some beef jerky im thirsty i want some powdered donuts i want chicken fingers
1501319 isnt derek anderson going to start for cleveland its just my guess its why i read the defensive scouting report
1501320 there are a lot of factors that go into naming a starter so ill get together postpractice and watch the tape
1501321 ill spend some time with mike tannenbaum and with the staff see what their input is and then make a decision after that
1501322 well see who goes out there and who goes out there second
1501323 that will be all up to coach but it comes down to moving the team managing the game taking care of the football obviously and then scoring points
1501324 im not worried about it im really not im excited to play and get back out under the lights and try to build on the progress that ive made so far
1501325 i feel very good about where i am as a quarterback right now and the progress ive made and i feel like ive taken some steps to really become better and help us win
1501326 we have been competing for quite some time now and its a body of work it started way back in the spring and i think its going to be an overall evaluation
1501327 i dont know how games are weighted but they evaluate everything we do
1501328 i know the coaches do a lot of evaluation from practice but theyll do a lot more probably from this game
1501329 as far as how much weight goes into it who knows youd have to ask the guy whos making the decision but its important to all of us to go out there and have a good showing
1501330 what you have thats nice is you have the ability to see the offense function function with the playclock function with the gameclock and function with the situations that arent scripted
1501331 based on my past experiences its been the night before the game when we have our quarterback meetings
1501332 lo que incorporar un descuento que anunciar fenosa sobre las facturas en mora y todo dentro del ordenamiento que tendr el mercado oriental
1501333 y lo que se va a tener que pagar ahora
1501334 we finally have the personnel to implement a game plan of high percentage incomplete passes completed passes of four yards or less and a rushing attack that lets us lose control of the game clock with complex plays that take forever to develop and generate negative yardage
1501335 im confident that both rex grossman and kyle orton possess the ability to overthrow a receiver on a deep fly pattern or find an open defender and deliver the ball with laser like precision so well be switching between them often and at random intervals to avoid either one getting into a rhythm or developing any confidence

1501342 even small children tell me xinjiang belongs to the uighurs so i should go back to china
1501343 the treasurers statements have an enormous influence across the economy
1501344 remember the day before the reserve bank met at the beginning of this year it was wayne swan who said the inflation genie is out of the bottle
1501345 now i thought that was just an extravagant mistake but he repeated it and repeated it and the prime minister went around the country saying the inflation monster was out of control
1501346 i am not going to talk about a recession wayne swan if he was consistent with his previous conduct no doubt would be trying to talk up a recession
1501347 ive been talking about the economys strengths all year wayne swans only just started to mention them
1501348 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time
1501349 remember the day before the reserve bank met at the beginning of this year it was wayne swan who said the inflation genie is out of the bottle
1501350 but a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever
1501351 the greatest danger to american freedom is a government that ignores the constitution
1501352 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1501353 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1501354 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1501355 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1501356 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1501357 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1501358 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab
1501359 but a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever
1501360 the greatest danger to american freedom is a government that ignores the constitution

1501373 on the other hand im a democratic lobbyist and while ive certainly survived periods of republican control its good for me to have democrats in control of congress its good for me to have a democrat in the white house so again its personal but you cant say that its not professional
1501374 talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
1501375 mccains absent leadership on energy independence doesnt match his rhetoric
1501376 this is yet another worrying set of statistics confirming that the financial crisis continues to deepen
1501377 particularly concerning is the construction sector which usually shows a strong requirement for temporary labour
1501378 this is a clear indication that the credit crunch has started to reach the jobs market
1501379 business confidence is low and as a result employers are becoming much more cautious

1501387 my interest in the hamburger inn is that my mother the late helen maxine smith lehman worked there in 1946 and 1947
1501388 as youngsters many many years ago we heard about her working there and how good the food was and especially how inexpensive it was 25 cents for a large burger i believe

1501411 we are trying to find responsible companies that are leaders in making social progress
1501412 after they go through all the financial data conventional portfolio managers must make judgment calls about whether to buy a stock
1501413 the same is true of social research analysts in the end we must make judgments about which companies are doing the most to protect the environment or improve corporate governance
1501414 it is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower
1501415 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1501416 mr solana will discuss it with representatives of the five plus one
1501417 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1501418 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1501419 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1501420 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1501421 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1501422 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1501423 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1501424 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1501425 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1501426 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1501427 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1501428 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with haart antiretroviral therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections
1501429 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment

1501431 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1501432 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1501433 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1501434 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy

1501930 an ailing rotation and banged up bullpen brings dan giese back to a starting role for the new york yankees
1501931 major league baseball investigators are looking into accusations that several new york yankees prospects from the dominican republic were forced to kick back portions of their signing bonuses to one or more team employees several sources told espn the revelation is one of several developments in an ongoing investigation of a financial scandal involving the signing of players from the dominican republic
1501932 yankees brought in an estimated 327 million to lead all major league baseball teams not bad considering that in 1973 george steinbrenner bought the entire team for 10 million but if you think those revenue numbers are big you aint seen nothing yet when the new stadium opens next year revenues are poised to double
1501933 help is on the way to make them even better while the red sox jason bay added the manny melodrama subtracted and yankees xavier nady damaso marte and ivan rodriguez added believe they made themselves better in the days leading up to the trade deadline the rays have done nothing until now very soon probably within the next week or two they will add an impact pitcher and yet another athletic outfielder the cost nothing david price and rocco baldelli are the kind of reinforcements who can influence a pennant race

1501937 shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians who defend the abortion regime of roe v wade
1501938 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply say no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
1501939 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us what candidate or political party can withstand the loss of millions of catholic voters in this election or the next
1501940 catholic voters have the power to transform our politics and if faithful citizens can build a new politics a politics that is not satisfied with the status quo but one that is dedicated to building up a new culture of life there are more than 150 million catholics in north america and if we stand together and demand better from our politicians we can transform politics and if we truly hope for a culture of life and a civilization of love then we must first think and then act in new ways

1501950 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1501951 this survey highlights that some sectors of the housing market are experiencing appreciable rates of price decline though the overall picture when balanced out suggests that there has only been a 4 reduction but the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1501952 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1501953 the survey shows that price changes vary widely across different parts of northern ireland and across the types of properties so people should be cautious about making over simplistic judgments for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1501954 there is no precedent in this region for what is happening in terms of a genuine housing cycle so we are on a journey through the unknown which itself is feeding the uncertainty however with a very quiet resale market i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the 200 000 level before the end of year with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely turn before prices do but it might be a while
1501955 there is no doubt that northern irelands housing market is facing a challenging time but at the same time the current situation provides government with an opportunity to accelerate the building of social and affordable homes thereby helping both developers by providing them with guaranteed cash flow and the many households waiting to access a social dwelling or purchase their first home

1501984 the commissioner made it very clear that dr hayne had done an excellent job
1501985 a close scrutiny of that which is being alleged has been proven to be totally false
1501986 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1501987 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1501988 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1502010 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1502011 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1502012 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions

1502017 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1502018 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1502019 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1502020 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1502021 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1502022 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1502023 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1502024 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1502025 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1502026 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1502027 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1502028 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1502029 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1502030 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1502031 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1502032 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1502033 teams could turn their pass protection toward me and terrell last year

1502035 years ago calling a player a tweener was a bad word
1502036 but we like the hybrid type the ones who might not be big enough or fast enough but have a passion to play we want guys who play like a raven
1502037 hes a rookie but gosh hes had a lot of carries his whole career
1502038 as a running back hes a veteran it will be new for him playing against an nfl defense particularly that the patriots defense and it will be interesting to see how hell do
1502039 but id be surprised if hes not up to the task
1502040 he came out here and worked hard and took a ton of reps hes got a good feel for the offense i think were pleased to where hes at right now
1502041 punt returns are a little hard but kickoff returns are natural i always wanted to do that at rutgers
1502042 im looking forward to his return to see how good a duo we could be
1502043 i think it will ease my mind and make me feel like one of the guys again
1502044 its just great to see his face the guys are kind of relieved and excited to have him back
1502045 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is friend of the united states and even israel our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace
1502046 the white house had concocted a fake letter from tahir jalil habbush al tikriti to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1502047 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1502048 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi women
1502049 could be the basis for potential charges against individuals or the state
1502050 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1502051 the challenges are greater and exceed irans ability to reply
1502052 if he wins mofaz is going to be elected based on rank and file voters of the kadima party not by oil speculators and those who hold oil stocks
1502053 mr mofaz is going to point at it all the time
1502054 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1502055 so first we will see what happens with the rest of the day that is left in europe and then they will have their call tomorrow we will see where we go from there
1502056 will evaluate that response and well have more to say about it tomorrow after the call

1502058 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1502059 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1502060 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1502061 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1502062 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1502063 political correctness is a doctrine fostered by a lets hope the us authorities can work instep with the canadians

1502071 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1502072 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1502073 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1502074 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1502075 it ended up working out better for both sides me coming here
1502076 mangini came in and thats what he was accustomed to
1502077 he had won super bowls in that defense so you cant fault him for wanting to go with that
1502078 i looked at what happened last year when they started off 0 4 and ended the season 7 9
1502079 you do that and it says a lot about the character of your team the character of the guys in the locker room that really appealed to me knowing that you got guys who care about their performance about winning and when those are the top priorities winning and performing well you can fix all the other things
1502080 youre getting a free education you might as well make the most of it
1502081 i could tell that the first time i talked to him
1502082 i feel fortunate for us to be in a position to bring in a guy like that and its not a huge risk
1502083 everybody knows the kind of production he had on the field in the past and everyones excited about that
1502084 it is something ive got to deal with it the rest of the season im going to have good days and bad days some days it feels right sometimes it didnt
1502085 anytime theres competition its a good time every day you come out here to compete and you cant have a bad day out here
1502086 when you watch him practice and watch him work we felt hed have a good game
1502087 he did everything that he was called on to do thats probably what hes been doing for eight or nine years
1502088 you have to go out there and do the right thing every time just like practice

1502091 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1502092 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1502093 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1502094 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1502095 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1502096 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1502097 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1502098 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1502099 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity
1502100 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1502101 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1502102 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1502103 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1502104 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1502105 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1502106 we all complain on our teams that i want to play with this player or that one well here weve got them all this is how its supposed to be we dont have any excuses
1502107 a big part of the early conversation for us was how disrespectful it appeared we had been
1502108 when you asked people around the world what do you think of usa basketball and the things that came out of their mouth were no humility and very arrogant and just dont respect anybody both on and off the court
1502109 well if youre an american and youre a basketball guy you want to change it
1502110 the younger guys didnt have to pretend to be something they couldnt yet as leaders
1502111 having the players in this kid of a circumstance now is so different because we can control the environment
1502112 players with respective franchises are in control here they know they have to do it our way the leverage is reversed to some degree in a positive way
1502113 guys were all hugging each other saying things like i wish i didnt have to go back i wish we could just stay together for me that was just an ultimate moment
1502114 i cant take it back i could have handled it better but i dont apologize for the full meaning behind it and the fire
1502115 were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1502116 non hustle being late disrespecting the game in terms of hot dog no hustling those types of things will get you suspended
1502117 because theres a lot of factors that go into that ill get together post practice watch the tape
1502118 i just want to go through the week finish up the practices finish up the meetings with the coaches with mike and then go from there
1502119 isnt derek going to start for cleveland thats just my guess thats why i read the defensive scouting report
1502120 i dont know whos starting who knows when theyll tell us
1502121 you guys are history buffs so based upon our past experiences with coach we have no clue whats going to happen and whos going to start were on a need to know basis and we dont need to know right now
1502122 i dont know it might be a nice changeup itll be coachs decision i didnt really think too much into it as far as who started the green white game saturday and well see what the decision is for cleveland
1502123 sometimes its one guy has a better day than the other and then it could flip flip in practice flip during the course of a day
1502124 well see who goes out there and who goes out there second
1502125 thatll be all up to coach it comes down to moving the team managing the game taking care of the football obviously and scoring points
1502126 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1502127 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1502128 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1502129 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1502130 it would be an amazing feat and i feel like im up to it but i hope in that process that we win a grey cup you know what i mean
1502131 the stats are going to come because the offence is that good
1502132 we keep putting points on the board and moving the ball well get the stats but weve got to get the wins
1502133 surprised no i watched him on tape and i thought he had the skills necessary to be really effective in doing what were trying to do
1502134 weve started out good but weve got a long way to go
1502135 the picture wont be painted until its all done we play good teams with good co ordinators and well just see how things go
1502136 i thought id get the opportunity in detroit because they didnt really have a guy
1502137 i was a rookie free agent i didnt know anything about it
1502138 i thought the best guy would play and i was the best guy but they wanted a veteran in there i didnt get my chance i guess it just wasnt my time but im not worried about what happened in the past right now im taking the opportunity im given
1502139 when they moved me to linebacker that hurt my pride a lot
1502140 you play offence you got pride im the leading rusher in my schools history and they want me to play linebacker but i humbled myself and looked at it as another door opening for me it made me say they really want to keep me around i waited my time out and ended up the season as the running back started one game and then when payton got hurt in the playoff game i finished that game
1502141 we believe this rule change is necessary to reinforce the importance of accuracy at the highest levels of the game
1502142 i feel like its more challenging for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of the rough or out of the rough is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out i like that challenge
1502143 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget to keep it going
1502144 they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because there are enough engineers and r amp d research and development and technology that keep us from getting longer
1502145 if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway and hit a more crisp and a better golf shot its probably a good avenue i think its a positive move
1502146 this is another one of the guys who is a big piece of what were building here its going to be great to see him get the experience and get it started right here
1502147 to tell you the truth it was i just couldnt believe it if i havent been playing very well this scenario wouldnt have never happened
1502148 ive been able to win 12 times out here but ive never been able to get it done in a major i never even really played well until 96 when i lost in the playoff to
1502149 puttings always held me back for the past three months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period if i putt somewhere near like i putted this summer ive got a great shot this week
1502150 set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september this will be a great place to do it
1502151 it just taught me i need to set more goals in my life my only goal was to make the ryder cup team thats all i focused in on this year
1502152 i believe as an individual you need to decide what allows you to play your best golf
1502153 and you need to go that direction regardless of the scrutiny
1502154 i need to try and find a bit more consistency for me to really feel like i can compete when the gun goes off
1502155 my game is kind of coming and going right now
1502156 ive been working on trying to get it a bit more consistent but last week was like a typical week for me at this point two really good rounds i thought i had something going and then kind of a so so round on sunday
1502157 i felt like i was gaining on something but then came out on sunday and sort of fell away a little bit again
1502158 thats been disappointing i would love to get to a point where the feelings dont come and go so much
1502159 being a left handed person playing right handed i have some tendencies that tend to work against me in my golf swing when im not playing well
1502160 at that point i start fighting those tendencies its just something that i have to deal with and its about inconsistency i dont think im going to try and read anything into it
1502161 im just going to go work harder at it and try and find something that sticks well see how it goes hopefully it comes together come thursday
1502162 we are elated to have our stadium expected to be the finest building in american soccer opening several weeks early as our surging first place team makes its 2008 playoff run
1502163 concert goers fans of youth sports and entertainment consumers of all types will have an opportunity to experience this world class venue now opening on october 9
1502164 you just dont walk out there and be in midseason form
1502165 i dont think i was very sharp by any means but i would have gotten some outs today
1502166 i need to mechanically get a lot better but my arm feels good and my finger feels great i didnt have a second thought about it
1502167 if i feel good i think the results will be there
1502168 theres very few times you feel great and you dont do well
1502169 the positive was the last slider i threw was the best one i threw
1502170 theres times you go out there and you just dont have it right away and you just find a way to get outs until you get comfortable
1502171 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1502172 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1502173 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1502174 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs
1502175 as a friend i wish him well i hope his recovery is good i hope hes feeling strong we need him out here he obviously is the best player in the world he builds a lot of excitement around events
1502176 but whether hes here or not i have a job to do and i dont really worry about the impact need something to write about anyway so it gives you something to talk about

1502181 when adversity knocks on your door how do you respond
1502182 this horse is not a horse to me he is a person and how can you sell a person a friend
1502183 you foolish old man we knew that someday the horse would be stolen it would have been better to sell it what a misfortune
1502184 dont go so far as to say that simply say that the horse is not in the stable this is the fact everything else is a judgment whether it is a misfortune or a blessing i dont know because this is just a fragment who knows what is going to follow it
1502185 old man you were right this was not a misfortune it has indeed proved to be a blessing
1502186 again you are going too far just say that the horse is back who knows whether it is a blessing or not it is only a fragment you read a single word in a sentence how can you judge the whole book
1502187 again you proved right it was a misfortune your only son has lost the use of his legs and in your old age he was your only support now you are poorer than ever
1502188 you are obsessed with judgment dont go that far say only that my son has broken his legs nobody knows whether this is a misfortune or a blessing life comes in fragments and more is never given to you
1502189 you were right old man this has proved a blessing maybe your son is crippled but he is still with you our sons are gone forever
1502190 you go on and on judging nobody knows only say this that your sons have been forced to enter into the army and my son has not been forced but only god the total knows whether it is a blessing or a misfortune
1502191 everything is mind over matter every disease is mental first everything is about thought everything is about vibration everything is about the way you feel practice scenarios that feel good and never mind reality reality is only a brief moment in time that you keep repeating
1502192 sir are you in the military well you just seem like military personnel

1502196 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1502197 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1502198 the governments press release does not state that the company knowingly hired underage workers
1502199 the company asks the public to keep an open mind and wait for the evidence before making any judgments about these or any other allegations
1502200 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1502201 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1502202 to the media this looks like a for profit company on one side and on the other side individuals who are hurting and suffering
1502203 but the company is also hurting and suffering we are not able to keep up production levels and reach out to our customers
1502204 did you see rabbis abusing anyone with a meat hook

1502211 reporters did not actually need to visit blocked web sites to do their jobs
1502212 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1502213 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1502214 at this point i dont see any reason why someone should not buy things from agriprocessors
1502215 they run a very impressive operation theyre very dedicated to making sure that everything is being done in the most appropriate way possible
1502216 the governments press release does not state that the company knowingly hired underage workers
1502217 the company asks the public to keep an open mind and wait for the evidence before making any judgments about these or any other allegations
1502218 i was shocked when i walked into that plant because i was expecting a lot worse
1502219 to impugn the integrity of 25 people is out of line
1502220 if theyre going and being paid by rubashkin then that should be forthrightly disclosed not that if somebody asks them they should only acknowledge it then
1502221 its very important if rabbis are going that things look totally above board and that its 100 percent clear that the desire is to do the right thing and not just the expedient thing if somebodys being paid youre beholden to them halacha is very clear about this
1502222 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1502223 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1502224 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing why we could save all the oil they are talking about getting off drilling if everybody were just inflating their tires an an an and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much

1502236 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1502237 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1502238 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal

1502240 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1502241 mr vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire by telling some people who went to plead with him why should i bother about jammu does jammu matter does jammu exist he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1502242 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1502243 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1502244 it was his way of registering his protest against mr omar abdullahs speech in parliament h e was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

1502262 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here
1502263 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1502264 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough it is about how you physically develop and i think with jack even at 16 it doesnt mean he wont be as physically strong as someone at 18 or even someone at 20
1502265 that has been the benefit of our reserve team the experienced players that our lads are up against means they learn on the pitch the senior players then show them what to do while the game is going on that is carried on for the young lads who learned so much in austria

1502284 the problematic aspect of the structure from the beginning has been the privatization of gain if the company is making profit it goes to the shareholders and the socialization of loss if the company is not able to meet its obligations than the government meets the obligation and whenever you have the privatization of gain and the socialization of loss you are going to have something that is very popular with the people who benefit from it but very problematic from the point of view of the broader society

1502419 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1502420 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1502421 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1502422 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1502423 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1502424 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets

1502438 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1502439 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1502440 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1502441 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1502442 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1502443 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1502444 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written

1502471 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book

1502473 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1502474 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1502475 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1502476 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1502477 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1502478 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1502479 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1502480 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1502481 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1502482 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1502483 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1502484 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1502485 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1502486 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1502487 they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1502488 the most current information derived from controlled environmental testing is that on fuel injected vehicles fuel mileage may decrease by approximately 2 percent

1502492 several times during his 12 years as a professor in the law school obama was invited to join the faculty in a full time tenure track position but he declined
1502493 the only way to win in iraq is to win it

1502636 en chivas estamos acostumbrados a trabajar bajo la presi n como la que se vive en estos momentos normalmente no se pierden dos partidos seguidos y aunque ste ltimo fue un amistoso contra barcelona parece que ha repercutido m s de lo que yo esperar a
1502637 hoy m s que nunca debo de tener m s calma que cualquier otra persona lo nico que me corresponde es trabajar fuerte para ganarle a monterrey a nadie le gusta perder y menos ante el barcelona pero a ese partido le doy su justa dimensi n
1502638 en chivas es as en un fin de semana se dieron dos resultados adversos y parece que lleg un hurac n as que por m s que pida paciencia por los elementos j venes los resultados tienen que darse a la orden estamos conscientes de ello y comprometidos con este proyecto por lo que debemos de sacarlo adelante

1502643 guadalajara trabaja un buen proyecto pero puede pagar la factura por la novatez de muchos de sus jugadores ellos trabajan as y quiz les falte algo de experiencia tienen jugadores como ram n morales h ctor reynoso jonny magall n y gonzalo pineda que son los que le dan equilibrio
1502644 la din mica que es la ventaja de chivas no les funcion para el segundo tiempo por lo que les ganamos bien y aplicamos un futbol m s inteligente
1502645 en dos a os si permanece este equipo va a estar complicado ganarles pero ahora todav a no tiene plantel para llegar a ser campeones no lo creo
1502646 tenemos un grupo de mayor experiencia que chivas guadalajara es un grupo m s joven que corre mucho pero solamente corriendo no se gana un partido hay que tener un poco de inteligencia la tuvimos y fuimos mejores con un hombre menos
1502647 yo no renunci eso quiero decir y que quede bien claro
1502648 en cuatro a os al frente de la selecci n paraguaya nunca tuve que dar explicaciones por las alineaciones ac ten a que dar cuenta todos los d as de la semana de la forma c mo bamos a jugar y eso es dif cil a veces
1502649 tengo la experiencia suficiente para saber que es un error es una desatenci n pens que iba a recibir de otra manera la jugada y cuando gir r os tuve que hacer la falta
1502650 no me queda m s que apoyar y estar cerca del equipo
1502651 no soy una persona de recibir muchas expulsiones hasta el 2005 cuando ten a seis a os en la primera divisi n no hab a sido expulsado
1502652 me toca vivirlo dos veces seguido en muy poco tiempo en m xico y me da pena por el equipo por el hecho de tener a un jugador menos en un momento en que sabemos que la posici n en el grupo es muy dif cil y donde hay equipos grandes y tenemos que ganar para clasificar a la liguilla

1502668 vamos por buen camino aunque al principio merec amos m s en el duelo contra atlante pero debemos demostrar que cada d a somos un buen equipo ante todos no nada m s ante un rival

1502671 el que se convoque a jugadores extranjeros que acaban de recibir la nacionalidad mexicana en lo personal m s que preocuparme me motiva a trabajar m s fuerte para que se fijen en m
1502672 en el caso de leandro augusto pues obviamente lo conozco es compa ero de equipo y te puedo decir que es una excelente persona buen compa ero al que todos apoyamos aqu y su llamado nos llen de gusto
1502673 eso es algo que deben analizar y en su caso hacer los dirigentes del futbol mexicano yo no soy qui n para decir si debe o no limitarse el llamado de nacionalizados a la selecci n
1502674 el que lleguen jugadores nacionalizados a la selecci n nacional no significa que se pierdan lugares al contrario esto implica una mayor competencia pues esto nos obligar a ser mejores para que podamos tener un lugar
1502675 pues en ese juego nuestra defensa y en especial nuestro portero sergio bernal se vieron muy bien
1502676 ha sido un camino largo pero sin lugar a duda he tenido una excelente preparaci n los ltimos cuatro meses han sido bastante buenos nos basamos en la parte f sica haciendo rutinas fuera del agua

1502679 todo depende de las competencias y de lo que se pueda hacer en r o no fue mi mejor momento no me encontraba bien f sicamente y eso me desconcentr pero de esas situaciones se aprende y aqu solo espero que empiece la competencia
1502680 si ya tenemos varios meses entrenando para este formato de las finales en la ma ana tendremos que levantarnos muy temprano pero ya no es problema esto es un nuevo formato que y lo hemos visto en varias competencias
1502681 vegans endeavor not to use or consume animal products of any kind
1502682 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1502683 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1502684 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1502685 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1502686 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1502687 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury

1502691 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1502692 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1502693 thats the mentality of west virginians in general they dont want anybody telling them what to do

1502695 you can work for yourself i do what i want i raise what i want i raise a good product i raise good stuff i dont want any junk i want everyone to get good produce
1502696 in other states farmers are getting bigger in west virginia as people move out of huntington or charleston theyre buying five to ten acres in rural area and ended up raising something small farms are increasing in west virginia contrary to other states around us
1502697 its interesting the produce you grow and can yourself the quality is a lot better
1502698 in west virginia gardens and families go together its a rich heritage very seldom do new people move in so you have the small families and heritage and good feeling about having garden and raising products you eat yourself not so much selling

1502707 if you are a victim of personal injury malpractice or corporate fraud you have almost no chance of having a jury verdict in your favor affirmed by the state mississippi supreme court
1502708 voters should be wary of supreme court candidates who insist that they have been especially fair to large corporations and insurance companies these are the justices who are now making it almost impossible for a victim to prevail in the supreme court even after a jury verdict is rendered in the victims favor

1502725 i saw the 300 mark coming and i freaked out
1502726 and i pulled my back out and it laid me up for four days i realized i had to do something not just for me but for my kids it was quite selfish of me to choose food and non movement over playing with my kids more importantly i was teaching my children terrible eating habits we were eating fast food two or three times a day i just made the decision we were not going to do that anymore

1502732 voy a trabajar mucho esta semana en lo t ctico para que el equipo se sienta c modo el domingo los que se adapten mejor para el partido los voy a poner
1502733 el va a parar todo el tiempo que sea necesario hasta que est al cien por ciento porque as como est no puede rendir ni aqu ni en selecci n
1502734 fue una jugada donde quedo enganchado con un jugador de cruz azul y cuando me quiero levantar l me cae encima y sent que la rodilla se fue para adentro intent correr en el costado del terreno de juego pero ya sent la rodilla muy floja y con dolor
1502735 del partido contra necaxa la verdad es que nos culpamos un poco los delanteros por todas las que fallamos tuvimos el partido en las manos y no lo pudimos definir
1502736 yo en especial tuve la ltima del partido cuando desbord peralta pero cuando me sirvi la pelota me lleg girando mucho no la pude bajar y el remate con la cabeza se me fue alto y fall
1502737 son cosas que nos pasan a los delanteros a veces las m s f ciles se nos van y cuando menos lo pensamos resolvemos de buena manera
1502738 en ponce el atleta enrique llanos arroj un resultado anal tico adverso a un esteroide anab lico conocido como estanozolol durante esa prueba se hizo el an lisis de la prueba a y casualmente ayer el lunes se comenz el an lisis de la prueba b se le inform al atleta y a la federaci n internacional de atletismo
1502739 por una comunicaci n de la iaf hay un resultado adverso tambi n en el torneo de atletismo celebrado en julio de este a o en cali colombia ser a un reincidente si se corrobora que es a la misma sustancia o a otra
1502740 es cierto eso ya se le inform a la federaci n de atletismo de puerto rico es una pena porque ya ha ocurido en dos ocasiones
1502741 hizo un ajuste en la clasificaci n de la carrera
1502742 se descalific al atleta y estamos en espera del resultado de la muestra b para imponer la sanci n correspondiente la raz n por la cual se le hizo un control antidopaje fue porque rompi la marca nacional lo que se hab a estipulado en las reglas del evento se le hicieron pruebas al ganador y a l
1502743 levanta la sanci n autom ticamente y se les restituye la tercera posici n
1502744 no hay duda que el esteroide anab lico tiene un efecto sobre las fibras del m sculo esquel tico que le aumenta su volumen y cantidad mejorando la potencia y fuerza
1502745 nos quedan 90 minutos por delante y todo puede pasar
1502746 it is a moving song about her life and last days in scarborough her soul is seen as carried up by the sea spray to be united with the souls of her family over the moors above haworth
1502747 i dont know if we can jump to that conclusion yet
1502748 we need to study this further we do know from two large scale clinical trials that smokers benefited more when they got plavix therapy maybe smoking does something to make plavix work better
1502749 current smoking was an independent predictor of low platelet aggregation
1502750 were trying to get funding for a trial right now
1502751 then we would remove the smoking in half the group
1502752 we would see whether that removal adds support for our observation
1502753 and were definitely not telling people to smoke if they have heart disease
1502754 either defense side interests or plaintiff side interests rather than some overview of global fairness
1502755 commercial fishermen native alaskans landowners businesses and local governments involved in the lawsuit have each received about 15 000 for having their lives and livelihood destroyed and havent received a dime of emotional distress damages
1502756 this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case that has ever been charged in this country
1502757 highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1502758 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1502759 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers

1502769 no and we have to hear it during our first kiss
1502770 ill tell you if i can if theres an afterlife if your lights flicker on and off thatll be me playing with the lights and telling you im still there
1502771 there is no reason to believe this is anything other than the simple burglary of a laptop which the local police are investigating
1502772 for it to be more than that the thief would have to hack into two different passwords and even then would not get what identity thieves want most a social security number and or credit card information
1502773 one of the things that really characterizes web 2 0 is the high interactivity between the user and other users as well as the application in sharing information
1502774 these little microapplications like google gadgets are ideal for that on the other hand if someone creates a gadget that is designed to trick the user thats easy to do

1502777 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1502778 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1502779 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1502780 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation

1502787 hemos decidido suspender el viaje a tarija porque hubo agresiones contra periodistas contra las delegaciones anticipadas de argentina y venezuela con un fascismo de las peores pocas
1502788 acusamos directamente al imperio de estados unidos que hace todo lo posible para evitar nuestra uni n
1502789 esto nos indica que el imperio americano no puede ser desestimado

1502802 this park was named after nathan bedford forest when i tried to change the name the only person that voted no was steve cohen
1502803 he talks out of both sides of his mouth on one hand he claims to be a friend of the minorities on the other he stood up to continue that awful statue of nathan bedford forest and what it stands for
1502804 this desperation attempt at the end to question my character people know what that is
1502805 its up for voters to decide all he asks us to do was to examine the record and thats what weve done
1502806 it doesnt need to have controversy on issues like that because it doesnt have anything to do with political issues steve cohen has been a good congressman i support him
1502807 but if he voted that way to preserve history i dont think hes saying thats him what he believes in
1502808 i dont think its a bad reflection on him i think it divides the community
1502809 we do say that if something happens we ask employees to come forward and share that
1502810 i think it was inadequate the way it was done before
1502811 i think theyre making good strides to improve the process

1502817 it was this propaganda that had been carried out in the world to unmake bangladesh to prove that breaking up with pakistan wasnt a viable alternative in the first place and unfortunately knowingly or unknowingly we are participating and or contributing to that propaganda today
1502818 why do we continue with the legacy of erroneous information and flawed interpretation and be a part of the anti bangladesh propaganda
1502819 bangladesh did not get even a year to prove the american diplomat ural alexis johnson wrong

1502821 we had many options but we decided this was the best place for him to show his talent
1502822 we felt it was best for him to race on a surface where he is already a champion and at a place where he can add to his legend he is very fit here and is a very happy horse here its a historic venue
1502823 i still think he can be a turf champion but im not sure he has enough time this year to make the adjustments the turf is not out of his future we werent disappointed in the results
1502824 the breeders cup has two races to consider were also invited to japan and hong kong were keeping all our options open
1502825 i think it is bad for racing to have trash talk
1502826 its unethical in football and other sports as well the attempt should be to show the animals at their best
1502827 i would love to meet big brown it would be great for the industry and the fans but all we can do is take one race at a time i dont know where it would be i suspect they might retire him before we ever get a chance to meet if we do i prefer it be on dirt and at a mile and a quarter

1502834 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
1502835 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because they are not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 stake
1502836 however it is remarkable that now there is no curb on press freedom in bangladesh although the country has been under emergency rule since the present caretaker government assumed power in january last year it is important to note that it is for the first time in bangladesh that there has not been a single instance of victimization persecution or harassment of journalists it is unprecedented in a country under emergency rule
1502837 a section of the press particularly a mainstream english daily in its editorial comments and columns has consistently engaged itself in scurrilous and vituperative attacks on every action and statement of the government in order to hold it up for ridicule hatred and disrepute to deliberately create disaffection among the public against the government in this context the mild government reaction by way of phone calls and press advice is considered government intereference if this is true as alleged by editors and representatives of journalist associations recently it can be better appreciated when viewed against the background of the generally continuing liberal attitude sic of the government towards the media
1502838 that there has not been a single instance of victimization persecution or harassment
1502839 there has not been a single instance of victimization persecution or harassment
1502840 and if youre being held hostage by a bunch of people giving
1502841 ethics of journalism was is and will always remain their highest priority
1502842 the author says that there has been no persecution of journalists under this government actually this statement is incorrect
1502843 the reason this little nugget of an op ed went through that net might be because of one employees mistake and s he has my sympathies but it is symptomatic of a much larger malaise no matter how much you deny it
1502844 if you believe it was a genuine mistake then you have to accept that the mistake has nothing to with the
1502845 sorry to disappoint but this had nothing to do with the daily stars editorial policy of down playing the lack of press freedom under the current government
1502846 i work for the daily star so i can criticize it who are you folks
1502847 oh i think you have a valid point but write about it more gently if you want to get published

1502851 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1502852 my view is that the fed is on hold at least through the fall and likely
1502853 the worries about inflation notwithstanding the fomc still started with a discussion of the economy the comments were not particularly sanguine the committee is likely to need some hard data that conditions are getting better before they start to unwind the rate cuts with payroll declines continuing it is hard right now to see how that could happen by years end
1502854 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1502855 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1502856 watch the employment data carefully a reappearance of job gains could change the outlook quickly
1502857 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1502858 theres no principal at work here other than being too lazy to either plan ahead or cover up its not fighting for a right its fighting for the spotlight you surely will get when you go all janet jackson on everyone and get to drink in the oohs and aahs from the other customers because
1502859 this is the defining moment for us bengalese to be truly independent once for all

1502861 consider the investigation just launched in washington over an apparent leak at the department of homeland security in which insiders seem to have tipped off relatives about an alleged threat to the new york city subway system
1502862 we should try to look at things in a broader time frame and nobody is too much different and most peopel look at things in a short term interest in 2001 getting rid of al was short term interest of mr anams
1502863 we knew with david going into the final criterium stage just two seconds down that with everyone pulling together we had a real shot at the overall win
1502864 we were willing to loose the race in order to win overall
1502865 if the breakaway had stayed out there with at least a thirty second gap bissell would have taken the overall race if the lead had stayed in place until the end our tactics put pressure on toyota united to ride tempo almost the entire race and kept the lead to under a minute
1502866 im tremendously proud of the way david and all our guys rode winning is always nice but this was a chance to test our ability to execute on a distinct race strategy and fine tune things ahead of downers grove in a few weeks
1502867 with two years of back to back competitive racing events in tandem with the bicycle industrys trade event interbike and the industry are helping vegas cultivate a culture of cycling
1502868 now that the show will be held in las vegas for a few more years we welcome crossvegas and swagger in making the city famous for great cycling events
1502869 with the addition of the wheelers and dealers race and the shuttle buses from the sands crossvegas is an even bigger part of the interbike experience
1502870 nobody should show up at interbike the day after the race and hear the words you shouldve been there
1502871 last years industry cup had some fierce racing with ex pros manufacturers independent reps and shop owners and staff racing each other
1502872 this year i wonder if last years racers and any new comers are willing to put their money where their mouths are and show us whos the fastest

1502883 an attempt has been made to give a bible which is more relevant for india there is nothing added or subtracted from the text of the bible which has been reproduced as such
1502884 we cannot simply have a re reproduction of the bible people must be able to assimilate and appreciate the bible the texts of the bible must come alive
1502885 but actually for us christ is the light we can use it as a prayer of divine light which illumine the human mind
1502886 for so many centuries we have not been able to read the text of the sacred scripture without indian traditions at the background our sacred text also must become meaningful to indians of different religions it will help to project our bible in their context

1502923 players dont know what cards they will be dealt or what cards will be dealt to the board while techniques for dealing with chance have been well established in the context of other games such as backgammon what sets poker apart is that it is a game of imperfect information

1502926 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles

1502945 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses chairman and chief executive rupert murdoch said
1502946 although we clearly face more challenging macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth mr murdoch said
1502947 that means that 24 hours a day every day for 100 years a stone averaging 3 5 tons needs to be set in place every 8 5 minutes

1502955 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1502956 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates

1503002 good regulation should drive competition and boost our productivity but too many new rules can stifle enterprise and blunt our competitive edge
1503003 if the uk is to remain a respected place to do business we must not expect business simply to absorb the costs of a stream of new government initiatives
1503004 the introduction of a regulatory budget for every department will focus new regulations on the real priorities and act as a powerful incentive for departments to cut or streamline existing burdens
1503005 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities

1503021 state takeover is the absolute last resort and there are no plans to implement that for any schools
1503022 might have convinced them that state takeover is not such a good idea
1503023 the basic problem with state takeover of a school is that many state departments of education are not equipped to do it
1503024 when it comes to no child left behind its layered over the state school reform
1503025 it doesnt quite fit like a hand into a glove
1503026 unfortunately what we see in most parts of the country is that states and school districts do nothing
1503027 there are so few places that have tried a fundamental overhauling of a school that we just dont know how to do that well
1503028 try to figure out if there is something at the district level that is contributing to these problems

1503079 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1503080 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1503081 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1503082 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1503083 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1503084 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1503085 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1503086 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1503087 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1503088 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1503089 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1503090 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1503091 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1503092 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1503093 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1503094 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1503095 al qaeda in iraq and al qaeda in pakistan is the same entity
1503096 there are hardly half a dozen writers in england today who have not sold out to the enemy
1503097 if the dna shows anything it will show how interconnected we all are it could possibly answer the question of his possible jewish background while a gene study might give us some insight into his psychopathic behavior it was probably more of a product of his abusive upbringing regardless of his background he was an angry evil man in the end it would help us all realize that we need to learn how to embrace the good in us and fight the evil regardless of our genetics in the end you do not need proof of hitlers genetics to learn this truth about humanity
1503098 we oppose the continued extensions and exceptions to the general principles to the statute of limitations requirements because when so many years pass before charges are brought it diminishes the accusers ability to mount a meaningful defense and erodes the principles upon which we base our criminal justice system
1503099 many states and the federal government are calling for legislation authorizing law enforcement to collect dna from for certain crime suspects when they are booked rather than waiting until after they are convicted of a felony
1503100 it seems to me to be a reasonable argument that taking a sample at booking is in essence requiring a person to give testimony against themselves a specific court order might be a better idea
1503101 started back in november of 2007 when after several years of cherry pitt neighbors complaining about the crime traffic and

1503103 i dont know what their definition of a business is but to my understanding a business is public anyone can just walk into it and you must pay to get in and we are none of that
1503104 i accept donations have you ever had your friends over for a barbecue and asked everyone to pitch in 5 or bring a dish that is exactly what we do the only requirement to get into my home is that you call and let me know that you are coming and you are on my reservation list
1503105 it boils down to people want to put their morality into my private home and i am going to stand against that
1503106 detrimental to the health safety and welfare of the city of duncanville
1503107 in an unexpectedly large step the court said traditional morality is no justification for making legal distinctions among sexual behaviors of consenting adults the fact that the governing majority in a state has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice justice anthony m kennedy wrote quoting approvingly from his colleague justice john paul stevens
1503108 we need to stick with the mission but rethink some of the ways we implement it it doesnt pay to stick with a bad idea
1503109 i do think our program has been stuck for awhile that the space shuttle program did not inspire the imaginations of the public that much of the experimentation that has been done could have been conducted not necessarily with manned flights
1503110 the apollo missions were abandoned because we simply had nowhere to go from there we didnt possess the technology budget or public support to advance the program we shifted our emphasis to less ambitious goals that were within our technological and financial reach leaving star trek visions behind

1503116 this group was one of the most vile antisemitic pro terrorist sites on the internet moreover it was the most active hate group of all heartily promoting hatred murder and genocide while proliferating abominable propaganda paralleled only by the fables of goebbels while such content clearly violates facebooks own terms of use and code of conduct provisions that users agree to abide when they register on the site facebook refused to take action despite thousands of user complaints over the course of eighteen months facebook allowed this group and its ubiquitous antisemitic lies to flourish facebooks own negligence and abdication of responsibility gave us no option but to take matters in our own hands we wish to be clear we have no issues with legitimate political discourse so long as it is contextual comparative and truthful however when it comes to encouraging the murder of jews and purposefully disseminating misinformation to demonize jews and to delegitimize israel there is a moral obligation to remove the platform of such repugnant hate mongers unfortunately we do not need to search too far back into history to realize that such evils have a real cost in terms of human lives

1503124 growing economies of scale technological breakthroughs and rising costs of competing fossil fuels play in favor of renewables and official institutions like the eia or the international energy agency iea may be too conservative when they only assume a slight rise in relative importance of renewable energies until 2030
1503125 for the gcc countries and their most important export good it needs to be stressed that with the exception of biofuels renewables are used for electricity and heat generation
1503126 would only change if in the very long run alternative fuels or new technologies would be developed e
1503127 in terms of growth rates solar and wind energy have the highest growth rates of all energy forms worldwide considerable hopes are pinned to them and if renewable energies acquire a larger share of the global energy mix in the future it will come from these two energy forms
1503128 what developments could be expected within the next decade what is the worst case scenario effect on oil
1503129 land use for biofuels currently constitutes only 1 percent of total acreage worldwide 14 million hectares a figure that the iea sees increasing to 35 million hectares by 2030
1503130 biofuels are unlikely to lead to large scale replacements of fossil fuels due to limited availability of land competition with food production and a questionable energy balance in the case of ethanol production from corn
1503131 a detailed study by new energy finance assumes a number at the lower end of estimates with biofuels responsible for up to 8
1503132 research by the us energy department estimates that biofuel from algae could theoretically replace all the petroleum consumed in the us
1503133 high costs of fossil fuels alongside technological breakthroughs and decreasing costs with growing economies of scale will play out well for renewable energies in the future despite capacity constraints that need to be overcome renewable energies have developed into an industry to reckon with and are also underpinned by growing government support and concerns about global warming
1503134 the trans mediterranean renewable energy cooperation trec is pursuing the desertec project which aims at building large scale csp plants in north africa and transport the produced electricity via high voltage direct current cables to europe both already proven technologies
1503135 abu dhabis masdar initiative is the most significant initiative for renewable energy in the gcc thus far abu dhabi has taken on the saudi initiatives of the 1980s on a much larger scale in order to take advantage of the technological progress and the improved economics that have taken place in renewable energy since then
1503136 renewable energies are about to capture a significant portion of the global energy mix
1503137 as such the amount of wind energy over land could potentially cover over five times the current global energy and about 40 times the current electricity uses with little incremental pollution

1503275 ive been able to win 12 times out here but ive never been able to get it done in a major i never even really played well until 96 when i lost in the playoff to mark brooks at the pga at valhalla back home in kentucky so i havent had much success other than that week in all the majors
1503276 puttings always held me back for the past three months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period if i putt somewhere near like i putted this summer ive got a great shot this week
1503277 set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september this will be a great place to do it

1503279 and you need to go that direction regardless of the scrutiny
1503280 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far

1503282 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1503283 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1503284 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sheriffs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1503285 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately

1503296 by law sellers are not obligated to disclose that the property is or has been ill skip to paragraph 3 located in the vicinity of a sex offender
1503297 but if you keep reading it goes on to say
1503298 disclose it even if it they dont ask that would probably kill the deal
1503299 well its better to kill the deal now than end up in court later and actually

1503304 my ball club is going through a pretty tough time right now and i got to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
1503305 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not

1503307 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1503308 if people know olivo thats the way he is im not saying hes wrong or right i managed him and know the way he is if olivo thought it was a purpose pitch he made the right decision
1503309 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1503310 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1503311 he didnt really try to fight olivo really or anyone
1503312 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1503313 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1503314 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1503315 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1503316 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1503317 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future

1503323 was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no
1503324 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
1503325 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution
1503326 which were once so popular that the company couldnt keep pace with demand are now piling up in warehouses
1503327 today crocs shoes are available all over the world and on the internet as we continue to significantly expand all aspects of our business

1503338 we got it at the right time with the runner in scoring position with one swing of the bat it could have gone either way and this time it went our way
1503339 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1503340 after making a deal with the state where felony charges were dismissed so that he could get himself reinstated with the nfl
1503341 nine months later he comes forward with this story about how mr edwards did this
1503342 after the state agreed not to prosecute him for these attempted murders
1503343 i think he needs to look at all the discovery before he goes popping off like that
1503344 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1503345 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over

1503360 it is sad that we have reached a point in this country where exercising freedom of speech becomes a chargeable offense
1503361 and that a decision vindicating that basic freedom is seen as a victory and not the natural birthright of a free people
1503362 hey hey u of a how many kids did you jail today

1503368 trotskys writings were readily available throughout the school kutva where haywood and others were studying and the issues of the struggle were constantly on the agenda in our collectives these were discussed in our classes as they were in factories schools and peasant organizations throughout the country

1503392 the peculiar feature of the united states the availability of unoccupied free land
1503393 the extremity and wide and rapid development of capitalism in the united states
1503394 the evil system of colonialism and imperialism grew up along with the enslavement of negroes and the trade in negroes and it will surely come to its end with the thorough emancipation of the black people
1503395 the struggle of the black people in the united states is bound to merge with the american workers movement and this will eventually end the criminal rule of the u s monopoly capitalist class

1503398 el gobierno act a al mejor estilo de los gobiernos dictatoriales y fascistas y el nico responsable es evo morales y todos sus ministros incapaces especialmente el ministro de gobierno rada que manda polic as para que nos masacre
1503399 nos hemos enterado por informes de la polic a que se produjeron refriegas a la altura de caihuasi de refriegas y enfrentamientos con la polic a que usaba agentes qu micos y mineros que hacian detonar cargas de dinamita

1503412 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1503413 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1503414 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1503415 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1503416 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1503417 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1503418 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1503419 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1503420 ending appreciation cutting rates and relaxing lending curbs would certainly support growth
1503421 it also would risk pushing chinese inflation up to the levels seen in the gulf
1503422 it has the policy tools available to shift the basis of its growth
1503423 the political will to do so though seems lacking at least for now
1503424 in the current rate environment nobody really wants to stick their neck out
1503425 the fed is trying to address this the question remains how effective it has been
1503426 we basically watched day by day by day for months and waited for a perfect window
1503427 and lo and behold we got a half a window
1503428 we thought it was kind of a second half of 2007 issue
1503429 i hope the market will improve in the second half of the year but negative sentiment is still prevalent
1503430 the prudent course of action is to get in and out quickly because windows of opportunity dont last very long

1503439 throughout my entire life there has been injustice and repression in cuba never in my lifetime have the people of cuba known freedom never in the lives of two generations of cubans have the people of cuba known democracy this is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century of elections that are anything but free or fair i wont stand for this injustice you wont stand for this injustice and together we will stand up for freedom in cuba
1503440 its time to let cuban american money make their families less dependent upon the castro regime i will maintain the embargo
1503441 the united states has made it clear that we wont stand for foreign intervention in our hemisphere but every day all across the americas there is a different kind of struggle not against foreign armies but against the deadly threat of hunger and thirst disease and despair that is not a future that we have to accept not for the child in port au prince or the family in the highlands of peru we can do better we must do better we cannot ignore suffering to our south nor stand for the globalization of the empty stomach
1503442 i will reinstate a special envoy for the americas in my white house who will work with my full support but well also expand the foreign service and open more consulates in the neglected regions of the americas well expand the peace corps and ask more young americans to go abroad to deepen the trust and the ties among our people

1503451 paraconsistent tense logic the metaphysics of change and the epistemic consequences of dialetheism
1503452 graham priest has argued that there are some true contradictions but that the statistical frequency of true contradictions is very low and that as such the epistemic probability of any particular contradiction being true is very low this claim is essential to his justification for the classical re capture at the same time priest has identified some concrete extra semantic candidates for the status of true contradictions in analysis of the metaphysics of change expressed in terms of a paraconsistent logic his own lp outfitted with tense operators like p which can be read as it was the case that priest argues for zenos law the principle that amp p entails the disjunction of amp or p amp despite his repeated claims to the contrary it will become clear that priest is so deeply committed to the tensed theory of time that his analysis falls apart once the tenseless theory is substituted more importantly priests argument for zenos law exhibits a methodology which undermines his claim that the statistical frequency of true contradictions is very low a closer examination of this point should demonstrate that there is no good reason why arguments at least as good in more mundane contexts couldnt turn up enough true contradictions to overturn the claim that the statistical frequency of true contradictions is very low as such if dialetheism is correct we are not justified in generally assigning low epistemic probabilities to contradictory outcomes in our arguments and the classical re capture fails
1503453 involve us in untangling one of the most basic conflations in the logical literature the conflation of negation and denial
1503454 would take us far from the topic of the book
1503455 when approaching sentences like the liar we risk paradox if we ignore the difference between negation and denial
1503456 we included a formal rule to ban inconsistency and amazingly no inconsistencies were generated by he model
1503457 every one has a camera the magic of photography is over but the art of photography is just beginning
1503458 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state
1503459 the powers of the national legislature are defined and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten the constitution is written
1503460 by the houses of representatives and the senate of the 2
1503461 the price of victory is high but so are the rewards
1503462 my conditional is not the conditional of classical logic and given that you cant make the inference from to with it
1503463 1 they could deny that the original sentence was a truth bearer e g on kripkes ground
1503464 i agree why are philosophers so hung up on the notion that god must be all powerful wouldnt it be enough if god were just the most powerful thing in existence thats still pretty powerful
1503465 i believe in an immaterial eternal entity that created everything other than itself in existence that controls who goes where in the afterlife that has issued various commandments as to how humans should live and is immensely unfathomably powerful far far more powerful than any other entity that has ever existed or will ever exist by orders of magnitude but i dont believe that this entity is quite literally all powerful
1503466 this sentence exists whatever that means and it states a lie
1503467 its true this sentence exists yet this sentence does not state truth
1503468 there are no counter examples to the lnc therefore the liar is not a counter example to the lnc

1503479 the new policy will be forced cohabitation with homosexuals 24 7 in all military communities including army and marine infantry battalions special operations forces navy seals and all the ships at sea including submarines
1503480 taking the civil rights argument to its logical misguided conclusion the military will be required to give special rights to professed not discreet homosexuals and enforce a corollary policy of zero tolerance of anyone who disagrees
1503481 current incidents of sexual misconduct involving men and women will be increased three fold to include male male and female female issues
1503482 to make the new policy work valuable training time will be diverted to diversity training reflecting the attitudes of civilian gay activist groups
1503483 any complaints about inappropriate passive aggressive actions conveying a homosexual message or approach short of physical touching and assault will be met with career killing presumptions about the motives of the person who complains bigotry homophobia racism or worse as a result untold thousands of people to leave or avoid the all volunteer force

1503490 what the dialetheist is essentially doing is suggesting that true is equivocal there is an unadulterated truth so to speak which is classical t and there is another kind of truth which is truth as found united to falsehood which union some dialetheists represent by b
1503491 impressive scientist x believed p and he also believed theory q and he knew that theory q entails that not p but he didnt derive just any claim r so the underlying logic he was using was clearly not classical
1503492 if it is not the case that it is not the case that it is not the case that it is not the case that it is not the case that the special theory of relativity is true then it is not the case that it is not the case that it is not the case that it is not the case either that hitler won world war ii or that the national flag of australia is a pirate flag containing a jewel that under magnification is revealed to be a detailed map of the surface of mars with an x marking the spot where elvis has high tea every afternoon at four with the mad hatter and a ghostly semi physical representative of the hegelian world spirit

1503497 do not vote against business interests and if you do avoid having represented criminal defendants at any time in your career
1503498 a powerful special interest group wmc decided that i had to go
1503499 simply because he did not support business interests 100 percent of the time
1503500 wmc has no interest in criminal cases but i could not be attacked because of the liability rulings but i could be attacked because i had the audacity to represent criminal defendants at one point in my career i could easily be attacked for doing what i was supposed to do wmc therefore recruited and found a candidate who had a prosecutorial background to contrast with his and ran ads unfairly attacking him for representing a defendant on an appeal falsely suggesting that it resulted in a child being raped

1503502 if x exists we expect to see some ys and if it doesnt wed expected to see some zs so i expect to see both ys and zs
1503503 if there are true contradictions using classical logic is probably not a good way to model how they work
1503504 the possibility of affirming logical contradictions is strongly unintuitive but this is not the only reason to reject the possibility of affirming logical contradictions for those who lack this intuition or perhaps the intuition isnt very strong you can consider the following proof which shows that if you accept any logical contradiction you can prove anything
1503505 if i can be sure of anything on the basis of my immediate experience of the world its that some statements are false and not also true if dialetheism generates the possibility that im wrong about that then dialetheism is wrong

1503513 the overall results are very encouraging and indicate a favorable outcome with many types of tags and readers this project has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of rfid for specific applications and has the potential to satisfy many common use cases especially inventory management
1503514 it suggested influence on read rates from such things as tag type reader type tag location fixture type and number of items on a fixture
1503515 i think that this atmosphere of fear is completely unwarranted
1503516 it was not the passengers of the plane that were concerned these reactions clearly illustrate how vastly things can be blown out of proportion
1503517 in this country theres a nonviolent tradition of civil disobedience were really not told the truth about 9 11 theres a moral imperative to get that message out

1503529 husbands should take full care of their wives with the bounties god has given to some more than others and with what they spend out of their own money
1503530 righteous wives are devout and guard what god would have them guard in the husbands absence
1503531 if you fear high handedness from your wives remind them of the teaching of god then ignore them when you go to bed then hit them
1503532 if the beatings were for the purpose of revenge the husband would sin
1503533 could any of you beat his wife as he would beat a slave and then lie with her in the evening

1503551 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1503552 im all for it they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget to keep it going they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because there are enough engineers and r amp d research and development and technology that help us keep getting longer
1503553 if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway and hit a more crisp and a better golf shot its probably a good avenue i think its a positive move

1503582 a slave wife is still a slave and cant say no and have it stick i know this upsets you but it is part of being a slave she became a slave because of bad decisions i became a slave to protect myself by getting a protected situation either way we are slaves we appreciate good treatment and we like being used in a pleasant manner please keep doing it

1503591 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1503592 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1503593 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game

1503629 the fatties in which he plays every member of a flatulent obese family
1503630 the joke is an actor who takes himself so seriously that he ridiculously thinks he can immerse himself in this role stiller says
1503631 there were very few actors i thought could do it any sane person would have reservations

1503670 we go to the church to reach out to the women in the community because our main focus is children under five years old and pregnant and lactating women they are the ones who are most vulnerable to malaria
1503671 basically were trying to empower the church to help others we identify leaders and train them to help other neighboring dioceses
1503672 we help mobilize the community to look for ways to help prevent malaria if theyre next to water that is standing still that is a breeding ground for malaria we help them to deal with that its working with the community to also be part of the solution
1503673 when we say indirect regarding malaria prevention each person educated tells three other people according to our program evaluation so the bottom line is that the message is spread to 10 million people over the three year period
1503674 its a massive undertaking the church in africa has taken on
1503675 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1503676 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1503677 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1503678 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1503679 our path is to deeply plant the roots of wisdom
1503680 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1503681 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1503682 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet

1503684 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
1503685 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
1503686 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste

1503702 growing economies of scale technological breakthroughs and rising costs of competing fossil fuels play in favor of renewables and official institutions like the eia or the international energy agency iea may be too conservative when they only assume a slight rise in relative importance of renewable energies until 2030
1503703 for the gcc countries and their most important export good it needs to be stressed that with the exception of biofuels renewables are used for electricity and heat generation
1503704 would only change if in the very long run alternative fuels or new technologies would be developed e
1503705 in terms of growth rates solar and wind energy have the highest growth rates of all energy forms worldwide considerable hopes are pinned to them and if renewable energies acquire a larger share of the global energy mix in the future it will come from these two energy forms
1503706 what developments could be expected within the next decade what is the worst case scenario effect on oil
1503707 land use for biofuels currently constitutes only 1 percent of total acreage worldwide 14 million hectares a figure that the iea sees increasing to 35 million hectares by 2030
1503708 biofuels are unlikely to lead to large scale replacements of fossil fuels due to limited availability of land competition with food production and a questionable energy balance in the case of ethanol production from corn
1503709 a detailed study by new energy finance assumes a number at the lower end of estimates with biofuels responsible for up to 8
1503710 research by the us energy department estimates that biofuel from algae could theoretically replace all the petroleum consumed in the us
1503711 high costs of fossil fuels alongside technological breakthroughs and decreasing costs with growing economies of scale will play out well for renewable energies in the future despite capacity constraints that need to be overcome renewable energies have developed into an industry to reckon with and are also underpinned by growing government support and concerns about global warming
1503712 the trans mediterranean renewable energy cooperation trec is pursuing the desertec project which aims at building large scale csp plants in north africa and transport the produced electricity via high voltage direct current cables to europe both already proven technologies
1503713 abu dhabis masdar initiative is the most significant initiative for renewable energy in the gcc thus far abu dhabi has taken on the saudi initiatives of the 1980s on a much larger scale in order to take advantage of the technological progress and the improved economics that have taken place in renewable energy since then
1503714 renewable energies are about to capture a significant portion of the global energy mix
1503715 as such the amount of wind energy over land could potentially cover over five times the current global energy and about 40 times the current electricity uses with little incremental pollution
1503716 i just bought a used kinetico water filtration system online and its scheduled for delivery soon i am mentally preparing myself to either install it myself or worse to pay a plumber to install it i am also considering calling the local kinetico dealer to install it so that they can verify it has the correct metering discs etc to ensure it works for my familys water usage and to test the hardness and chlorine content of the treated water to verify the effectiveness of the resin and the carbon in the used system can anyone offer advice on what kinds of questions i should ask an installer before allowing them to install the system and how much i might anticipate paying a plumber and or kinetico dealer to install the system note the system will be installed in my garage against the wall where the water main should be entering the house and next to my sprinkler system control panel i assume the plumbing can be done with minimal digging and only a couple of penetrations drilled through the brick

1503743 bagi mereka yang mencintai dan berasa bahawa mereka terhutang kesetiaan yang tidak berbelah bagi kami menyambut mereka sebagai orang malaya mereka harus merupakan orang malaya yang benar dan mereka akan mempunyai hak hak dan hak hak istimewa yang sama dengan orang orang melayu

1503806 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
1503807 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
1503808 you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
1503809 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
1503810 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something

1503814 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1503815 on the organized crime side they have gotten better organized the bad guys have continued to grow up
1503816 we still ended up finding a lot that was interesting
1503817 one speaker told me he didnt want to show up at his own talk
1503818 all of us here in denver health are keeping dr masoudi and his family in our thoughts and prayers and providing them time to heal as a family
1503819 people are talking about how devastating it was how sad that it never should have happened
1503820 its a bit quiet today people are trying to figure out how it happened why it happened
1503821 likable a gung ho type guy ready to take charge
1503822 when the bobcats hired him it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better
1503823 hiring larry brown an elite coach you have to take notice of that
1503824 larry brown he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better
1503825 i think hes a perfect fit for us our team is young we are hard working and he can give us that discipline and those little insights to the game that will take us to the next level
1503826 hopefully in the back of my mind i wanted to be a bobcat
1503827 sometimes things dont work out the way you want them to in this case they did worrying about the contract negotiations and stuff that would have been just extra stress that i really didnt need to have
1503828 he might not have been nervous but im sure we were in a lot of ways
1503829 i was a college player so i knew i wasnt going to see the light of day
1503830 biyen jamanne simbok pas gek jaman landa njajah kene simbok karo mbah lanangmu nggawe luangan nang ngisor mejo kuwi men kompeni ora weruh
1503831 it seemed to me that episodes in australian history that are best known are those that have strong images attached to them like the petrov affair because of those images of mrs petrov losing her shoe at darwin airport
1503832 consequently chifley has always been a bit of a misty figure for me personally and for others
1503833 through firsthand experience we tried to bring the character alive because the archival images are grey and dull and formal
1503834 i felt it was a film that urgently needed to be made
1503835 but i dont see it so much as a political bit of agitprop i see it as a very human story
1503836 kenny is probably the best possible movie you could make based on a single relentless shit gag
1503837 when we were making some of those early films i had no idea anyone would even see them jacks wife theres always vanilla we never thought they would ever go anywhere
1503838 some of the early stuff i just wasnt in control of it
1503839 i didnt know what i was doing it took a few years for me to feel at all comfortable and the first film was all instrument flying and rip offs ripping off shots from orson welles
1503840 the anger in night was children of the 1960s who were pissed off that peace and love hadnt changed the world
1503841 we cast a black guy just because he was the best actor from among our friends
1503842 it was one of the biggest elements that made people sit up and take notice back then duane was much more sensitive to it than any of us were we just thought we were being very hip by not questioning the script on the page in which he was written as a white guy
1503843 ive tried to make all five of them a bit different and from the decade in which they were made and show snapshots of that time
1503844 i have this way of making films about what i see happening out there and i can bring the zombies out of the closet at any time and get a deal
1503845 it was pretty presumptuous of me to make a womans movie without having that single important qualification
1503846 i guess the message to impart is find something that you care about you have to have a little something to say unfortunately a lot of fans of my stuff particularly in the us are just in it for the gore if its not there theyre disappointed
1503847 i wish somebody could explain it to me i mean it seems to me if theres a real anger there on the part of the filmmakers i dont know what its about its not sociopolitical its not based on anything maybe its based on how much gasoline costs or how much their shoes cost
1503848 i havent been able to find a reason for it or what place it has
1503849 most of us were really pissed off that our country wasnt doing the right thing and things all of a sudden were worse and not better
1503850 we didnt speak directly about that but thats where the fumes came from
1503851 it was about a woman working for the resistance during world war ii in france
1503852 she died at 98 years of age childless and that affected me thats what gave me the idea for the character that sophie marceau plays in the film
1503853 we were all asking ourselves how could we survive this and i think it was also important to have a duty of memory a duty to the truth that was very important
1503854 when we were shooting the passages of the interrogation i wanted it to be as close as possible to reality so we based it on written testimonies of people interrogated by the gestapo
1503855 the french notice if budapest or some other city stands in for paris others may not but we do
1503856 also the original prisons and cellars are imbued with an emotion that is difficult to re create in a studio
1503857 quite imperturbable and would remain cool and collected in any situation
1503858 i was very interested in fact to put women into roles generally taken by men where they live it in a very different way and showing the different sensitivities of women and of men and at the same time to show that when women were interrogated the enemy didnt make any concession to them so they had to endure that as well
1503859 but when the film was finished some of them came and even if they knew it was fictional they were quite overwhelmed at seeing their roles if not exactly themselves portrayed
1503860 its true we had some reaction some said it was too fictional but the main thing was to see the emotion of those women who received some recognition for what they had done because in france it was not known at all
1503861 the 5 star ratings for the flex are evidence of fords overall safety commitment in fact we have produced more 5 star rated vehicles than any other automaker
1503862 the flex offers it all a head turning design top safety ratings unsurpassed highway fuel efficiency in its segment power spaciousness comfort and great features
1503863 flex safety is built on a solid foundation the platform of the 5 star rated ford taurus and taurus x
1503864 safety is a top purchase consideration second only to fuel efficiency so flexs top safety ratings and highway fuel economy are a winning combination
1503865 it wasnt uncommon before for people to come in and just weigh them baggage to find out if they were over the limit but now when we see people come in with luggage its normally to ship it
1503866 you would have to bring it in ahead of time to be able to get the ground service rates
1503867 i think that i will always be checking i wont do any shipping it would be too confusing for me
1503868 i love walking around this lake its kind of a refreshing change of pace from driving through the cities its nice and calm
1503869 three of them went over to the couple and asked them a few questions they didnt like the answer from the young man and a fight ensured

1503892 legislation to create new underwriting standards will reduce competition and restrict consumer access to credit additionally efforts to bail out or shore up lending institutions creates a moral hazard that would slow the adjustments required in the marketplace
1503893 these bail out proposals would fundamentally alter the workings of the mortgage market leaving consumers with fewer choices when seeking to buy a home and potentially increasing taxpayer exposure for bad loans

1503908 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1503909 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1503925 truth eludes us if we do not concentrate with total attention on its pursuit and even while it eludes us the illusion still lingers of knowing it and leads to many misunderstandings also truth is seldom pleasant it is almost invariably bitter
1503926 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society of course there are many courageous individuals but they have no determining influence on public life political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice and decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and weak countries not supported by anyone or with currents which cannot offer any resistance but they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists
1503927 should one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end

1503960 absolutely brilliant m christian explores the meaning of identity and humanity in a generic world where literally everything can be manufactured a world frighteningly like our own
1503961 me2 is a unique and always entertaining fable novel about what exactly identity may entail and how we may or may not decide whether its worth the price of keeping it
1503962 m christian has a delightful marvelously twisted way with words which cause his narratives to crawl beneath your skin and fester there making you go back for more he writes with a strong unique voice which is not only entertaining but also makes you think makes you ponder the improbable youll think youve read this delicious fast paced story but did you or was it you
1503963 with delicious slyness m christian creates a world in which the familiar becomes sinister and the comfort of daily routine is replaced by a growing sense of dread his modern parable lays bare the all too real dangers inherent in the sacrifice of individuality in the pursuit of cultural homogenization

1503972 and we just walked to the exit door and theres that huge slide

1503974 weve fared this pretty well thank god weve had a lot worse
1503975 women fought for trousers were doing the same with the skirt

1503977 i could wear an earring neck chinas grow a pony tail any of these would be perceived as expressing my individuality but put on a skirt well have i turned
1503978 if you think in anatomical terms for men to have a centre seam is illogical
1503979 in the west men have not always worn trousers it was with the evolution of tailoring from the 14th century that bifurcated garments gradually became associated with mens dress and masculinity previously both men and women wore draped or unshaped garments and tunics
1503980 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1503981 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1503982 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1503983 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1503984 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1503985 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1503986 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see
1503987 it was a terrible day and everyone did what needed to be done except for the death of my parents it was the worst day of my life he shot three people id gone to high school with two of which died
1503988 i guess it makes you appreciate life more you know death can fall out of the sky but after all these years i still have the occasional dream of the images
1503989 as we were walking down the inner campus drive somebody was screaming at us to take cover
1503990 i guess with the adrenaline and all i got a mild case of heatstroke there were a bunch of hedges there and i went and sat in the shade i was getting dizzy and nauseous when i came out from the hedge all the bodies were still there and you could tell this woman was very very pregnant and it occurred to me if i was going through that much trouble i couldnt imagine what she was going through it was intolerable
1503991 james love and i were the ones who carried claire wilson the pregnant lady i grabbed her ankles and he grabbed her wrists
1503992 there was a big wall there then there were other people they took her farther down the driveway to where the ambulances were waiting
1503993 the majority of the people he hit were hit in the head or the torso when i think about it i can still feel a little cold spot in the middle of my shoulder blades where i thought a shot was going to go in
1503994 but i didnt really see much choice none of us did
1503995 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1503996 ron suskind has chosen to dwell in the netherworld of bizarre conspiracy theories the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1503997 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1503998 the reaction inside the white house was one of surprise then skepticism from the president on down after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case he told an aide
1503999 the report stated that according to habbush saddam had ended his nuclear program in 1991 the same year he destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile iraq had no intention habbush said of restarting either program
1504000 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1504001 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1504002 the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
1504003 as every report and commission on pre war intelligence has concluded the saddam hussein wanted his neighbors to believe he had weapons of mass destruction in fact he had previously used wmd to murder hundreds of thousands of his own people our intelligence estimates at the time and intelligence estimates from other nations believed that he still harbored such weapons we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1504004 the white house had finally thought of a way to use habbush
1504005 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1504006 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1504007 i have no reason at all to think the agency was directed to fabricate the letter or that anyone here did so in fact a document like that would have contradicted cias position on the relationship between al qaeda and saddam hussein it doesnt make any sense if that allegation is typical of the book it should be re shelved under fiction
1504008 i spoke to high ranking officials in the cia who had direct first hand knowledge of who said what to whom many of them keep daybooks and ledgers and notes so they can get things exactly right they are on the record in extensive statements in the book and the book stands solidly as evidence
1504009 its regrettable though expected that the white house would react this way if they reacted any other way they would have to answer questions that might have some legal consequences
1504010 many of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for five years
1504011 some of the sources especially some of the off the record sources felt that at the end of this bush era it is imperative to be truthful about this issue going to war under false pretenses so that we settle accounts and people understand what occurred and what the truth is so we can get past this as a country that is a big part of what some i think of the motivations were when they had the opportunity to finally speak
1504012 we believe that itll present a very compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which has not historically been true
1504013 the client side of the it environment is one the last bastions of proprietary technology it has been disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1504014 i can hardly name an area where we need more choice
1504015 i cant wait till hayhays walking all over and keeps busy
1504016 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1504017 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1504018 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1504019 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1504020 there is very much an interest in moving the financing from us to the iraqis in terms of the united states no longer being involved in the physical reconstruction business
1504021 i drive about 35 miles round trip to work every day so this recycle made a good deal on my gas tank
1504022 i put most of it in my tank over half of it in my gas tank and thatll last me two weeks worth of going to work and back
1504023 theyre bringing in everything theyre bringing in scrap iron and steel aluminum brass stainless steel
1504024 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1504025 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1504026 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank
1504027 it used to all be for my kids now i use some to pay for gas
1504028 theres a lot of 80 year old farm stuff in the fields from what ive seen people drag in
1504029 we have real collectors with 200 pounds and the little grandmother bringing them down in the back of her cadillac five pounds at a time
1504030 the economy only puts more pressure on people to save money and conserve resources
1504031 people of a certain economic status are willing to turn anything over for cash
1504032 theyre going to pick up the old radiator theyre going to pick up the old swing and bring it to recycle
1504033 every time you walk by its like walking over a 20 bill in your garage now i dont throw anything away
1504034 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1504035 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case thats ever been charged in this country
1504036 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and then install computer programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1504037 its alleged that in the course of their sophisticated conspiracy gonzalez and his co conspirators obtained credit and debit card information by war driving war driving is simply driving around in a car with a laptop computer looking for accessible wireless computer networks
1504038 some of the data that the conspirators did not sell they cashed out by encoding card numbers on magnetic strips of blank cards which they then used to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atm machines
1504039 but it was three investigations going on in three u s attorneys offices that eventually were coordinated and it was realized it was one ring of people who were who were involved in this
1504040 with the worldwide reach of the internet criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the globe to steal personal information from anywhere from almost anywhere on the globe in particular from our citizens
1504041 and when they do there are international online marketplaces where they can peddle that stolen information
1504042 obviously we werent happy that the person we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1504043 what is the big fuss about filling out an application before you protest is that not the case in canada or anywhere else in the world
1504044 the corruption and politicization of the olympics has never been more evident that in the awarding of the 2008 games to china nobody can be surprised about what is happening
1504045 im pleased to see that china allows people to protest at certain sites
1504046 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done

1504051 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1504052 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1504053 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1504054 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1504055 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1504056 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1504057 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence

1504096 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1504097 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1504098 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1504099 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1504100 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated

1504358 no just thinking about the dream i had last night
1504359 yakut i havent heard that name in what twenty years longer
1504360 it was before ares put us in the ice cave so twenty five years plus the last time we heard from her was when you gave eve your rite of caste and she was initiated into yakuts tribe
1504361 thats right i remember there had been a battle against nomads and yakut and amarice were killed
1504362 didnt it also have something to do with a sacred dagger what was it called the umat or something like that
1504363 it was the utma and the woman savior they brought from the future was also the utma if i remember right her name was cyane
1504364 she was warning me about some kind of danger something evil and mystical she kept fading in and out like it was all she could do to keep from being pulled back into the land of the dead before she could finish
1504365 she was kind of vague but she kept insisting both of us were in grave danger from an evil and mystical apparition or force something
1504366 well if its evil and mystical then i can only think of one person vile enough and magical enough to worry about
1504367 her body is dead but not her evil spirit evil like that never truly dies
1504368 she said there is a powerful shaman named morgar we need to find she said he isnt powerful enough to protect us but with her help he will have enough magic to bring a protector to us
1504369 she didnt happen to mention where we can find this morgar did she
1504370 not exactly just that if we go back to the tribe we will find him or he will find us
1504371 but after so long they might have died off or left their hunting lands
1504372 yakut assured me we that if we followed the same trail as before we will find each other
1504373 no i dont think so i got the impression they tolerate his nearness because he is very powerful but whether its because they fear him or because he helps them i dont know i guess well find out
1504374 i think we should if it was just me maybe i wouldnt but i cant take the chance something might happen to you
1504375 so i guess we should see about supplies and heavy coats for the journey huh
1504376 i guess we should since were low on dinars i think i need do some hunting before we get to the next village theres always a market for freshly killed deer
1504377 and i can set snares and catch fish as i recall theres a river about a days ride from here
1504378 sounds like a pretty good plan well split up for a few days ill get a deer or two and you can trap rabbits or whatever and catch as many fish as you can
1504379 might as well it wont take that long maybe ill butcher the deer well just have to see how it goes

1504409 creio que nessa altura pelo que havia dito ou escrito j se podia conhecer a fei o do meu esp rito sabiam quem eu era e que n o iria impor a ningu m o que penso sobre o cristianismo
1504410 sem que ningu m visse as cores por que passou o meu rosto que eu soube que o papa jo o xxiii me queria bispo de aveiro
1504411 n o consegui dormir nunca sou capaz de dormir num comboio ou mesmo num avi o
1504412 ao contr rio dos outros padres ou seminaristas a quem era imposta a diocese de origem
1504413 agora vinha a hora de dar a aveiro a parte que lhe pertencia
1504414 tomar parte num conc lio ecum nico um privil gio que nem a todos os bispos dado a usufruir
1504415 h homens que se gabam de nunca terem chorado diante de uma dificuldade eu n o posso dizer o mesmo
1504416 fui chamado a servir a igreja num per odo dif cil
1504417 meu filho at agora tens sido tu a pedir a minha b n o daqui em diante vamos inverter as coisas n o ser s tu a pedir a minha b n o mas eu a pedir a tua
1504418 meu pai compreendera o que eu passara a ser e dado que a terra onde ele vivia pertencia diocese que eu ia pastorear eu passava a ser bispo de meu pai ele entendia estas coisas meu pai era um contemplativo

1504429 what this does is help us to see what its like to live in substandard housing and inspire us to do something about it
1504430 the unions been keeping up and doing it for habitat for humanity for quite a long time now
1504431 treatment is the best method and two years of treatment gives you pretty good protection before the tree becomes infested so we like to see two years of treatment before the insects get to our area
1504432 the amount of chemical used is based on diameter of the tree which is absorbed through the roots of the tree and the chemical goes into the crown of the tree the insect digests it and dies but it works best as a preventative rather than curative
1504433 there are treatments available and there are individual treatments it can be very costly
1504434 i dont understand why anyone would take a wheelchair that was sitting outside drying the sun
1504435 i am just thrilled i cant thank these people at accessibility enough

1504442 we would have been dead all four of us would have been dead
1504443 what he has done is agree to take a look at the policy
1504444 frankly hes gates been approached by people on both sides of the issue and hes agreed to take a look at it and see if any changes are warranted
1504445 to put oil rigs in the last unfettered american military training range thats out in the eastern gulf of mexico
1504446 well have to wait and see what he gates puts out
1504447 maybe he gates wants to sort of expand the approach and say ok theres an energy situation and well look at it drilling applications on a case by case basis
1504448 and it will give republicans room to run with the ball
1504449 i can tell you that the gang of 10 was in contact with the department of defense
1504450 various members of the group had communicated with secretary gates
1504451 we have said many times that military parameters are paramount if there is a serious issue the militarys needs are going to win
1504452 the body mist has a nice cooling effect i used it immediately after my shower the fragrance is almost unnoticeable which is nice since i like to wear my own perfume i did not notice a huge difference in the texture of my skin although it did make it feel somewhat softer immediately after use i think this is something i will keep in my beach bag then i can enjoy the cooling sensation post beach or pool

1504459 the average number of bees in a hive is between 30 000 and 60 000
1504460 weve created this site because honey bee populations are disappearing at an alarming rate and we want to keep those little heroes buzzing
1504461 welcome to the hive here youll learn more about the daily life of a honey bee
1504462 inside a hive and followed bees in flight to capture closeups of honeybee behavior
1504463 the main symptom of ccd is simply no or a low number of adult honey bees present but with a live queen and no dead honey bees in the hive often there is still honey in the hive and immature bees brood are present
1504464 this report is a preliminary review based on no actual receipts data its based on national economic indications that anticipate a continuing decline in economic activity
1504465 it causes us concern but its way too early to translate that into a revenue shortfall were hoping things turn around
1504466 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time
1504467 as far as im aware his intentions are precisely as he stated them at the end of last year
1504468 the only ambition that we should be focused on today is the ambition of kevin rudd to become prime minister on the basis of one false hope one false promise after another
1504469 it was sort of a joke that somebody said has been set up for four years but the way that amy ryan played it was just so real and so earnest and the the writers also i felt like we were really successful in playing kevin the way that he is and it was just the notion of this idea being brought up that enabled people to have a different perception
1504470 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1504471 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1504472 its a frustrating process for any athlete whos ever gone through it to be at the top of the game moving around and all of a sudden going to the bathroom is one of the hardest things to do
1504473 it has been a struggle its also been a great learning experience
1504474 increasing the overall number of higher degree scholarships and specifically increasing the number of targeted higher degree scholarships will help sustain and develop tertiary qualified professionals to meet australias needs
1504475 the job prospects for higher degree graduates choosing to focus on a research career are among the most insecure in the country living from three or five year contract to three or five year contract and having to effectively apply for their jobs again one or two years before the contract ends and so on
1504476 some of our best and brightest have among the worst job prospects making a research career unattractive in relation to other options
1504477 it is time to rethink this whole system and assist universities to give job security to those pursuing a research career
1504478 im especially pleased with the way the market is aligning with incentives for adoption of our electronic solutions from the federal government payers and others

1504490 this is a range of 61 7 million to 66 1 million for fy2008 net profit after tax after allowing for one off costs

1504503 we expect asciano to continue to perform well in the 2008 09 financial year
1504504 for the patrick business port volumes are expected to remain robust
1504505 whilst the record levels of volume growth seen over the past five years are unlikely to be repeated in the short term continued growth in imports and ongoing efficiency gains within the business should see further solid earnings growth achieved in 2008 09
1504506 the coal business will continue to benefit from strong demand and high coal prices and we expect to see capacity constraints in the hunter valley network ease during the coming 12 months
1504507 finally the successful restructuring of ascianos grain business during the year will see a substantial recovery in the profit contribution of this business in 2008 09
1504508 the contracts asciano has entered into are unique and set a new benchmark for rail freight services in australia
1504509 asciano will invest a further 200 million to provide additional capacity for future growth
1504510 the patrick ports business continued to benefit from growth in imports particularly for containerised goods and motor vehicles
1504511 pacific national achieved very good operating results in the intermodal business whilst ongoing strong demand for coal was again hampered by ongoing infrastructure capacity constraints
1504512 exports of rural commodities remained soft due to the ongoing effects of the drought
1504513 i saw a big bear on the tree i said oh my gosh it was a big bear
1504514 i was kind of a little scarred but not really scarred
1504515 it climbed higher and higher it was trying to make an alternate route i guess to escape
1504516 i went in the subway sandwich shop and ordered two sandwiches and i paid almost 12 for the sandwich i did not get the sandwich made the way to be made the way i wanted to
1504517 he actually called 911 to tell us that he needed our assistance because his sandwich was improperly made
1504518 they locked the door on me they got the sandwiches i paid for inside the store im not leaving here until i got what i paid for im not going to sit and pay 12 or 10 for some sandwiches and not get what i paid for
1504519 then he calls a third time and wanted to know where police were once we arrived he was totally irrational
1504520 he was obviously having a bad day and he was going to take it out on anybody he could and he verbally took it out on the restaurant and he took it out on us when we went to assist him
1504521 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1504522 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1504523 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1504524 coach mike mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time

1504529 i know the man has been through a lot in some ways yes i was taken aback but in some ways no because hes been through a lot since he has been in the city
1504530 its just an unfortunate situation that happened in the community weve got to get past this
1504531 i feel like if i went to the male bathroom it would bring more crazy reaction than going to a female bathroom
1504532 because hes a man he dont need to be using no womans bathroom
1504533 what if we came in and seen hes standing up instead of sitting down
1504534 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1504535 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1504536 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1504537 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers

1504549 welcome to the fishbowl in here we get a little bit too excited sometimes we get zealous about the bleeding edge we sometimes get tired of things before most of the rest of the internet has even found it and we often crave connections and meaning and value out of these shiny objects
1504550 but dont let people tell you that youre wrong for not liking something
1504551 learn what works try out lots of things and then go with what you end up liking no harm no foul
1504552 that statement folks is the one that would help you make the successful move and transition to adopting social computing and social software tools both within the corporate world and beyond and start enjoying some of the most interesting and exciting conversations there is no need for you to spread thinner than whatever you may well be already just because one or two of your connections are sending you invites to the next shiny object they are trying out it doesnt necessarily mean that you would be jumping next to try it out too it is ok to say that you pass that time around that you are not very much interested on that specific new social tool because it doesnt fulfil specific needs so at that present moment in time there is no reason for you to be there it is ok to say to those connections that you are not going to spread thinner that time around and that you would wait for a little bit for their impressions to then perhaps start with the playing phase once again do what works for you

1504556 decided to test the waters of the xxx market in the usa
1504557 i seem to have a talent for producing quality and am highly respected by many companies worldwide
1504558 this cock ring has something for everyone increased longevity and heightened stimulation for both him and her
1504559 the buzz buddies line will provide retailers with a unique twist on a popular product with a known history of high sell through and customers with an unrivaled experience in designing this product we wanted to create the perfect cock ring one with multiple functions and stimulations
1504560 this campaign was created and designed to better support our distributors by advertising in popular trades that attracts more then 25 000 buyers across europe
1504561 these buyers are the decision makers they are lingerie and adult novelty boutique owners and buyers for big department stores such as galleries lafayette in paris
1504562 this year we will be present in several upscale shows such as the international lingerie show in the united states and venus show in berlin this trade show presence is another way that we support our distributors and their clients
1504563 it turned into sort of a grassroots movement alternative better quality toys
1504564 the beginning was some of the best times of our lives we didnt know just how great the product was soon the living room became too small and we quickly expanded to a warehouse in burbank
1504565 it turned out that the u s market was longing for a different type of erotic toy with a focus on product quality rather than packaging appeal
1504566 so rudy and i took a long shot and decided to give it a chance in spite of all the difficulties with importing from europe
1504567 especially over the last two years i see more and more that our retailers and their customers end consumers are more aware of high quality products they are able to distinguish very much between products which are manufactured in china and ours which are 100 percent manufactured in germany
1504568 the women are the real shoppers if you get them interested in walking into your store women like less offending and pornographic looks in vibrators and dildos bright colors are important as well they have to have a fun inviting and unintimidating look
1504569 it needs to be attractive eye catching practical easy to use and easy to open retailers need to be able to open the box and show the product to the customer in order to not break the box and put it back on the shelf
1504570 europeans are a bit more open and do not get offended that quickly when dealing with sexuality
1504571 i do not understand why we are so prude in the u s when it comes to sexuality
1504572 we have a team that has a strong understanding of the market and communicates the right message
1504573 we consider ourselves part of a modern lifestyle where making love and having sex with or without a partner is part of our daily lives
1504574 this cd was recorded as a tribute to the many musicians that have influenced my playing over the years these are the men that brought me down to the water and baptized me in the blues

1504576 job 3 or 4 with the developers understandable given gits history but not as useful to me sooner or later all projects cross platforms it seems
1504577 always the censors are concerned with how men act and how women are portrayed women cannot make free sexual choices in that world they are too oppressed to know that only oppression would lead them to sell sex and i watching am either too oppressed to know the harm that my watching has done to my sisters or or else i have become the man and it is the man in me who watches and is aroused shame what a mysogynistic worldview this is this claim that women who make such choices cannot be making free choices at all are not free to make a choice feminists against pornography have done a sad and awful thing they have made women into objects
1504578 its a very significant issue and theres certainly a need for system support for schools to deal with it
1504579 your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing with central america really give me cause for great pride in you and thanks get some turkey signed george bush
1504580 ive finally figured out what im doing with my future
1504581 its hard to train when you dont know what your next fight is affliction is a great opportunity to showcase my skills and test myself again
1504582 i fought him to a unanimous decision victory but it was a tough fight and im sure its going to be a tough fight this time but im ready im ready for anybody
1504583 it was good in the sense that i had many fights i had five fights last year and it kind of brought me back into shape
1504584 hopefully its going to lead me to the next level so thats good
1504585 all the confiscated weapons will be made available to investigators
1504586 people on incomes of 300 000 are getting tax breaks of 3000 to enable them to buy private health insurance which they would buy anyway
1504587 then we might return to an equitable health system which doesnt require a healthy credit card just to access proper health care
1504588 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses chairman and chief executive rupert murdoch said
1504589 although we clearly face more challenging macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth mr murdoch said
1504590 he doesnt seem to want to engage in any discourse
1504591 his few responses are non verbal theres very little eye contact occasionally hell nod or shake his head to answer
1504592 ive written much about many different things but dont know how much ive actually said
1504593 vote 110 s con res 21 biden amdt no 529 to increase funding for the cops program to 1 15 billion for fy 2008 to provide state and local law enforcement with critical resources necessary to prevent and respond to violent crime and acts of terrorism and is offset by an unallocated reduction to non defense discretionary spending and or reduction to administrative expenses

1504596 and already were headed to california again for a gaming event ea invited us to their gamers day next week too but we just cant afford to be out of the office that long
1504597 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1504598 it has been a dramatic bull story along with the commodity boom
1504599 the aussies fall is more a function of the rba than the us fed today
1504600 although downside risk to growth remains the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1504601 we dont expect any changes from them until 2009 once the housing market has stabilised
1504602 as to the information the government wanted from richard scrushy ausa assistant u
1504603 during this discussion mr lourie told me that he did not want to take me down a wrong path and that his position was fixed on a plea to misprison of a felony i asked him whether that meant that he would not consider a misdemeanor and he told me that he would discuss it but he did not think he would approve it he told me he would not agree to dismiss the case lourie said based upon the proffer that misprison of a felony was the best fit in terms of a plea and that richard would just have to add a new portion to his proffer that is richard would have to change his statement to the government
1504604 lourie suggested that richard admit that he knew that the governor was committing a crime by demanding that is extorting a contribution that richard should have rejected the governors demands but because he did not richard would admit that he committed a crime mr scrushy rejected any such plea as completely inconsistent with the facts
1504605 he told me that he could not discuss the decision making process any further and that he really should not have shared what he did with me and that he would be in trouble if it were known that he had shared the little information he provided to me
1504606 my client would not agree to plead guilty to misprison of a felony because he did not agree and would not say that he had done anything illegal in his dealings with governor siegelman
1504607 the kind of blog you have to read continuously to understand
1504608 were hoping i could vouch for mr shulers account or at least his general believability
1504609 drawing on experienced actors in the gay adult field as well as interested newcomers boundgods com focuses on the powerful interactions between bondage players creating vignettes that have as much to do with real kinky play as they do with creating an erotic fantasy

1504611 any doctor with an interest in sports medicine knows being an olympic doctor is the ultimate job
1504612 every year after that i decided i would build up my experience to meet all the criteria needed to get the job i firmly believe that if you really set your mind on something you can achieve it
1504613 i was big into swimming and squash at school too
1504614 i was seduced by the hawkes bay i distinctly remember it was minus three degrees when i left england and 30 degrees when i arrived here
1504615 i love new zealands outdoors and being able to go for runs a cycle or a swim
1504616 its not quite a war zone out there but it happens around once a week
1504617 i would says buses and trucks are the worst offenders
1504618 i was a little bit ginger wondering if she had seen me i looked straight at her but she just didnt see she hit my right side and i ended up on her bonnet
1504619 it was a shock i threw my helmet on the ground as hard as i could i picked up my bike and started pacing pedestrians waiting at the lights told me the car had stopped but i didnt want to talk to her i had right of way i had my lights on
1504620 so i dont want to raise the publics expectation that something will be built without them having an understanding of just what those costs are
1504621 just strengthening without a building on top and being able to have ships tied up beside it is about 3 million it has to be a structure that has some way of covering the cost of its construction but also generating income
1504622 we could have a chinese dragon on the other side of the building something relating to maori legend a tibetan lion an indian cow and a room dedicated to the gay community
1504623 anything out there will have to put up with wellingtons occasional inclement days and occasionally the waterfront can be windswept so if you want people to walk out to the outer t i would imagine something that provided shelter would be more attractive to wellington and visitors

1504696 youre not working smart youre not managing your guys in a smart way i dont mean youre being stupid in fact a lot of store managers and even people at corporate fall into this same trap
1504697 what you have to do dom whether youre delegating tasks within a team or the owner of your own business giving employees tasks to do someday is make your assignments smart
1504698 be specific dont tell your guys to clean up this area here tell them to pick up the stock from the floor wipe down the shelves and make sure the price tags are accurate
1504699 but make sure the task you hand out is measurable you want every item on these shelved priced correctly no dirt and grime on these shelves and nothing left on the floor a measurable goal lets you answer the question when am i done with this
1504700 achievable goals are ones that can actually be finished increase computer sales by 30 000 is specific and measurable but not achievable
1504701 an achievable goal should also be reasonable the two dovetail to one another if you have very heavy customer traffic it isnt reasonable to ask your guys to clean and stock a shelf off in the corner and leave customers waiting keep in mind their other obligations

1504721 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time

1504730 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin
1504731 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides
1504732 and thus far found no evidence of an active fire
1504733 you hear from time to time about planes returning to airports because an indicator light went on but its pretty rare that they actually deploy chutes
1504734 thats essentially up to the pilot who makes the call based on the particular circumstance he or she faced
1504735 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1504736 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1504737 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1504738 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1504739 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1504740 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1504741 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1504742 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1504743 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1504744 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1504745 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1504746 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1504747 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1504748 people are saying its woody allens steamiest movie im thinking
1504749 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1504750 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1504751 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1504752 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1504753 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1504754 by having our convention and having it placed early in the day on super tuesday this gave us the opportunity to achieve that
1504755 and so our convention style winner take all majority vote required to win was successful in attracting three of the four candidates
1504756 people like to be with a winner people also reassess whether the first choice is the one that they want to push ahead sometimes thats the way it happens other look at the second choice candidate and say no thats a clearer choice for me i just say thats a not unusual activity to happen in elections like this and frankly i found that had it gone for governor romney or governor huckabee either one of those would not have been unexpected
1504757 west virginia news media are reporting that in exchange for his support huckabee will give paul three of the 18 delegates he secured today
1504758 theres a lot of interest in this election and on both sides of the democratic ticket there are a lot of hillary and barack supporters and theyre going to come out in large numbers and thats a good thing thats a very good thing and i think that will carry through to november as well
1504759 im not a product of washington ive been in d c certainly long enough to see how it works but ive been outside of washington long enough to know how it should work
1504760 anyone can talk about delivering change and everyone is talking about it every politician hes talked about it ive done it
1504761 i cant say ive changed the world but ive certainly taken decisions and created organizations and worked on issues that have tried to make a difference and have actually produced tangible results
1504762 i think theres a big distinction there between someone who talks about it and someone whos actually done it
1504763 when i speak i speak from a very very personal perspective
1504764 and i think that they see that its genuine and sincere and personal and i think they understand thats a good combination and a good way to beat mark kirk
1504765 if i had my druthers i like some of the ideas that would spur business to invest more in research and development and would also go to unemployment insurance or food stamps because that money gets consumed almost immediately it gets put right into the economy
1504766 we have a 9 2 trillion national debt its ok to deficit spend to stimulate the economy but we have to make sure that its temporary so that we dont trade one problem for another
1504767 on a substantive level the economy is starting to rise up to the top
1504768 i hear that a lot i still hear a lot about iraq
1504769 targeted toward people who can use it and reinvest in the economy
1504770 im concerned about our growing deficit and this cant be something that drags on for very long
1504771 the notion of extending unemployment benefits and welfare and food stamp benefits those are all worthy things to explore and those are things that i certainly would be very supportive of
1504772 ive got well over 1 000 contributors and the vast majority of that money is from right here
1504773 i think that makes me a better representative of the district
1504774 this has been such a crazy year i dont think you can rule anything out
1504775 seems on his way to effectively wrapping up the gop nomination on feb 5 if not soon thereafter
1504776 were working hard to cultivate his previous donors and murrays previous donors and donors across the country
1504777 ive been helping people for a long time nothing new about it
1504778 the degree might be different but the principles the same
1504779 a likely use would be to help candidates for office who are running on a constitutionalist platform
1504780 we couldnt be more pleased with the enthusiasm and commitment to this country we saw from kansas voters this evening
1504781 we are grateful to have the support of thousands of people who despite long waits and crowded buildings were committed to making their voices heard
1504782 feel that they are on the ascendency that theyre in sync with the mood of the american people that they have the more attractive candidates and therefore it counts for them to turn out and to help make this decision about who the nominee is going to be
1504783 when people get excited and its competitive they get emotionally connected with a candidate as they have with obama it mobilizes people and they turnout at higher levels
1504784 i dont think marshalls going to win with huge margins i think he wins comfortably this year
1504785 there were a couple of loopholes created i dont think there was anything nefarious
1504786 like a lot of legislation that is radically changing the system there are some kinks that have to be worked out this is one of those situations where nobody envisioned that this wasnt covered
1504787 during the time he has been in office the county has groaned
1504788 new jersey has a very strong tradition of counties being involved in selecting candidates
1504789 if people are going to come together and support one candidate it would mean that three county chairs would have to agree
1504790 the kind of service jim saxton has given us honorable conservative and ethical the kind of service i signed up for when i joined the navy and served during the gulf war
1504791 my strength is that for now im in my 16th year i have represented just about 50 percent of the district i know 50 percent of district and 50 percent of the district know me
1504792 longtime trenton politician whose failed tax spend and borrow policies have made new jersey unaffordable for working families drove businesses out of the state and allowed government corruption to become synonymous with new jersey
1504793 i will fight to bring a responsible end to the war in iraq fight for affordable health care coverage and create better paying jobs
1504794 while the republicans continue to advocate failed bush policies backed by special interest groups i will always put the families in new jersey first and fight to clean up washington
1504795 we were somewhat dispirited at that time coming on the heels of a major loss in 2006
1504796 and i submit to you that a year later our prospects are a lot brighter
1504797 this whole area of fundraising is one that i would point to and say that we are doing well and we will have the money to get our message out
1504798 im not concerned about the turnout numbers theres not a direct correlation between turnout in primaries and who is elected president
1504799 we will have a recommendation for the convention that i think will improve the system going forward
1504800 if you start with the republican party jobs the war and illegal immigration are all at the top of the list there really is no statistical difference between the three then that one is followed by taxes health care is way down the list as is foreign policy the terrorist threat and abortion
1504801 on the democratic side jobs and the economy are way out ahead as the top issues followed by the war and health care which are tied for second more democrats are concerned about jobs and the economy thats actually a change over the last two weeks
1504802 for the entire year voter concerns i think have been piqued by the states consideration of the state health care reform package that was subsequently killed last week therefore voters are more tuned into the health care related issues and more concerned about health care
1504803 there are three sets of issues which get californians interested and excited and one is the environment thats uniquely california second one is immigration
1504804 this is a state that has not been that favorable towards the iraq war in general but i think in a way people are moving on a little bit right now and starting to worry about the economy and health care
1504805 california republicans tend to be more conscious of environmental issues than republicans elsewhere republican gov arnold schwarzenegger is an example of that you dont do well in california if you talk about drilling for oil off the coast or deny the reality of global warming
1504806 like voters everywhere californians are concerned about the economy and national security republicans though actually list illegal immigration as their top policy concern democrats tend to rank health care even higher here than in other parts of the country its an issue thats been building over the last several months that has voters thinking and talking about it more than you might have in other circumstances
1504807 the economy is the issue it is a brooding omnipresence that is hovering over every house and every dinner table and every family in california
1504808 and drivers licenses for undocumented workers takes on particular significance in a state where 20 to 27 percent of democratic turnout will be latino
1504809 we have a very conservative republican base that especially has a voice in the legislature calling for anti immigration policies and every year in the last few election cycles there have been anti immigration propositions on the ballot and they tend to pass with great support 70 plus percent support in some cases
1504810 arizonans particularly in the phoenix area were really hard hit by the mortgage problem so the economy is certainly on the minds of arizonans now arizonas facing a 1 billion shortfall in the budget this year and is projected to have a 1 7 billion shortfall in revenues next year so were moving into an era where government spending is going to be tighter where people are having a difficult time paying their taxes and state revenues seem to be down and tourism seems to be down so they will be looking to candidates to address those issues
1504811 arizona is one of the few states that actually rejected a same sex marriage ballot measure in 2006
1504812 arizonas still kind of if you go back to the barry goldwater days theres still a kind of a strain of western libertarianism thats still alive in arizona even though youve had a lot of growth
1504813 more interested in stopping illegal immigration and border security just because a lot of illegal immigrants come over the border in arizona so it causes problems with a lot of things
1504814 i would think important issues would be pretty similar to what the other ones are nationally iraq war taxes so i dont think were all that different from other parts of the country on basic issues
1504815 colorado has been a dynamic political context recently colorado has shifted its governor state house and senate and the balance of its congressional delegation to the democrats in the last six years so there seems to be momentum for gains by the democratic party in partisan registration and in office holding so it may be that the change theme may be more of a factor than experience in our closed caucuses this year from both parties
1504816 probably the largest difference between colorado and other states is the issue priority of immigration especially among republicans
1504817 still at the end of the day coloradoans are most worried about exactly the same things that the rest of the united states is the war and the economy and just about equally so from the latest data i have seen
1504818 utah basically hates the no child left behind nclb federal education law and have passed resolutions basically saying they hate it a lot of legislators have even said they dont care if they lose funding under nclb
1504819 with a high percentage of land owned by the federal government in utah and with the rural legislators who control the state legislature they hate the bureau of land management and any attempt they try to close lands to wilderness protection they believe the state should control all the lands and roads
1504820 in the state legislature the negative reaction to undocumented workers has reached a fever pitch
1504821 the iraq war issue is one that does not generate a great deal of discussion among people however there is a general feeling that you just dont walk out and that if our troops are there we need to protect them
1504822 there is significant growth in the number of hispanics in southwest utah and that has led to pretty emotional statements between those who want to be tolerant and other who are racist
1504823 the issue landscape does ebb and flow though education has been there for years while people think schools are ok it is the classroom overcrowding the high student teacher ratio that are the problem
1504824 with the large amount of high technology companies and the fact the state is a very attractive place to do business with low taxes and a cheap constant and very intelligent labor force and being a right to work state you get a lot for your dollar as far as labor goes
1504825 gov richardson is embroiled in a fight over his proposed universal health care package with our state legislature so its very much in the news and we have a very high level of an uninsured population in the state
1504826 the continuing war in iraq is very important because we have so many of our families involved in the military with members abroad with members fighting in the war
1504827 in new mexico we tend to not benefit from big booms at the same time we get a bit shielded from the real downward spirals but i would say that the housing bust and the difficulties with families holding onto homes probably does have an impact here
1504828 as a southwestern state we definitely have an immigrant community or an immigrant population but not as much as some of our neighboring states so sure there is a concern over an undocumented population and their rights and their general status but we have some real divergent ideas that probably break down along party lines about what the solutions are
1504829 the economys still closely tied to immigration that the two issues are very interrelated and people are pretty concerned about both of them
1504830 one of the interesting things ive found is when you talk to people like and president george bush and republican sen pete domenici and even arizona democratic gov they talk very similarly about immigration and i think its because theyve all been on the border and theyve seen it on a practical level
1504831 the economys still doing well and the housing market has gone from unsustainable boom to just very strong
1504832 everythings going back to growth in the area because the state is really expanding were getting a lot of people moving in from california because its much less expensive
1504833 most people seem more tied to local growth property taxes roads schools things like that
1504834 especially whats bothering people is with property taxes the assessed values of their home are going up quickly so that causes the property taxes to go up thats probably the biggest complaint that people have with taxes
1504835 a double edged sword here theres one group who you see throughout traditional conservatives who are into close the border and get illegals out of here but this is still a big agricultural area and the crops dont come in without immigrant labor so theres really a strong two sides of it out here even though idahos very conservative the farmers still know they need it so many of them support more whats been described as comprehensive reform whether it be a guest worker program or things like that
1504836 in a lot of communities that growth hasnt paid for itself so thats a big issue
1504837 being part of super tuesday has given our democrats a reason to pay attention so for us its not so much about issues its about engagement people are just we want to win some elections the last time that it was a real horse race was when our own u s senator frank church was running in 1976 its kind of an exciting full circle for us
1504838 were becoming more urbanized in a small city sense our economy has changed in the same fashion
1504839 the fastest growing areas of the interior west are the attractive places
1504840 our growth is being driven mainly by amenities and not extraction of resources and therefore the way in which we view the protection of the environment has switched 180 degrees youve got an economy that 20 years ago protecting the environment was against your economic interest and an economy today protecting the environment is seen as the way to protect future economic prosperity
1504841 this new economy is much more human resource based whereas the old economy was very natural resource based so were kind of moving into a situation where it doesnt matter what party youre in youre for education thats a big change
1504842 people have great affinity for farmers ranchers so people pay attention to stuff like the farm bill and obviously montana democratic sen max baucus is head of the senate finance committee so hes got a new proposal here in terms of whatever the economic stimulus tax rebate plan is here people are watching that
1504843 in other years were no 1 in terms of the percent of young people of military age to enlist so were pretty patriotic so you find somewhat more support for the war than elsewhere but still majority disapproval of the conflict at this point in time one difference there is much stronger support for whats happening in afghanistan than in iraq and i think a lot of that just has to do with casualties as it did in vietnam
1504844 the average republican voter has no say in what happens
1504845 this being a new process for montana this is the first time weve been a part of super tuesday the first time montanans have had a chance to weigh in on the presidential process without being the second to last state voting basically its all kind of new
1504846 alaskans when voting in the national races tend to think about how candidates and policies pertain to us and our development so anwr is right there
1504847 a separate issue of course is the war in iraq alaska is a state that has a large military population and four large military installations and many military dependents
1504848 alaska you need to understand has a cyclical economy so when the rest of the united states is doing poorly were usually doing well we benefit of course from high oil prices the sub prime mortgage crisis did not have much of an impact on housing in alaska i would say the economic circumstance in the state right now is really very good the state has a projected budget surplus this year between three and five billion dollars
1504849 people in this state want drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge oil constitutes 80 to 95 percent of the state general fund it generates the dividend check for every state resident that last fall was 1 650
1504850 economics are a concern but more in the long range in the short run here your pain is our gain but the price of gas and heating fuel is unbelievable
1504851 today i have withdrawn my candidacy for president of the united states
1504852 i hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort jeri and i will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people
1504853 the fact is the ranks arent nearly where they should be part of the problem on both ends is that its a very idiosyncratic process that gets people into positions on the hill and then downtown its pretty closed circles
1504854 the challenge is creating a process by which you open those often closed circles and you create a greater universe of people who are candidates for those positions
1504855 theyre not people who are going into chief of staff positions or high level committee staff
1504856 theyre people who are trying to get a foot in the door
1504857 our goal is to look around leadership and look around committees and not just have to go to one african american one hispanic or one asian american on a committee staff
1504858 a lot of the senior minorities are cognizant of it and they are always trying to influence the ability of other minorities to at least get a foot in the door
1504859 the climate now is good for interest in hiring minorities
1504860 the quality of the debate is enriched when you have diverse points of view
1504861 well judging from what we hear from our readers and friends here national security is still the number one issue the economy is obviously a momentary concern thats risen to the top our feeling is our fortunes are going to ebb and flow and national security issues are forever with us
1504862 georgians are like most americans only more so theyre concerned about terrorists terrorism staying on the offense this is a very patriotic state and a state with a lot of military folks we have fort gordon a signal corps base which has pretty much had a constant role in iraq generally speaking theyve had someone there most of the time families saying goodbye and hello is not lost on us by any means
1504863 i think just socially that georgia is pretty similar to south carolina and alabama no state is just going to follow anothers lead iowa and new hampshire ignored each other i think we have similar sensibilities and certainly is banking on popularity in the southern states to try and resuscitate his candidacy were fiercely independent and nobody likes pollsters or editorial writers telling them how to vote
1504864 right now its the economy weve seen that georgia has a high rate of foreclosures and we have lost two major auto plants ford and gm plants in the last year or so the economic issues are the most important here especially what can be done to improve the economy of the state
1504865 the most pressing local concern now is water the drought has had a significant effect on personal lives and political education most people dont feel like the government has done enough
1504866 we usually see moderate to low turnout it will likely be higher than normal because of the competitiveness in both parties and i think the fact that is doing well is going to increase turnout within the democratic party
1504867 the big theme were looking at is just the split in both parties its more pronounced on the republican side when was in the race he had those votes locked up with his departure while people knew it was happening or likely to happen theres been low turnout on the republican side low so far they were hoping thompson would still be in and did not want to waste votes
1504868 to be strong on social issues is important tennessee went for bush in 2004 social issues are still clearly at the top of their minds we have a blue dog democrat gov were pretty socially conservative when lined up with the rest of democrats
1504869 the big topic throughout last summer and fall was immigration
1504870 in terms of the economy it hasnt been as bad here in nashville in particular weve got a wide array industries iraq remains a big issue among people especially with kentuckys fort campbell so close its traditionally a top issue
1504871 tennessee is not completely a swing state but without having to register parties and so its election cycle by election cycle i dont think its strictly partisan
1504872 we have african american voters more than the national average which makes the democrat race different
1504873 i think it looks clear african americans will go for obama will it be 80 20 like in south carolina probably not but 70 30 is a big split especially when talking about one quarter of the voting public
1504874 we have the same issues as nationally the economy and iraq i think there is just the fear of a recession immigration is somewhat of an issue here
1504875 support for the iraq war is higher here than it is in other areas in the country but people who vote democratic in alabama are probably as anti war as the rest of the democrats
1504876 there is large military contingent here on the republican side there is a concern on national security issues terrorism and winning the war on iraq
1504877 we have an awful lot of hispanic immigrants legal or not throughout the state voters are having the same issues as other points of the country
1504878 you still have a lot of poor people and people living on the edge health care and gas prices are issues a fairly large part of the population doesnt have health insurance and that is a big problem among the working poor
1504879 we are about to start the legislative session on the same day as the election we are facing an 800 million deficit
1504880 the republicans voters are feeling more on the fight against terrorism and safety and democrats are speaking more about bringing the troops home
1504881 according to our most recent oklahoma poll completed last month oklahomans are concerned about illegal immigration and education in the history of our poll it was the first time since mid 2004 that education was not by itself in first place
1504882 last years oklahoma legislature passed legislation that is perhaps the nations most restrictive when it comes to state services provided for illegal immigrants it also puts pressure on businesses to make sure that all of their employees are in this country legally we have found that among registered voters this was a very popular piece of legislation
1504883 oklahomans worry about the economy like people do around the country but the fallout from sub prime lending and higher fuel prices is not as deep as it is in other states much of the growth of oklahomas economy comes from oil and natural gas and right now things are pretty good compared to other places particularly in the oklahoma city and tulsa areas
1504884 things would turn for the worse in oklahoma if congress this year levied punitive taxes on the energy industry like a windfall profits tax oklahomans want presidential candidates who understand the economics of energy not just fossil fuels but all sources of energy
1504885 were pro military and thats due to the fact we have sizable military outposts here therefore having a fairly strong defense posture is important in both parties
1504886 presidential elections have traditionally been a non event in the state of oklahoma our primaries have traditionally been well after nominees were determined and were a state where the republican usually carries the general election easily so until recently weve never really seen any campaigning four years ago in a competitive democratic primary was first time people here cast meaningful votes for president so we find being actively involved in the presidential primary as a novelty
1504887 there are three issues that just sort of shift position every year the economy education and health care
1504888 the 2006 elections were just a drubbing for the republicans we have a really demoralized and divided republican party here right now
1504889 high wire from the back roads to the beltway the education of bill clinton
1504890 i think like everywhere else the economy is at this moment the chief concern but arkansas tends to be somewhat insulated from national economic indicators the sub prime mortgage crises arent felt as strongly here nearly so as they are in other places the vote tuesday on both sides comes down to the fact that theres a favorite son on one side and favorite daughter on the other
1504891 theres a great deal of good will here for bill clinton and she receives that good will because of him when you ask what people want people in arkansas wouldnt mind bill clinton back in the white house i imagine
1504892 there are a lot of farmers in east arkansas rice soy cotton and they went with and they now regret it
1504893 on voters minds is probably an emphasis on food and family and service so number one is the economy even though the state is doing its best it has in decades were a state thats always worried about the economy given our profile
1504894 were too north of the bible belt to really call it the bible belt but we have a value focus on that and also we have one of the highest proportions of individuals who have military service but i think the economy would still take precedence over values and you cant underestimate the power of military
1504895 the state ranks as one of the lowest in terms of per capita income its a small state and is at an economic disadvantage for that reason then the economy becomes important but this is probably the best economy the state has had in the past 10 years part of that is just because of the price of coal and natural gas so the concern is for the economy but the facts are pretty positive about the economy but given this kind of political landscape the economy is always on peoples minds even when times are better we still worry about it
1504896 its not a good idea to be responding to every single movement in the economy
1504897 you want a plan that works well in different circumstances
1504898 keeping to the basic strategy is important for confidence and basic understanding
1504899 i am concerned about financial market events but with the right leadership and pro growth policies the economy can weather this upheaval
1504900 its important that we take very aggressive action to turn the market away from a recession to turn our nation away from a recession thats why ive proposed a very bold economic stimulus plan
1504901 most of the new ideas offered to stimulate the economy during recessions are often bad ideas that either wont make a difference or would worsen the economy
1504902 i applaud candidates who acknowledge that government doesnt have a magic wand to create growth on a moments notice
1504903 the biggest trap to fall into is that something you developed in another context for different reasons will help solve the problem
1504904 whats good and bad for the economy can be completely opposite depending on how the economy is doing
1504905 its sort of a bad time to ask for complete consistency at a time when you need to develop new ideas
1504906 congress is rushing to compromise with him but i have no idea why hes wrong they ought to send him the right kind of stimulus bill and dare him to veto it
1504907 the meeting that i understand is going to take place today with respect to a stimulus package must produce an agreement that can be quickly passed i have been advocating for some time a package of actions
1504908 this isnt an issue i found along the campaign trail i introduced legislation to stop mortgage fraud and predatory lending almost two years ago i called for a middle class tax cut back in september that would put money into the pockets of over 90 of working americans that would eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than 50 000 that would give a tax credit to struggling homeowners
1504909 thats why when i announced my economic stimulus package the other week i called for immediate tax relief for working families and seniors because they shouldnt have to wait another day for washington to act they need our help right now
1504910 there is little doubt that they will continue to talk about and possibly alter their respective plans so long as the nations economic problems remain on the forefront of voters minds
1504911 the congressman explained that it was a decision that he has been laboring over the past couple of days and that sort of explained the last minute decision here
1504912 we have been monitoring the situation closely and we were able to successfully recruit sen brett guthrie to run
1504913 he is truly an a candidate and we welcome his candidacy into the race
1504914 two credible challengers who reflect the values of the district and voters desire for change
1504915 you clinton were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at wal mart
1504916 let me finish because lord knows you let them go on forever
1504917 south carolina has been devastated by nafta and trade deals
1504918 has really been focused a lot on race as we move down to south carolina
1504919 race is a factor in our society theres no doubt that in a race where youve got an african american and a woman and and john
1504920 after a great deal of thought and prayer and with the knowing that weve achieved virtually everything i set out to accomplish and more i will not seek a second term in the upcoming election
1504921 my campaign for governor has always been about moving missouri forward
1504922 i will continue to focus on changing the direction of our state so that more missourians have access to health care more missourians can find good paying jobs and more missouri children can get the quality education they deserve
1504923 its pretty obvious now that no person can win the nomination of our party unless he or she is both financially and organizationally prepared to conduct a campaign in half of the country simultaneously that is not good
1504924 what im hoping is that this body will make a decision on this issue in april
1504925 we can in a vacuum in this room vote out a plan but getting 50 state legislatures to follow it is a whole other question
1504926 the demographics are in our favor and as such the field of candidates is one of the strongest that weve seen in the history of the district for republicans
1504927 whoever makes it out of the primary is obviously going to be a strong candidate in the general
1504928 i dont believe the current leadership in congress represents mississippis values
1504929 im going to make sure that our values are not compromised or forgotten
1504930 i cannot and will not allow hard working and honest middle class taxpayers to be burdened with this tax liability that was never intended for them
1504931 im not sure that anybody had a lot at risk
1504932 i assume they will do it again at the last minute and that the last minute will come sooner because of the election
1504933 i am a team player and i do what my members want me to do
1504934 we are not about to say youre time has come we need fresh blood
1504935 a new broom may sweep cleaner but brother the old one knows the corners we need someone who knows the corners
1504936 if you dont support him our future could be up in the air
1504937 sometimes our members are supportive of other candidates and that organization is a democratic one
1504938 a group headquartered in new york city and allies of ms edwards has invested in a massive media campaign of distortions and outright lies about congressman albert wynn
1504939 give keynote speeches and participate in panels during overnight and two day visits
1504940 im sorry about it and it was mine to lose i believe
1504941 there are as many reasons to do it as not to do it
1504942 it is a big district and it will be an expensive race
1504943 lets face it thats not the best way to spend an entire calendar year
1504944 my wife julie and i have made this decision after much prayer and deliberation it was not my initial intent to retire and i fully expected and planned to run again right up until very recently
1504945 but it distilled upon us that we were ready for a change after spending almost our entire married lives with me in public service we are at peace with this choice and look forward to starting a new chapter in our lives
1504946 i believe john did the right thing today for his family for the 4th district and for america
1504947 now is the time to unite as americans heal our wounds and move forward to solve the many difficult challenges we face both here in cd4 and across the country we love
1504948 iowa and new hampshire have had a gun pointed at the head of our national party for decades
1504949 one way or another the ice is going to break based on the events of this month
1504950 in this month in this year two key states took on new hampshire and iowa this is the first major step in changing this screwed up process that gives two states such a dominant role in the nomination process
1504951 it is so important to the democratic candidate that they cannot afford not to seat us theyre not going to start the fall campaign by refusing to seat the michigan delegation at the democratic national convention
1504952 i believe we will be seated even if theres a floor fight
1504953 it was about reminding them of what was at stake in this election
1504954 it is probably more likely that we are playing in the feb 5 states than the earlier states
1504955 we are hitting a point where this is not a state but state strategy but a delegates strategy it is a dramatically more complicated strategic set of calculations that have to be made
1504956 you really have to sit there and furrow your brow and say where can i win and where can i lose and how many delegates are available in this media market
1504957 sen obama did an astonishing job of adding younger voters and independents to the process
1504958 from the results tonight we know theres not going to be any premature coronation this race is going to go on and on and on as we go west this fight goes on
1504959 he is an old friend and has showed great courage
1504960 we dont agree on 100 percent of all issues but his commitment on environmental issues and to the chesapeake bay is very important
1504961 if the conservative members of the republican party start purging members who they dont agree with we will be a permanent minority for a long time
1504962 wayne was a very strong supporter of my unsuccessful 2006 senate campaign and his team helped with some of the environmental issues related to the bay and its good to return the favor
1504963 wayne is desperate and part of the d c establishment getting gingrich shows that washington insiders want to protect one of their own they dont want change that 1st congressional district residents are clamoring for
1504964 while we respect the hard work of newt gingrich this is just business as usual in washington d c this is why ej is in the race congress is out of touch with the people michael steele has assured us personally that he is not endorsing anyone in this race and has agreed to introduce someone at an event for us as well
1504965 whose more liberal gilchrest or pipkin then explains how gilchrest voted with house speaker d calif
1504966 we will be a permanent minority for a long time
1504967 she did an outstanding job give her a big round of applause
1504968 no one ever lost money underestimating the intelligence or the gullibility of the new hampshire electorate
1504969 i think they could have shown a lot more courage and a lot more backbone
1504970 i think with more members who are voting the interests of their constituents on this issue we might see more significant progress
1504971 not only would i have not voted for bushs resolution to go to war in iraq i was actively opposing intervention at that point
1504972 the word free and i put that in quotes is an inaccurate description of whats happening where we have treaties that offer no protection for our own jobs
1504973 workers are seeing their jobs head overseas left and right thanks to these trade treaties and there are minimal environmental protections and minimal worker safety issues
1504974 just two of many many issues that we disagree on
1504975 well take an aggressive approach reminding all the families in our district about leonard boswells priorities fighting for everyday working families making health care more affordable promoting a modern day energy policy that works for iowans and making sure our returning veterans receive the proper care they deserve
1504976 68 percent of those participating in the democratic caucuses want change
1504977 i think the time has finally arrived when those issues are going somewhere and the public is ready to see those issues become top priorities and see candidates who have made a lifelong commitment to those issues
1504978 by the time i get to vote in pa there will be no choice left
1504979 over the last week i listened to you and in the process i found my own voice
1504980 the intensity and accessibility that you saw in new hampshire is what youre going to see of hillary all through the rest of the campaign
1504981 obviously theres a lot of ground that has to be covered but the kind of open accessible style that you saw in new hampshire is one that hillary is determined to continue
1504982 our messages going to be the same its always been
1504983 theyre claiming that they knew that this was going to happen get real they were as shocked as anybody
1504984 you cant have two stories that it was both strategic and spontaneous
1504985 the stars are aligning for mccain even here in michigan
1504986 my guess is huckabee will be the third place but the real question is where in third does he show up
1504987 huckabee is going to do better than a lot of people believe here
1504988 i think it is certainly fair to say that we enjoyed a significant advantage with female voters in new hampshire in a way that we did not have in iowa
1504989 and that obviously was a key difference between the results in iowa and the results in new hampshire
1504990 she went into new hampshire and starting with the debate on saturday night in really laying out the choice between her and the rest of the field as talk versus action moran said adding that clinton projected herself as the candidate
1504991 when she showed her passion about how much the race means to the country and the stakes for the country was secondary but important because it allowed voters the opportunity to relate to her and see how much she cares about this as a person
1504992 whether it was that one moment or whether it was other things i cant say
1504993 i think all of a sudden you saw a different side of clinton
1504994 if youre looking for explanations about why the polls were wrong you have to include the clinton organization it does help to have the institutional players behind you
1504995 she has it some places but not others coming up
1504996 deserves a primary process that requires candidates to address the issues they will be held accountable for in the general election
1504997 the january 15th primary in michigan accomplishes precisely this goal
1504998 weve done nothing to encourage cross over voting as a matter of fact weve explicitly discouraged it
1504999 i think theres some reluctance on people who are democrats to say can i have a republican ballot
1505000 together lets give america the kind of comeback that new hampshire has given me
1505001 for all the ups and down of this campaign you helped remind everyone that politics is not a game this campaign is about people
1505002 a few weeks ago no one imagined that wed have accomplished what we did here tonight in new hampshire
1505003 for most of this campaign we were far behind we always knew our climb would be steep but in record numbers you came out and you spoke up for change and with your voices and your votes you made it clear that at this moment in this election there is something happening in america
1505004 i want to be absolutely clear to all of you whove been devoted to this cause and i want to be clear to the 99 percent who have not had their voices heard that i am in this race
1505005 i am in this race until we have actually restored the american dream and strengthened and restored the middle class of america
1505006 im past the age where i can claim the noun kid no matter what adjective precedes this
1505007 but tonight we sure showed them what a comeback looks like
1505008 nobody can buy an election in the state of new hampshire
1505009 well another silver id rather have a gold but i got another silver
1505010 i believe that its time to send somebody to washington who will actually get the job done i dont think its going to get done by washington insiders
1505011 i think you have to have somebody from outside washington who has proven that he can get the job done in one setting after another
1505012 this is a kickoff of whats going to be a very long and very tough game
1505013 and by the time its over with on feb 5 its going to be clear that were the nominee of the party
1505014 tonight youve given us so much more than we could have imagined just a few days or weeks ago
1505015 in the past few days weve seen that momentum build we just sensed that we were going to do better than a lot of people thought this ol southern boy could possibly do up here in new england
1505016 from the results tonight we know theres not going to be any premature coronation this race is going to go on and on and on
1505017 as the first test of the hispanic and western vote the nevada caucus will play an important role in selecting a nominee that can win in the west which will be key to winning the white house in 2008
1505018 our whole motivation here was to increase participation and access the opportunity to participate and thats why we created these caucuses
1505019 mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he wont tell you i just did
1505020 given the immediate and strong interest of other candidates to consider the race i feel this clarity from my campaign will allow the party to have the opportunity to nominate a strong viable candidate
1505021 he led in all the polls in michigan all during 2007 by a wide margin
1505022 but after he pretty much pulled out of iowa and bailed out of new hampshire he just basically pulled out of michigan
1505023 i took an oath to serve and it is an honor to serve my country in the u s army reserves
1505024 although there will be sacrifices to make when called i will gladly serve
1505025 i thought id at least keep all options open until we could have a chance to talk to other folks and make a decision about whats the best thing to do
1505026 i certainly want to be a team player i didnt want to bow out and not have anybody have the option of being there
1505027 until i know more from the army or know if someone else is going to get in the race i figured it would be best just to leave all options open
1505028 thats part of the process ill be going through from now until then trying to get as much information as i can from the army trying to have as many productive discussions with folks here locally in the party and with the nrcc national republican congressional committee and just make a decision about whats best to do
1505029 i certainly will make a decision between now and the 29th but theres still a lot to be discussed and worked out between now and then
1505030 no way i would get into the race unless i could win
1505031 lifetime of fighting the tough fights for change and standing up with courage and conviction and hell keep doing that in the united states senate
1505032 so he can continue fighting to change washington from ending the war in iraq combating global climate change and achieving energy independence to providing universal health care in america
1505033 dont do it in a presidential election year turnout is going to be huge
1505034 single payer tax supported not for profit true universal health care
1505035 hr 676 for church goers less money to insur companies and more to the church lots more srs on medicare save way over 100 wk because no more medigap long term care amp dental insur needed no more drug bills
1505036 when i set the special u s senate election for november 4 2008 i felt very strongly that it was the legal and appropriate action under the u s and mississippi constitutions and state law
1505037 nothing in this decision by the hinds county circuit court changes that belief as i have said all along the final decision in this case will be made by the mississippi supreme court and i look forward to that decision
1505038 theres a sharp contrast between charlie and rico oller between patriotism and partisanship between duty to country and the district and political opportunism
1505039 if any democrat can carry that district browns the kind that can
1505040 your voices matter and as president hillary clinton will not only keep listening but will make sure your voice is always heard
1505041 its been painful and disappointing i dont want to minimize that but i think we have expanded the national debate about reforming the system
1505042 im hoping that because of what weve done this campaign season that by 2012 well have reform and no state will be guaranteed the right of always going first
1505043 tonight is a victory of optimism over washington style pessimism
1505044 but we have no cause to be discouraged or to second guess what we might have done differently we did what we always try to do we went to michigan and told people the truth
1505045 michigan has set the stage for the rest of the gop contests across the country
1505046 ensure that michigan will be a key battleground state in the general elections
1505047 im past the age where i can claim the noun kid no matter what adjective precedes this
1505048 but tonight we sure showed them what a comeback looks like
1505049 when they asked how you going to do that youre down in the polls i answered im going to go to new hampshire and im going to tell people the truth
1505050 we both have exuberant and sometimes uncontrollable supporters we need to get this campaign where it should be
1505051 i know that sen obama and i share a very strong commitment to making sure that this campaign is about us as individuals
1505052 as hillary said our supporters out staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
1505053 it is my responsibility to make sure that were setting a clear tone in our campaign
1505054 what happens is if youve got a mid level executive at a drug company or an insurance company who is inspired by my message of change and they send me money then thats recorded as money from the drug or the insurance industry even though its not organized coordinated or in any way subject to the problems that you see when lobbyists are giving money
1505055 youve got unity in the democratic party on this i have opposed this war consistently
1505056 john are you saying that youre i dont know if im using my question here
1505057 i gotta be careful instead of phrasing it that way
1505058 two seconds before i need it because i will lose it
1505059 powerful emotional response to pain that i see around me
1505060 i feel that in a really personal way and in a very emotional way and i think sometimes that can undermine what you need to do
1505061 dont seem to understand that we can do so much more to help each other
1505062 i get very concerned about pushing further and faster than perhaps people are ready to go
1505063 i will end the notion of yucca mountain because it has not been based on the sort of sound science that can assure the people of nevada that theyre going to be safe
1505064 revealed that this thing does not make sense is not good for the people of nevada and its not good for america
1505065 i also am a political realist and i understand that the political winds are very powerful against doing enough to try to get guns off the street get them out of the hands of young people
1505066 democrats used to be out front for registration and licensing of guns it now appears that theres a recognition that its hard to win a national election with that position is that fair
1505067 during my tenure it was a privilege to have served on the house financial services committee and to work with my colleagues to ensure the health of our nations financial system i have come to appreciate greatly the vital role played by the alternative investment industry in our economy and the importance of its continued success to the competitiveness of our nations capital markets
1505068 we spend 10 billion a month in a senseless war in iraq and yet we could spend 10 billion a year and make sure that every child in america had heath insurance
1505069 the largest shift came in democratic voters views of the candidate who has the best chance of beating the republican in november obama jumped by 19 points on this dimension between the two polls while clinton fell by 13 points
1505070 theres nothing that says i have to enforce unconstitutional laws
1505071 theres an islamic terrorism threat against us its an existential threat it has nothing to do with our foreign policy
1505072 you can find the income tax and the federal reserve here
1505073 the new hampshire way the airwaves dont belong to the media
1505074 theres an islamic terrorism threat against us its an existential threat it has nothing to do with our foreign policy
1505075 we will take over the united states without firing a shot your children will live under communism
1505076 my defining principle that i thought governed everything is that
1505077 as weve said we needed to do well in iowa and that will make a bridge to south carolina
1505078 each campaign has its own priorities and its own strategy for winning the nomination
1505079 theyre very thin and shiny and our machines cant handle them
1505080 were almost playing games you try to guess the right three people who are going to have their ads
1505081 in the interest of our country we do it with pleasure
1505082 that was a pretty big visibility opportunity for him to stand up on central campus in the middle of a busy school day and thousands of students showed up for him to speak
1505083 one or two caucus goers really makes a big difference in terms of how many delegates get assigned
1505084 young voters turned out for candidates who spoke to them talked about the issues they care about and asked for their votes
1505085 i think it says theres something exciting going on there are a lot of younger youthful candidates and theyre drawing a lot of younger voters out
1505086 coming into new hampshire has the cool wind from his iowa win at his back hes climbed four points overnight hillary clinton has dropped one and o mentum is in the air
1505087 its impressive that its on here youd expect the football games to be on
1505088 we need to be prepared for a convention where we have to outstrategize the best politician in the world and thats bill clinton
1505089 after listening to her today id think seriously about voting for her
1505090 she may be a more rounded candidate than he is
1505091 itll be hard to work tomorrow when the new york giants are playing
1505092 we are prepared for things that may go wrong tomorrow
1505093 this turnout is more along the lines of a general election
1505094 this state conducts more recounts than any other state in the country
1505095 ill vote against the democrats when i think theyre wrong and ill vote with the republicans when i think its best for mississippi
1505096 but the most important thing is this if were going to get this country back on sound footing well need a senator who knows how to say no
1505097 saying that everyone else does it isnt good enough anymore
1505098 it is with great pride understanding and acceptance that i am ending my campaign for president of the united states
1505099 from the results tonight we know theres not going to be any premature coronation this race is going to go on and on and on as we go west this fight goes on
1505100 i led the largest squadron in the united states navy not for profit but for patriotism
1505101 i know how to get him i will get him by giving us human intelligence capability and by making it the top priority of our government agencies
1505102 wed be talking about more tax cuts today but we let spending get out of control we have allowed us to betray some of the principles of the republican party
1505103 we took a 200 million dollar deficit and turned it into an 850 million dollar surplus
1505104 the overall tax burden on new yorkers was reduced 17 percent by the time i left office
1505105 change is a slogan and the examination has to be is it change for good or is it change for bad
1505106 we had some votes in iowa and everybody came out talking about change
1505107 i have the only plan of anyone dealing with social security at this table
1505108 you know mike you make up facts faster than you talk and thats saying something
1505109 i think we ought to move to a flatter tax
1505110 we all love ronald reagan we want to be like him but even ronald reagan made mistakes
1505111 i believe one of my strengths is being able to work with people and i think washington is very broken in this regard we need to move away from partisanship to finding solutions to our problems
1505112 he had the machinery of a campaign up and going and was skirting that law for the bulk of the fall
1505113 the fundraising component was an important piece of that and arizona law allows you to explore office in that way
1505114 its curious to me that they categorize state legislators as the only people who cant do their job and run for another office
1505115 rural arizona is part of me and who i am and i believe i am uniquely capable of speaking for our community and our needs and our concerns
1505116 youll make a terrific terrific addition to the arizona delegation and a terrific congresswoman
1505117 thats a seat that were very confident were going to retain no matter who our nominee is
1505118 just because bob lord has a lot of money to kick around in congressional district 3 doesnt mean that he can buy a congressional district
1505119 people across the country are placing their faith in our campaign especially those hardest hit by the recent downturn in the economy we cant let them down were working together to bring about change and america is responding to our efforts
1505120 and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1505121 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1505122 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1505123 helps to preserve the american dream that any persons son or daughter can grow up to be president that theres a place that you dont have to have the most money or the most fame
1505124 i know theres been a lot of reports out there about our delegation not being seated at the national convention but i have every confidence that our delegations going to be seated and those delegates will be elected based on the results of our primary
1505125 you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink
1505126 we have a number of people who were raised by the state
1505127 you know what we get from the city and the state we get the health inspector we dont get money
1505128 they can say it but i want to see it done
1505129 ive been fighting with the va for the last four years
1505130 lucky to be able to get to a burger joint and get a burger
1505131 id like to put some of these candidates in a bag in a snow bank for two weeks
1505132 i think hes fresh i think hes sincere i think hes loved by the rest of the world
1505133 i think its imperative that any actionable intelligence that would lead to a strike be given the most careful consideration
1505134 obviously making change is not about what you believe its not about a speech you made its about working hard
1505135 ive been in hostage negotiations that are more civil than this
1505136 this race is wide open and we will continue to run a national primary campaign designed to win the number of delegates necessary to become the republican nominee
1505137 i always knew this endeavor would be an uphill battle against very tough odds
1505138 we never were trying to compete with iowa or new hampshire we just wanted our grass roots rank and file members to be able to have some meaningful meetings with these candidates
1505139 i think generally ill be an independent but for the purposes of this
1505140 i know there is a little group of undecideds back there you guys are going to be like red meat in a tiger pit
1505141 there are twelve of us where are we going to go
1505142 my feeling is one candidate needs to be stopped here and that is hillary
1505143 not that i have any problem with hillary personally but i think she has the biggest chance to lose
1505144 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1505145 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world

1505147 thank you south carolina for bringing us across the finish line in the first in the south primary it took us a while but whats eight years among friends
1505148 we have a ways to go and some tough contests ahead starting tomorrow in the state of florida where we are going to win
1505149 were well on our way tonight and we feel good about the challenge
1505150 as pleased as we are about results im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to keep america safe prosperous and proud im running to restore the trust of the american people in their government im running so our children and their children will have the opportunities were blessed with im running so that they will have the same sublime honor as i have had to be proud to be an american
1505151 the path to the white house is not ending here tonight
1505152 we are resetting the clock we have learned and tomorrow after a little bit of sleep we wake up to fight the battle yet again and yet again and i still believe a year from now all of you that have helped us get there will be in washington for the inauguration of the 44th president of the united states
1505153 and have done it with honor than to have won with the dishonor of attacking somebody else
1505154 i think that the lesson of this election in iowa is that one you cant buy an election in iowa and two that negative campaigns dont work
1505155 they dont work there and they dont work here in new hampshire theyre not going to work
1505156 you win the silver in one event it doesnt mean youre not going to come back and win the gold in the final event and that were going to do
1505157 ran a largely positive campaign that should be a lesson to all of us here
1505158 given ron paul s support in new hampshire and his recent historic fundraising success it is outrageous that dr paul would be excluded
1505159 it raises the possibility that this is an ideological decision
1505160 is he being excluded because hes not taking what fox believes are appropriate republican positions since its difficult to figure out what other criteria might be at play
1505161 the network said it had limited space in its studio a souped up bus and that it invited candidates who had received double digit support in recent polls
1505162 the party is not excluding anyone and we are in ongoing discussions with fox to have all candidates be given an opportunity to participate
1505163 the media is chomping at the bit to vote someone off the island and i understand that reporters who have been covering the race closely for 12 months are tired and ready to move on to the playoffs but the regular season isnt over yet and we dont stop the baseball or the football season with a month to go just because its apparent whos going to make the playoffs
1505164 its not my job to be defending democrats but it is part of my job to defend the first in the nation primary how can you cut out people who have been in the u s senate for the better part of three decades
1505165 until voters have actually cast votes or participated in the caucus in iowa and new hampshire it is completely wrong and inappropriate to shut off debate its premature and its wrong
1505166 there have been plenty of debates you could say the alternative voices have been heard
1505167 on this january night at this defining moment in history you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
1505168 most of the pundits believe that when youre outspent at least 15 to 1 its simply impossible to overcome that mountain of money and somehow garner the level of support thats necessary to win an election
1505169 tonight we proved that american politics still is in the hands of ordinary folks like you and tonight i hope we will forever change the way americans look at their political system and how we elect presidents and elected officials
1505170 his consistent conservative record and straight talk on the tough issues is resonating granite state voters
1505171 you can spend your whole fortune on these attack ads but it still wont be true
1505172 we disagree on a lot of issues but i agree you are the candidate of change
1505173 ron you need a thorough understanding of what radical jihad is
1505174 i think we also ought to recognize that what sen obama has done is to touch at the core of something americans want
1505175 every time we swipe our credit card at the gas pump we might as well be sending a check over to the madrassas that are training the terrorists that are eventually going to come back to us
1505176 we have a rudy giuliani who supports the presidents plan on iraq we have governor mitt romney who also supports a troop surge how are you different from any of those candidates
1505177 well im not sure that i support the troop surge if that surge has to come from our guard and reserve troops which have really been overly stretched
1505178 i do not support and have never supported a timed withdrawal from iraq
1505179 former massachusetts gov mitt romney on wednesday endorsed setting timetables and milestones for iraq policy but keeping them private an approach notably supported by democratic sen mark pryor ark
1505180 recently the u s senate failed the american people by blocking progress on immigration reform for the second time in two years
1505181 we cannot put this off any longer the ongoing problems with our immigration system are dividing our country and distracting us from the work we need to do in other important areas such as health care education and jobs
1505182 huckabee did well among republican voters who had lower incomes
1505183 in the coming days we will take a hard look at the challenges this district faces in filling the shoes of congressman lantos but today is not the day to be thinking about future political office
1505184 congressman lantos has overcome many hurdles in his life and i hope and pray hell overcome this one
1505185 it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti nazi underground could have received an education raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress
1505186 i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country
1505187 i actually voted for the 87 billion before i voted against it
1505188 today youre seeing the amt applied to people who no longer are your ultra high income
1505189 told me that he was frustrated that edwards was not out campaigning harder
1505190 i also heard that kerry believed edwards had promised him that if kerry wanted to run again in 2008 edwards would sit the race out
1505191 but if you asked the edwards people about it they said there was no way any such promise had been made
1505192 we cant nice these people to death they have billions of dollars at stake
1505193 i think his track record of doing things for the little people is important
1505194 at first i wasnt sold on him tonight i am
1505195 i literally was sobbing i knew right then i had to support him
1505196 i do not believe washington can be transformed from within by lifelong politicians
1505197 there have been too many deals too many favors too many entanglements and too little real world experience managing guiding leading
1505198 its what our country needs it is what our people deserve
1505199 im not embarrassed to admit that i think most of us learn with experience i know i certainly have
1505200 i get tired of people that are holier than thou because theyve been pro life longer than i have
1505201 are as american as youll find anywhere in the country
1505202 then i was a road warrior and a stump speaker at county fairs
1505203 we recognized that there was no way i was going to beat him
1505204 a republican white male mormon millionaire in massachusetts had no credible chance even when the campaign was riding high i never put our odds better than one out of ten
1505205 my parents are at that age that i want to make sure theres something going on for them
1505206 april blood 35 said she voted democratic for new york sen hillary clinton in part because she knew her favorite candidate texas rep ron paul would not win
1505207 you come out not just to cheer but to challenge
1505208 theres no one ive talked to who doesnt like him
1505209 i wished he obama wouldve gone into how he would have made changes
1505210 im not probably going to drive more than an hour from home to hear anyone speak
1505211 politics is sloppy no matter what no matter what obama says
1505212 i dont believe in criticizing the other party who was in power before 9 11
1505213 well weve only had two little primaries so far so its pretty premature to decide which one is going to be the candidate
1505214 proud to have been a member of the reagan revolution a foot soldier
1505215 i was a part of it in 1979 and a lot of the evangelicals who became a part of helping ronald reagan to be elected
1505216 a wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband
1505217 im not the least bit ashamed of my faith or the doctrines of it i dont try to impose that as a governor and i wouldnt impose it as a president but i certainly am going to practice it unashamedly whether im a president or whether im not a president
1505218 oh my goodness go against the poll how could anybody ever do that
1505219 and the first place you can tell that the news is good coming out of iraq is because you read so little about it in the new york times
1505220 i know how to bring change and i will change washington
1505221 i will take it apart and put it back together simpler smaller smarter
1505222 i would say heath better come talk to me about it
1505223 the most effective immigration enforcement policy we can offer our country is one that considers all parts of this equation
1505224 it looked like he grabbed my strive bill took all the enforcement parts of it and forgot to turn the page its a book he didnt finish reading
1505225 of the 24 hispanic members of the house only ciro d rodriguez d texas has signed onto shulers bill
1505226 i ran the campaign exactly the way i wanted to and at this point not being able to gain traction in conservative states of nevada and south carolina its time to allow our volunteers and supporters to focus on the campaigns that remain viable
1505227 today the people of nevada voted for change in washington i am ready to get my hands on washington and turn it inside out
1505228 we need a space for experimentation where we can test the limits of old laws and explore how they might be altered in future but once isps decide that they are no longer neutral carriers of bits and choose to ally themselves with the content industry then we lose another sliver of freedom
1505229 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1505230 global attainment of the health related mdgs will depend in no small part on indias achievements in improving health nutrition water and sanitation education and child protection gender equality and womens empowerment in the coming years
1505231 the is 50 per cent higher in rural areas than in urban locations
1505232 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1505233 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1505234 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1505235 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
1505236 we were accused of being a racist campaign and it was very painful personally and politically for a lot of people
1505237 people feel they lost the primary in some fashion due to that and so there arent a lot of people rushing to inoculate obama on that account
1505238 if we dont do right by him it hurts her
1505239 is an asset to our campaign and we look forward to his continued support and help in the fall
1505240 as an african american i find his tone and his words to be very depressing
1505241 you wont see new spyborgs assets for several more months
1505242 were refining it considerably pretty much as significant an overhaul as
1505243 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1505244 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1505245 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant
1505246 all we have in life is ourselves and what we can put out there every day for the world to see me is all i got
1505247 three key qualities essential to strong performance as an officer
1505248 i do not have any idea what gwb is like
1505249 the plaintiffs could no longer meet their burden of showing that the case could proceed on the proposed class basis
1505250 the returns on it will be well worth any investment
1505251 we think this is a much needed program both for the intrinsic worth of its education offering but also in helping the state recruit business and industry this is a signature step for a state to say that if you want to go beyond 12th grade you wont be able to say i dont have the money
1505252 by keeping ninth graders in junior high school the change will increase the ninth grade passing rate and improve curriculum
1505253 jailing juveniles the dangers of incarcerating youth in adult jails in america
1505254 there are serious behavioral and emotional problems with many foster children and we want to make sure they are medicated appropriately these are our troubled children
1505255 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1505256 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1505257 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1505258 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1505259 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1505260 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1505261 efavirenz has tied or won every contest including this one
1505262 this reaffirms that in a population where clinicians are seeing very bad numbers and might think they need the boosted protease inhibitor
1505263 sexuality has always been very complicated and when you have to prove it as a matter of life and death you will use any resource you have available to you
1505264 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member
1505265 i have used facebook because people put stuff on there about themselves and who they are and in a relationship with
1505266 basically its like a jigsaw puzzle and you just try and take the little pieces here and there and you try and construct a larger picture of a persons life
1505267 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim and individuals may have to be more resourceful in their submissions a member of the board can accept any relevant evidence and then assign an appropriate value to that evidence
1505268 i do foresee the irb saying this is not an acceptable form of evidence
1505269 but until then i am going to keep on using it
1505270 we feel strongly take the shrubbery down and save accidents from happening
1505271 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1505272 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1505273 any discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1505274 but in the years now months run up to the olympics the reality has been numbingly disappointing
1505275 i suppose it was just a bunch of words when they made those promises
1505276 china is a responsible country we will fulfill the promises we made for the olympics
1505277 the ideas out there that china made commitments on human rights but its simply not true
1505278 nobody was in any mood to make any promises then
1505279 all the confiscated weapons will be made available to investigators
1505280 until now neither he nor his lawyer shahid karim have approached us for any assistance in securing visas for switzerland or otherwise if they do request us for assistance we will consider helping him
1505281 my dad passed away monday june 11 2007 at the age of 85 from throwing flour sacks down in a pasture for bases to world series games what a ride life took him on he was an ambassador for baseball instilling the love of the game to everyone he coached along the way
1505282 could you keep it down im trying to get your updates about the conversation were having right now
1505283 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context
1505284 that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off

1505326 we believe this is a totally inappropriate site for a wind farm as this region is one of the lowest wind speed areas in the country
1505327 we already have more than 1400 members who have joined the stop linton wind farm action group and have genuine concerns about noise health the accident prone a1307 and landscape issues
1505328 less than 20 per cent of our applications for wind farms get approved
1505329 although once they get turned down we always appeal at the appeal stage we expect around one in three to go through
1505330 as far as the linton wind farm is concerned we are currently collating the last of our studies to help us prepare an environmental statement prior to us submitting planning applications by we expect the end of the month
1505331 weve always kept an open mind but an increasing body of evidence suggests that wind turbines have the potential to affect the health of local residents as well as animals
1505332 i am particularly concerned about the animals here at the zoo and the possible effect of the turbines on some of our rare breeding programmes
1505333 generally seven or eight per cent of people feel strongly enough to write and object then maybe four per cent write in to pledge their support the vast majority around 90 per cent appear not to mind too much either way

1505339 marketing consultancies over the past year added 14 500 jobs up 10
1505340 reporters have moved into pr since the dawn of time i suppose and im sure its a market by market situation
1505341 but while the traditional media changes and as they change their reporting structures and what they are about there are certainly fewer jobs for reporters who are saying what do i do next and a logical step for a lot of reporters is to look at pr
1505342 we are starting to see students that would rather study pr than journalism because they feel the opportunities will be better for them based on whats happening with print newspapers and other media that journalism might not be as feasible of a career for them right now
1505343 networked journalism will save the industry and the world journalists need to use all the latest collaborative and open source tools of the web 2 0 revolution from blogs wikis and social networks to the virtual republic of second life to make their work more relevant and accessible to an engaged public
1505344 in the past journalists have proven themselves to be very adept at using new technology as it comes along the telegram telephone film video mobiles pcs were adopted quickly and exploited cleverly so why is online different

1505351 no more than one wind energy conversion system shall be permitted on a particular parcel subject to the application and approval requirements set forth below
1505352 all cables and power transmission lines from the wecs electricity generation facilities shall be underground
1505353 the total height of a wecs shall not exceed 60 feet
1505354 its not good enough the public is just not happy with it
1505355 i wanted a delay because theres not enough public input i suspect that it doesnt allow enough freedom for the individual who wants a small tower
1505356 the language is a bit cumbersome but it has to be
1505357 there has to be a lot of technical stuff its there to protect the individual
1505358 if were doing something cutting edge as were doing here we want the whole town behind it theres a way to do this without taking the wind so to speak out of the communal sails
1505359 there was a great furor over them and today we revere them
1505360 yes but its a small town the third bit is important
1505361 why dont we pass a minimum version to get to the greater good and then improve it as the need arises
1505362 all it takes is one bad construction to spoil it
1505363 i support this going to a vote and going through the democratic process
1505364 if the amendments are not ready like ducks in a row at the town meeting ill table it right there
1505365 theyre not major changes but theyre enough i hope to satisfy the concerns raised at the annual town meeting
1505366 everyone will have the opportunity to comment along the way
1505367 im praying that it does go through because we really need it and we cant wait
1505368 within the last three months weve had multiple companies racing each other through the doors
1505369 when we typically have little mountain ranges every time the air moves past its pushed up and over
1505370 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
1505371 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
1505372 other parts of the state are really kind of tuning in to the idea of big wind
1505373 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
1505374 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
1505375 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
1505376 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
1505377 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
1505378 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable
1505379 a lot of this has been what if until this point
1505380 what i hear is pretty positive support for having sustainable energy for getting away from dependence on foreign oil and the job creation
1505381 the landowner told me that this may provide his family with the opportunity to keep an old time ranch in one piece in their family for several generations
1505382 and that beats the heck out of 100 different ranchettes
1505383 wind power from southeastern oregon can balance wind power in the columbia gorge and make more efficient use of the electrical grid
1505384 to that extent were starting to get ready from a logistical standpoint
1505385 they do not realise how many peoples lives they are wrecking
1505386 as more and more people and more and more businesses and entrepreneurs look at renewable energy it was suggested we look at our ordinance and determine if changes are necessary
1505387 ultimately there are we are pretty silent as far as regulations and allowing them
1505388 there are just a number of categories will want to look at and the planner has provided a draft ordinance for the planning commission to take a look at
1505389 the ocean off of washington has the potential to provide all the electricity needed for the western half of the state by 2025
1505390 we are leading the investigation how to make this a reality and encourage everyone interested in locally genreated clean power to learn more about the possibilities
1505391 is this case about the same resource or the same environment its hard to see how its about the same resource but the same effects on the environment
1505392 further delay arising from the rma process cannot be in the public interest when we are dealing with a project of this significance being advanced during a time when the country is crying out for investment in renewable electricity generation
1505393 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1505394 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1505395 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting

1505454 id be willing to bet that the anthrax came from iraq
1505455 i know for a fact that it came from iraq
1505456 hmmm dang it didnt see obama as the messiah aint not gonna wote for that nig
1505457 we have still failed to solve the anthrax attacks that killed americans on our soil in 2001 we know that al qaida was attempting to develop biological weapons in afghanistan
1505458 they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1505469 relocating your business is a major project that takes a lot of planning
1505470 to be frank part of the draw to the property for me was the downtown frisco vibe here were surrounded by the advantages that go along with living in neon charged suburbia and being a member of the greater dallas extended family but frisco has managed to hold onto its true rural texas feel and thats the lure the town and its leaders embrace friscos heritage while enabling it to become one of americas fast growing cities all of these things factor into creating the kind of place we want to call home
1505471 so we figured we might as well make it official
1505472 we are extremely pleased to welcome steve to intrawests executive team
1505473 he brings a broad base of corporate experience and legal expertise to intrawest as well as a solid reputation among the legal community i am confident that steve has the right combination of experience skills and passion to strengthen our corporate infrastructure and we will all benefit from his guidance and leadership
1505474 we were forced into this we feel like the system that was used in 2006 worked really well for all the nations we werent forced onto the fis world cup to earn our olympic team size obviously fis had their reasons for doing this it conveniently forces everyone onto the fis world cup which will help legitimize them and sell sponsorships i think most nations agree look what happened in 2006 it was such a great show for the sport and for the olympics and so i think there was universal agreement that the system worked and why would we try and mess with that
1505475 all the nations are going to be pretty focused on the world cup for the next 6 7months so thats going to mean pretty heavy competition
1505476 our goal is to figure out how we can get on there and seal up our nations quotas as quickly as possible and figure out how we get high enough up in the rankings that even if we miss a few at the end were not going to drop out of the top 40 for men and top 30 for women

1505519 it is our belief that these changes and the management mechanisms will deliver on those aspirations and eliminate the sustainability issues that have challenged us with the current format
1505520 some of these ideas have been suggested or promoted previously and have been well supported in some of our research with rugby fans so we are excited at the prospect of putting them into action
1505521 we are very committed to ensuring that club rugby has its own time and space as we see the regeneration of the base of the game as critical to our long term future

1505537 the ministers decision to put money before lives against the advice of hiqa is difficult to justify
1505538 it is a tremendous win for us because with a game in hand we needed it to push us clear at the top
1505539 the first half was enjoyable but the win at the end was the main thing for us we gave away a clean sheet but the vital thing was the win and we got that
1505540 we created some really good chances and scored a couple of really good goals
1505541 i thought we could have had a couple more but in fairness to rovers they pushed us well in the second half
1505542 they big games are coming thick and fast now it is a big game for both clubs cork will fancy their chances of beating us

1505554 what we need to do with c difficile is for the government and nhs to concentrate on measures that work to help get rid of it

1505636 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
1505637 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him

1505671 given the increased volatility in the financial services market our clients are placing an increasingly high priority on understanding and managing risk across their portfolios
1505672 the strength in rmgs 2q results the companys second quarter as a public company reinforce the relevance and importance of the firms risk assessment tools and products to clients primarily institutional investors including hedge funds in an exceptionally volatile market
1505673 the large multinationals and financial institutions which were the first ones to decline almost a year ago in terms of their spending with us now are doing dramatically better
1505674 the evora is the biggest milestone lotus has achieved since the elise was born 13 years ago and is part of our bold five year strategic plan which includes the introduction of new cars and technologies to many more markets around the world the evora also represents lotus core values of performance through light weight and efficiency and proves that you can have phenomenal performance fuel efficiency elegant design and practicality all in a class leading mid engine 2 2 sportscar which will meet global safety and homologation standards
1505675 looking to the future we will continue to research develop and produce lighter more efficient vehicles which are linked to our extensive and well regarded work on all aspects of future fuels alternative engines and electric and hybrid vehicle solutions for the future we all have an environmental responsibility to future generations and the evora is another example where lotus is seen to make significant steps towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the motorcar keeping britain at the forefront of the high technology motor industry
1505676 a cornerstone of the designs success was working closely with the technical team to develop a package that allowed us to get the proportions correct
1505677 the asymmetric wheel sizes the short rear overhang long front overhang and cab forward visor screen all contribute to giving the car visual movement and an agile stance this is incredibly important to us because we want the cars aesthetics to communicate its driving characteristics
1505678 we never lost sight of the fact that although this car must provide real world useability sportscars are emotional purchases and that you have to seduce the customer through beguiling looks and exotic persona we are therefore very proud that we have been able to use technical and user functionality to positively drive the design in key areas and create some of the cars most distinctive features
1505679 we believe that our designs should be honest as well as dramatic and so we are really pleased with the fact that these iconic features all do a real job
1505680 overall the design language shows a clear dna link with its lotus siblings whilst establishing its own distinctive and contemporary theme the undulating shoulder line is brilliantly mirrored in the lower part of the bodyside by the cut away sill that creates a torseau like muscularity
1505681 your eye is drawn effortlessly from our signature mouth rearward by fluid surfaces and fast lines that create a sense of speed even when the car is stationary from this angle you can also see how dramatically the visor screen sweeps around the teardrop form of the cabin and the gently waisted plan shape perfectly accentuates the muscularity of the rear fender this is unmistakeably mid engined language and the evora is unmistakeably a lotus
1505682 a huge departure from what people might expect based on lotuss recent past we wanted the evoras cabin to feel special and to be surprising as well as sporty precision engineered metal inserts and quality edge lit switches are brilliantly juxtaposed against soft hand stitched leather surfaces to give a modern interior with a classic twist
1505683 the flat bottomed steering wheel figure hugging sports seat contemporary instrumentation and ergonomically positioned controls provide an intuitive environment that instantly forms a connection between driver and car ensuring that it becomes an extension of his or her body
1505684 tactile quality is incredibly important within this segment and so we wanted the interior to use honest premium materials much of the switchgear is bespoke and every metallic component is actually metal
1505685 this year lotus celebrates its 60th anniversary and it is fitting that 2008 is also the birth of the lotus evora a fantastic addition to the lotus range

1505702 smoldering otis redding inspired ballads full bore blues rock down home roots and country soul uproariously funky and melodic homespun tales that are gritty and deeply personal confrontational and universal greys resonant vocals are potent and authoritative mature beyond his age
1505703 grey and mofro fuse rock with plenty of soul and groove heavy blues and dirty infectious funk the deep and introspective lyrics are a breath of fresh air
1505704 weve been talking to them for the last couple of months to negotiate a deal like this it does take time

1505716 locky lockyer and hodgo hodges did not play a great deal through the middle grind of the year
1505717 hopefully they are feeling fresh we are still five weeks out of finals and we have got a pretty tough game this weekend
1505718 i think you just know you are in for a game when you go to new zealand
1505719 they have got some really big boppers and some good big strong outside backs
1505720 you cannot be me you can only be the very best version of you
1505721 we asked the question yesterday there was a slight haze right around the roof level
1505722 we didnt really get an answer to that but it was gone this morning and didnt have any adverse effect yesterday
1505723 if it had continued on it would be an issue
1505724 it wasnt there this morning so it wasnt an issue
1505725 its my understanding that park says hes going to swim under the world record and if he intends to do that hes got a very good shot at gold
1505726 theres a reason it has been a very difficult world record because it was set by ian thorpe whos a phenomenal swimmer
1505727 its a tough record i think were were still a little bit away from it
1505728 well have to see what happens park has said hell break it well wait and see how well he swims and what he can do
1505729 hes a very good competitor hes the current world champion im looking forward to racing him and giving him a good race
1505730 id love to have my personal best time in it thats probably my goal by how much im not sure
1505731 my expectation is to do it better than ive ever done it before better than the last two olympic games 2000 was tough athens was extremely tough this will probably be harder again
1505732 i probably feel a little more relaxed this olympic games probably enjoying it a little more
1505733 in this day and age loyalties are lacking in sport and often money talks too loudly
1505734 i think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed in sport and the ioc should have ensured this didnt happen
1505735 whether we have heats or finals in the morning or afternoon doesnt matter its about performance
1505736 we have done everything we need to be prepared for that
1505737 i think michaels a fantastic swimmer and i think if anyone in the world could possibly do it itd be michael
1505738 i think therell be a lot of people watching it hoping to see history
1505739 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1505740 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1505741 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1505742 johnson wrote to us to say he considered the medal was not won honestly and he was returning it
1505743 that team i wasnt familiar with any of them until today
1505744 but theyve got some players over there that are some pretty damn good players
1505745 we knew they were going to go out there and be physical and play hard not do anything dirty
1505746 i mean you had a little altercation out there but you understand that both teams are just out there playing basketball and just trying to win and compete
1505747 i think it was clear to me that they were an extremely well coached team they executed extremely well i mean theyre great
1505748 this is the best team weve faced so far in terms of their execution and how hard they played and it was a fun game to be a part of
1505749 mario is ill so he will be missing from the beijing event
1505750 but it will not affect other players we still have a strong team in the olympics and they are ready
1505751 je veux pas la perdre cest la m re de mes enfants
1505752 i believe kim kirchen is the rider whose characteristics are best suited for this course we saw he was very strong in the tour de france
1505753 he is the fastest of the three and he is the most dangerous
1505754 for many of us it will be the last time we compete in an olympic games so we will approach it with more intensity and more emotion
1505755 were one of the most important teams in the race but germany and italy are also strong
1505756 and we have to remember this is not the world championships its the olympic games so it is completely different from other types of racing
1505757 when we got off the plane we immediately noticed the pollution
1505758 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1505759 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1505760 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1505761 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1505762 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1505763 im surprised that he hasnt made himself available for service but as i have said people who do not have things to hide are easy to serve
1505764 the service requires him or a legal representative to be in court on friday when we have returnable an application for an injunction to prevent him playing rugby union in france
1505765 what we have done over the past week is pretty extraordinary in our view
1505766 we have retained process serves in two countries weve retained lawyers in england and in france who have co ordinated
1505767 i do not keep telling myself that i am 67 when i am riding
1505768 i used to be not very happy that every time people would remind me of my age as if telling me i was old
1505769 but i gradually accepted the fact that had it not been my age i would not have got so much attention worldwide
1505770 in our sport the spiritual aspect is as important as the physical side
1505771 i actually think that females tend to communicate better with their horses than men
1505772 surrender is not an option defending america at the united nations
1505773 a couple of 100 years ago the british took the game to all corners of the globe but we do not have that luxury anymore
1505774 we have got to investigate getting in to new areas as a sport and i think becoming part of the olympic movement is going to enhance that and twenty20 might get in there and bring that forward
1505775 places like obviously china and the united states are places that we would love to get into cricket
1505776 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1505777 i think its just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
1505778 so if the urine does not belong to the athletes who say the urine is theirs then they definitely have a case to answer
1505779 the strong canadian dollar has been a key damper on inflation pressures in the canadian economy
1505780 weve been up until very recently one of the few countries in the world where food prices were deflating
1505781 now things are starting to heat up a little bit because the damper from a strong dollar is no longer there
1505782 its possible that even although the economy may be weakening off a little inflation pressures could start to build
1505783 having spent such a long time in this very tight trading range typically currencies tend to move quite quickly when they break out
1505784 the likelihood is that the canadian dollar is going to continue to slide here potentially quite quickly
1505785 theres a tug of war between up until recently firmer commodity prices which is always positive for the canadian dollar against a weakening u s situation which weighs on the canadian economy
1505786 they kind of offset one another now i think if anything the u s situation seems to be getting a little more dire
1505787 unfortunately i think that cheaper export pricing is being more than overshadowed by the fact that sales generally to the u s our largest market are probably going to be suffering further because of a slide in ongoing demand there
1505788 unfortunately manufacturers have been facing the perfect storm over the last couple of years
1505789 it will perhaps provide a little bit of relief for the businesses that managed to stay afloat and re tool and keep focused on their core businesses
1505790 if they survived this its a question of what doesnt kill you perhaps makes you stronger in all honesty i think wont provide a significant degree of relief
1505791 the united states will videotape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1505792 obviously we knew that interrogations by foreign personnel were recorded since omars canadian lawyers had obtained release of the canadian videos from the canadian government whats interesting is that we learn more and more each day about evidence that exists in these cases that was previously secret
1505793 although mr khadr is no longer a juvenile he was 15 years old when he was alleged to have committed crimes in afghanistan canada has sought to ensure that the treatment of mr khadr is consistent with internationally recognized norms and standards for the treatment of juvenile offenders and that his age at the time the alleged events occurred is considered in all parts of the process
1505794 we remain concerned that other governments were in there and were complicit whether or not they were involved in ill treatment
1505795 the tapes could be evidence of human rights violations or criminal behaviour
1505796 protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1505797 translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1505798 notwithstanding what theyre saying this is not standard operating procedure
1505799 this relates to a common theme of the motions we filed yesterday monday which is the governments rush to convict omar while fighting our ability to get access to secret evidence or learn what else that government might have in its possession
1505800 may explain why prosecutors have fought so hard not to disclose evidence of omars interrogations at bagram and guantanamo bay

1505807 the catholic church forfeits all rights to respect for its ludicrous beliefs including transubstantiation while its anti condom campaign in africa results in tens of thousands of deaths
1505808 just because you believe that the cracker has some special significance doesnt mean that i have to respect that ridiculous belief i think the moral cost of disrespecting a cracker is a lot less than the moral cost of disrespecting human life a concept that should be more important to you people
1505809 i thought of a simple quick thing to do i pierced it with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash followed by the classic decorative items of trash cans everywhere old coffee grounds and a banana peel my apologies to those who hoped for more but the worst i can do is show my unconcerned contempt
1505810 can anyone out there score me some consecrated communion wafers theres no way i can personally get them my local churches have stakes prepared for me im sure but if any of you would be willing to do what it takes to get me some or even one and mail it to me ill show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare i wont be tempted to hold it hostage no not even if i have a choice between returning the eucharist and watching bill donohue kick the pope in the s which would apparently be a more humane act than desecrating a goddamned cracker but will instead treat it with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web i shall do so joyfully and with laughter in my heart

1505814 the more diverse the team is the more likely it is going to be smart and produce good work

1505817 the more this movie ages the clearer it becomes what an absolute classic it is
1505818 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
1505819 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
1505820 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that

1505832 socialising with friends can put your healthy eating to the test but thats not an excuse to hide yourself away stepping out on the social scene is all about making sensible food choices just as you do in the rest of your life the thought of entertaining friends can send the most confident members into a panic but remember you are in control of what is served why not use the experience to showcase how great healthy food can taste planning an evening when you are completely in control is one thing being a guest at the party where you have no input on what is served is quite another but that doesnt mean you should take the night off from working towards your goal

1505839 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1505840 rather than locking every single door lets get all the safes
1505841 not that we dont want to lock the doors but if that worked then we wouldnt be in this mess
1505842 youre not going to be one of those teenagers who never do anything you havent been outside in two days so shoo go outside
1505843 youre staying away until at least ten so i can vaccuum in a normal way
1505844 that something that can make so much noise also can be so quiet

1505856 i wanted to just quit and go but tamara wouldnt go unless we had work
1505857 that was a friday i got on line and by monday i had us jobs at a lodge on lake minchumina eleven days later we were packed and on the road
1505858 we took a bush plane from fairbanks to the lake from the air our boss pointed out the lodge and he pointed out the trail to get there then he landed 6 miles away
1505859 we got out and he said ok heres the snowmachine you know how to run one good see you later and he left he was a throw you in to the deep end kind of guy
1505860 i would build and open a wilderness lodge on the yukon river
1505861 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1505862 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1505863 were a good team and we havent been playing well
1505864 things happen like i said were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1505865 when we get there nigger is already written on our door
1505866 then theyll pass by this isnt three or four of them at a time this is 20 or 30 of them passing by over and over and over saying you nigger you bitch you are going to be killed this goes on on a daily basis

1505870 only smart athletic pretty dumb low class high class people get to choose that life
1505871 a little bit because of timing and a lot because of training i chose to focus my energy whats left over after raising a 3 year old on things other than youth advocacy
1505872 ive never been but im dying to try it it looks so cool
1505873 yes im going to knowingly make someone elses needs a priority and when thats done ill move on to mine
1505874 look at that im about to get all depressed because my moms in a bad mood someday ill just choose not to but for today here i go
1505875 i did this shitty feeling to myself and made myself suffer my bad but i also dont currently know how to do anything else my sad

1505881 the scottish league is only an instrument in the hands of the mafia and they are working really well
1505882 its nothing to do with the people its just the system
1505883 the main goal for hearts is not winning the league the main goal is to have young players playing and getting better
1505884 this might be the way for them to go to better teams
1505885 forty years to come rangers and celtic will be leading in the scottish premier league and they will be winning the league
1505886 what youre trying to do is protect an old firm duopoly for 40 more years and fool the fans
1505887 i want to call it an agreement against fair football in scotland
1505888 i see now that its not an accidental event but a well planned action with a purpose to destroy hearts players mood
1505889 we dont think its the best result because before the games against andorra santa coloma we had problems in the line up we had no strikers
1505890 of course the result is perfect but we hope we can go further now
1505891 well thats another reason i supported ron paul and will continue to support candidates like him he has never accepted such a pension as a congressman and likely wouldnt as president either mccain on the other hand has accepted xxxxx dollars while in office
1505892 i saved the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars by voting against wasteful pork barrel spending
1505893 go climb that tree go swimming in the pond go stick yer head in a plastic bag
1505894 people that vote decide nothing people who count the votes decide everything
1505895 i dont care who votes so long as i get to count them
1505896 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1505897 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1505898 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1505899 of course is doesnt i put the bottle back upright
1505900 but aunt gt then i wouldn t have a baby cousin
1505901 if you had children i would love them but i couldnt love them any more than i love you and so i want you to live the life you want to live and that will make me happy
1505902 its almost a shame to smoke it its like killing a unicorn
1505903 by all the criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
1505904 almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell the fertilized ovum zygote the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history or ontogeny of the individual
1505905 the development of a human begins with fertilization a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism the zygote
1505906 human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm unites with a female gamete or oocyte to form a single cell called a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
1505907 this cell formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm gr zyg tos yoked together represents the beginning of a human being the common expression fertilized ovum refers to the zygote
1505908 although life is a continuous process fertilization which incidentally is not a moment is a critical landmark because under ordinary circumstances a new genetically distinct human organism is formed when the chromosomes of the male and female pronuclei blend in the oocyte
1505909 after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being it is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention it is plain experimental evidence
1505910 i will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion with purity and holiness i will pass my life and practise my art
1505911 i will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of its conception even under threat i will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity
1505912 should the law continue to sanction the abortion of a preborn child which is unequivocally recognized by embryologists as human life so as to improve the convenience financial status and perhaps the overall wellness of the woman based upon her choice
1505913 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1505914 its obvious if they could take my father out of the grave and retry him and win again and again they would
1505915 what you have here is you have the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa florida so you have a number of new york related gangsters and mobsters coming down to the tampa area and this indictment relates to their trying to get a foothold here
1505916 i dont know i feel like saying you know its this vendetta but im so tired of hearing it myself from other people that you try to convince yourself its not and you try to convince yourself these are supposed to be the good guys and its just not working for me
1505917 if they were to come back at him they would look like absolute fools
1505918 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1505919 mr solana will discuss it with representatives of the five plus one
1505920 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1505921 its very important to feel safe when you come around anytime so i feel its very important for the police uniforms to be around
1505922 public safety remains the number one concern of the mayor and this administration
1505923 we have to get the overtime budget under control thats what our taxpayers demand thats what our city council demands
1505924 my husband fight one and i fight the other one
1505925 one was pointing at me one was pointing at my husband
1505926 i pepper with my pepper spray again both of them
1505927 to let them come and take my money just like that they dont work they dont do nothing
1505928 it took a lot of courage to stand up especially when they had a gun to her face
1505929 thats why i moved to virginia about 10 years ago because the cost here in new york
1505930 i guess youre just paying extra because youre a new yorker
1505931 we saw in the second quarter that exxon mobil made nearly 12 billion in profits so certainly theres some profit built into this and even at the refinery level the distributor level theyre making money and maybe the retailer is trying to break off a little bit for themselves as well
1505932 we the public havent cut back our driving thats the craziest thing
1505933 i dont have any choice but to keep buying gas because i need it
1505934 reducing the taxes makes no assurance to the public that that would be passed along to the consumer
1505935 sometimes even diagnoses can be associated with side effects and risks

1505937 prostate cancer is in fact an important disease and people unfortunately still do die from prostate cancer
1505938 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1505939 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with haart antiretroviral therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections
1505940 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1505941 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1505942 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1505943 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1505944 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1505945 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1505946 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1505947 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1505948 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1505949 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1505950 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1505951 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1505953 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1505954 thats why my new handbag line is called confidence its important just to feel in that way and to know and believe in yourself and everything is possible
1505955 i have to change the culture here with the team its gone so many years without being successful and its negative
1505956 we need to change the kids and what they experience so they can be successful
1505957 they want to be successful and its such a great environment to be in you dont always have to deal with the egos you have to deal with in mens hockey
1505958 the opportunity was the reason i switched over from mens to womens i was ready to be a head coach and i could start a program
1505959 for me ive had a lot of success and its opened up doors like coaching with the national program which would have never been opened to me if i had stayed in the mens game
1505960 realistically in the mens game id probably be a d 3 assistant i wouldnt be running my own program because there are so many other coaches out there who have paid their dues
1505961 my job was to basically start a womens program from the ground up
1505962 we didnt have any kids in place we didnt have much of anything we had a club team and i spent my whole year recruiting and the following year we played varsity
1505963 i looked at it as a place that i could be successful at and thats a big thing for me
1505964 i was there for 13 years so i guess it was like anytime you leave a place youve been at for that long
1505965 it was tough the toughest was leaving my players they were all great kids plus it was something i started my project it was tough to leave it
1505966 my first impression on coach flint was that he was wicked nice
1505967 which was one of the main reasons i went to saint as when i first started looking at the school he was always completely honest with me and very sincere
1505968 i only toured so he would stop bugging me but it was the best decision i could have made northeastern is lucky to have such a great coach
1505969 his passion and commitment for the sport go far beyond he is willing to listen to any of his players whether its about the team or even school and family problems he is much more than a coach but also a friend
1505970 the important thing about coach flint is that he keeps the game fun
1505971 he still recruited a ton of great freshmen and i know he is helping us find a coach that will fit the saint anselm environment personally i wish he stayed for my senior year but i respect his decision and i think it was the right one for him to make
1505972 consistently top 10 in the country producing olympians and national team players thats my vision to get the program back to where it was
1505973 im excited about dave flint as our new womens ice hockey coach because he values education and views himself as an educator
1505974 at the end of the day we are here to help contribute to the education of our student athletes and dave gets that
1505975 dave is an innovator and will create a fun and exciting program for our students to participate in
1505976 we are thrilled to have him as part of our northeastern athletic family and cant wait to get started
1505977 im not really sure where things have gone wrong i think they just hit a bad stretch a while back and just havent been able to recover from it
1505978 but my job is to figure out how were going to change it

1505981 take a moment to think about the sound of hepburn roosevelt plimpton and wfb
1505982 your native dialect is determined largely by who your peer group was as a child and has very little to do with how your parents speak and while exposure to other varieties and dialects can change how you speak to some extent i spent several years overseas in an anglophone country and came back to strangers in my home town asking what country i was from your speech will probably still be characterized mostly by your native dialect i did not sound like a native to other people in the country i was living in while overseas
1505983 the distorted reasoning for this ordinance as stated by ald burke is that the ordinance will increase public safety by targeting gangs and others that keep unsterilized dogs it is beyond reason to think that anyone who engages in dog fighting which is already a felony under illinois state law will obey a newly enacted spay castration ordinance or submit to background checks to apply for a breeding permit

1506008 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1506009 it said that sept 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1506010 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd

1506055 if the now commonplace forecasts for this recession of a 30 drop in house prices prove to be correct gordon brown will rightly be able claim that no government in 15 years will have done more than his to make housing affordable to people on low incomes
1506056 we could turn the current housing disaster into something good we could step back from the blind pursuit of 100 home ownership and seek to develop a properly managed institutionally financed rented sector pension funds and others would supply the capital to build properly designed and managed accommodation for rent just as they currently finance the development of office blocks and shopping centres the asset would yield an income and as domestic rents are closely linked to inflation it would be perfect for pension funds
1506057 now property prices are finally falling and sanity is returning to the uks housing market why then is the government even contemplating the notion of suspending stamp duty this would be a flawed policy both politically and economically just because a bad policy comes from the tories doesnt mean labour have to steal it the timing of this proposal is also rather foolish any prospective homebuyers still out there will simply delay their purchase until stamp duty has been suspended causing an even greater paralysis in the market

1506119 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1506147 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
1506148 toilet paper was everywhere papers were trashed everything was just everywhere
1506149 i think it is just an up and coming gang or kids just trying to make names for themselves
1506150 we would love someone to challenge this im shocked it has not been challenged in some of the other states where privatization has occurred
1506151 we see people do it a lot of times in different areas especially around here in southwest florida
1506152 its just something that we do we dont think about it
1506153 a lot of open areas such as us 41 in the pine manor area for example people will cross the median unfortunately weve had people struck by vehicles while crossing

1506155 he had no involvement in the house so far as the severity of the crime

1506161 government 101 with la mayor v and council prez eric g
1506162 while calling the new census important stokes said it does not mean gorilla numbers in the wild are now safe
1506163 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1506164 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1506165 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1506166 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1506167 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this
1506168 hey were doing just fine and we can close down this group and quit raising funds hey whos got the help wanted ads
1506169 the problem with liberalism is that theres nothing liberal about it
1506170 prior to the study we were not recovering 100 percent of our costs to inspect these stands
1506171 while we think the use of fireworks is dangerous were not using our fees to send that message at all our reason for raising our fees is to make sure our costs are recovered we dont want to use taxpayer dollars to process for the benefits of a few folks
1506172 while we apprecitate the need for fundraising we want to make sure the costs for processing those permits are recovered
1506173 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1506174 i think the black people would say he dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1506175 what does that even mean the audibly shocked beck replied
1506176 even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1506177 since hardball host chris matthews is reportedly considering a senate run against pennsylvania senator arlen specter in 2010 it gave quinnipiac university a thrill up their leg to go ahead and poll the matchup the survey of 1 580 pennsylvania voters between 7 30 8 3 had a margin of error of 2 5
1506178 we believe this rule change is necessary to reinforce the importance of accuracy at the highest levels of the game
1506179 i feel like its more challenging for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of the rough or out of the rough is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out i like that challenge
1506180 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget to keep it going
1506181 they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because there are enough engineers and r amp d research and development and technology that keep us from getting longer
1506182 if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway and hit a more crisp and a better golf shot its probably a good avenue i think its a positive move
1506183 i need to try and find a bit more consistency for me to really feel like i can compete when the gun goes off
1506184 my game is kind of coming and going right now
1506185 ive been working on trying to get it a bit more consistent but last week was like a typical week for me at this point two really good rounds i thought i had something going and then kind of a so so round on sunday
1506186 i felt like i was gaining on something but then came out on sunday and sort of fell away a little bit again
1506187 thats been disappointing i would love to get to a point where the feelings dont come and go so much
1506188 being a left handed person playing right handed i have some tendencies that tend to work against me in my golf swing when im not playing well
1506189 at that point i start fighting those tendencies its just something that i have to deal with and its about inconsistency i dont think im going to try and read anything into it
1506190 im just going to go work harder at it and try and find something that sticks well see how it goes hopefully it comes together come thursday
1506191 to tell you the truth it was i just couldnt believe it if i havent been playing very well this scenario wouldnt have never happened
1506192 ive been able to win 12 times out here but ive never been able to get it done in a major i never even really played well until 96 when i lost in the playoff to
1506193 puttings always held me back for the past three months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period if i putt somewhere near like i putted this summer ive got a great shot this week
1506194 set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september this will be a great place to do it
1506195 it just taught me i need to set more goals in my life my only goal was to make the ryder cup team thats all i focused in on this year
1506196 i believe as an individual you need to decide what allows you to play your best golf
1506197 and you need to go that direction regardless of the scrutiny
1506198 ive put a lot of pressure on myself here the last month and a half trying to get in that last spot
1506199 i dont want to be the guy that he has to pick i dont want to put the pressure on zinger to have to pick me
1506200 so from that standpoint i have put a little bit probably too much pressure on myself to make that last spot
1506201 as far as the state of my game its pretty close im not hitting it very bad im driving it pretty good
1506202 the part of my game thats struggling is around the greens which is going to be hard this week im not chipping the ball really well and putting is always my weakest point so thats what im going to have to figure out in the next day day and a half

1506205 even five years later richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationary on which the assignment was written
1506206 attempt to try as it were id say to diffuse sic the whole situation
1506207 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough yes it was probably too late i imagine for cheney im not sure it was too late for bush
1506208 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1506209 the brits wanted to avoid war which was what was driving them bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1506210 if these allegations are true it immediately raises the question of why tony blair was so determined to stick with george bush the case for a proper inquiry such as followed the falklands war gets stronger and stronger
1506211 even five years later richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationary on which the assignment was written
1506212 the guys from the office were just barraging us in the period this was different this was creating a deception
1506213 there was no such order from the white house to me or to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1506214 aku tidak pernah melihat rasulullah saw berpuasa keseluruhan bulan kecuali pada bulan ramadhan aku tidak pernah melihat baginda berpuasa dengan kerap di dalam bulan bulan lain melainkan bulan shaban
1506215 baginda sering berpuasa di dalam bulan shaban kecuali beberapa hari di dalamnya
1506216 ini adalah bulan yang orang tinggalkan di antara bulan rajab dan bulan ramadhan sedangkan inilah bulan dimana amalan diangkat kepada tuhan seluruh alam dan aku suka supaya amalan aku diangkat ketika aku sedang berpuasa
1506217 apabila pertengahan shaban tiba dirikanlah solat keseluruhan malam dan berpuasa keesokan harinya kerana sesungguhnya allah turun ke langit dunia pada malam tersebut dan pada waktu terbenam matahari mengumumkan adakah sesiapa yang memohon keampunanku supaya aku ampunkan adakah sesiapa yang memohon kecukupan dariku supaya aku cukupkan adakah sesiapa yang menghadapi kesukaran agar aku dapat ringankan dan dia terus bertanya sehingga terbit fajar

1506224 part of what makes fallout great is the juxtaposition of this very happy optimistic 1950s esque view of life pre war and then seeing it after things went horribly wrong

1506232 by now everybodys using the term cloud computing and the law is quite clear that even though its not dells fault if the phrase is now a generic phrase for that kind of computing nobody can own a trademark for it because people need to be able to describe the generic product
1506233 a registered trademark on this term would not give dell the exclusive use of it
1506234 dell was unfortunate to pick a phrase that was too close to the kind of phrase everybody was going to use
1506235 a very narrow right so if someone was to do what they are doing with this designation dell could go against them
1506236 you pay all this money for a mark so you can exclusively appropriate it if they sit back and do nothing and everybody uses it generically the argument could be made theyve abandoned their rights through failure to police their mark
1506237 if it does not indicate origin with dell and could apply to hp or ibm then it doesnt serve as an indicator of origin and it does not serve as a trademark
1506238 if they try to enforce the trademark they may not be able to

1506497 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1506498 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1506499 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia

1506502 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1506503 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1506504 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1506505 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail

1506507 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years

1506536 using taxpayer funded state employees to manipulate an election is unethical and a betrayal of the public trust

1506538 has truly sunk to a new low using state employees to try and buy people directly off the ballot
1506539 this latest stunt is another sad attempt by tom craddick to cling to his absolute power his attempts to urge qualified candidates off the ballot are just plain wrong while there is little doubt that he is desperate to save his own political hide this saga raises further questions about tom craddicks misuse of state resources and his taxpayer funded staff to pursue his personal political agenda

1506549 it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees then you shall act promptly for then the lord yahweh will have gone out before you to strike the army of the philistines
1506550 for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts the lord will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you
1506551 also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times and the priests shall blow the trumpets

1506555 so about three thousand men from the people went up there but they fled from the men of ai the men of ai struck down about thirty six of their men and pursued them from the gate as far as shebarim and struck them down on the descent so the hearts of the people melted and became as water
1506556 israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them and they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived moreover they have also put them among their own things
1506557 it shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban harem shall be burned with fire he and all that belongs to him because he has transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in israel
1506558 they raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day and the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of achor to this day
1506559 then all israel returned to ai and struck it with the edge of the sword all who fell that day both men and women were 12 000 all the people of ai for joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai so joshua burned ai and made it a heap forever a desolation until this day

1506609 we wanted to have every opportunity to try and trade him even though that opportunity may still exist now that weve passed the july 31 deadline it was important for us to continue our transition into a club that is looking towards the 2009 season even as we try to win as many games as possible this season
1506610 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1506611 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1506612 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1506613 he pitched his way onto the team in 2007 giving us an opportunity to acclimate him to the majors in a relief role and at the start of this season we thought his greatest value to the team in 2008 was in the bullpen
1506614 however as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 off season preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1506615 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1506616 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1506656 the acquisition is in line with our core strategy of developing our portfolio and increasing the scale of our business through differentiated quality brands at the same time it strengthens our position in the growing juice drinks category
1506657 this is just a good brand in a good sector
1506658 we like things that have the ability to grow and that have good solid brands and it just so happens that its largely at the still end of the market

1506716 personally my inner knowing says whats going to do it is by americans being terrified to vaccinate

1506718 i have no problem getting them vaccinated i think its good for them it keeps them healthier i think
1506719 im taking the moderate one and just delaying the ones that are questionable
1506720 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1506721 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1506722 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1506723 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1506724 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1506725 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1506726 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1506727 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts by some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1506728 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1506729 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1506730 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1506731 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1506732 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1506733 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1506734 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1506735 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1506798 working overtime has a disproportionate impact on women in dual earner households exacerbating gender inequality and supporting the separate sphere phenomenon in which men are the breadwinners while women tend to the home according to research to be presented at the annual meeting of the american sociological association
1506799 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
1506800 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common
1506801 es ging mir darum diese au ergew hnliche situation zu dokumentieren
1506802 luft kann an f llungsr ndern entstehen sich unter f llungen oder nach wurzelbehandlungen ansammeln gerade beim auftauchen will sich diese luft nat rlich ausdehnen und muss irgendwohin das kann nat rlich zu massiven problemen f hren
1506803 es kommt immer mal wieder vor dass diese wurzelspitzenresektionen dauerhaft nicht erfolgreich sind diese chronischen entz ndungen k nnen nat rlich wieder akut werden gerade dann wenn sich das klima ver ndert
1506804 es gibt nichts zu verbessern nichts was noch besser w r au er dir im jetzt und hier und dem tag am meer
1506805 gib mir farben gib mir w rme gib mir licht verbrenn den schnee
1506806 ich lasse einfach los denn ich mag keine ngste keine sorgen
1506807 es macht spa wenn die leute zu unserer musik feiern
1506808 it has been both fun and incredibly exhausting at the same time and has enabled me to combine two of the things that i love cars and filmmaking
1506809 it started out as a simple project but events along the way conspired to turn it into something i could never have envisioned
1506810 in an unexpectedly emotional journey eric explores the importance of friends hobbies and what it means to live life to the fullest
1506811 along the way eric seeks counsel and guidance from household names such as us talk show host dr phil and top gear host jeremy clarkson
1506812 i highly appreciated that president bush has on various occasions expressed his opposition to politicising the olympic games
1506813 we chose the date because eight has always been our lucky number
1506814 i like the way it looks that its continuous said ebert a home depot cashier
1506815 we waited until 2008 because i like eight otherwise we would have gotten married earlier
1506816 thats why we dont let the baby play with 300 pieces of technology
1506817 we heard a commotion jacquie got out of bed to go check on scout
1506818 the first time he walked up to our french doors that are in our living room and kind of peered at us
1506819 he was just looking and he slowly turned and walked away we saw him pretty much every night outside the house he was definitely not afraid of anyone
1506820 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1506821 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go
1506822 im hoping brandon will be with us the first couple of games because he is a big part of what we do
1506823 if i had an iphone i could look this up but theres no wi fi here so my touch doesnt work
1506824 im not sure about being on the at amp t network
1506825 and i want you to know im getting you a new ipod touch
1506826 it was really good for her to just walk across the street and grab things
1506827 i think its definitely a detriment to our community not to have these stores available
1506828 they have to look at this everyday on top of thinking its gang related and thats pretty fighting for the kids
1506829 i think a lot of people in the community are upset and frustrated that its still in this condition
1506830 he is very hopeful and cooperative and wants to work with the neighborhood to make it as good an area as he can
1506831 we would really like to see a workforce development center here
1506832 you have a sense of what we work on and what we attain and strive to do can be accomplished
1506833 well have come to a definite agreement within four to six weeks
1506834 im reasonably confident well get it done because there is a strong industrial logic i dont know anybody who doesnt think it makes sense
1506835 volatility and volume in the markets were the key this is a business which thrives on volatility
1506836 we are at the stage of integration planning we are trying to see what synergies there will be between the two businesses
1506837 i dont rate that chance very highly it would push icaps market share to a level where competition authorities and clients wouldnt like it
1506838 i wouldnt rule out anything that would create value for shareholders
1506839 we need to question whether the market has worked in the important area compensation the industry should not reward excessive risk taking or reward failure
1506840 boards and remuneration committees will have to reflect in future on whether the risks and rewards are appropriate
1506841 it is clear that there has been a mispricing of risk the market did not understand the value and importance of liquidity and some banks did not fully understand some of the instruments they were dealing in
1506842 as the financial crisis turns into a real economic slowdown the world is too inter dependent not to affect our markets
1506843 i think its going to be a big shock to sir humphrey but a necessary one
1506844 politicians are prone to exaggeration but it will be impossible to exaggerate the significance of this change this is a major challenge to whitehall
1506845 my ambition would be to set a regulatory budget as close to zero as possible
1506846 the costs will remain high and volatile though we have a much more solid recovery rate going forward
1506847 if you look at the civil aviation sector in the medium to long term we think its a great place to be
1506848 as a leading player in the origination transfer and trading of insurable risk
1506849 the financial market turbulence continues but despite this we are strongly capitalised and our investment portfolio remains sound
1506850 there was a judge that ruled for me and now its gone back and forth so well continue the fight
1506851 it would be our desire to have the written opinion from the appeals court but the order just says it will come in due course
1506852 it should have gone for me in the circuit court
1506853 they told me they were going to the supreme court with this and i hope they will but i wont believe it until i see it
1506854 they all have joined hands against us and we instead of blaming each other should sit together for solidarity and integrity of the country
1506855 the previous government would have abolished it if there had been any political cell operating in the agency
1506856 let me make it very clear that these are not those jihadis who fought during soviet union invasion in afghanistan
1506857 have a very real and direct interest in the outcome of this particular prosecution
1506858 baa cannot give preferential treatment to a single investor it would have to offer the same to every holder of the 2031s and perhaps to other bondholders too
1506859 i think the treasury could admit that they overlooked the impact of the tax changes on the life assurance sector
1506860 it was described nicely by one commentator as a drive by shooting of the investment bond market and it felt a bit like that to be on the end of it
1506861 delivered a strong set of results in market and economic conditions that have as we expected been challenging
1506862 spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1506863 to give you a basic flavour we are of course confident of having a positive result from our operations activities this year
1506864 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
1506865 top man to stock a rocky range 12 1 top man to stock a rambo range 12 1 top man to stock a sly stallone themed range 5 1
1506866 an unstimulating low paid job with few prospects especially one created by the expansion of the service sector
1506867 the company has told analysts in the past that it could afford an acquisition of about 1bn 790m but a move for michael page would be likely to cost 1 1bn
1506868 the company only has net debt of 1 1bn and if this was increased by the cost of the acquisition that figure would still be ok
1506869 it is a big acquisition though and would be tricky to integrate into its current business
1506870 this has surprised us it seems like adecco is taking a longer term view with this though because at present there are risks in the market for recruitment firms and we anticipate downgrades for some
1506871 michael page is a higher end company with higher average salary earners
1506872 however it is a people business so people on both sides would have to be behind the deal
1506873 inherently increase the taxpayers exposure in the event of a default
1506874 how much of the 3bn is returned will be more at the whim of the market if northern rock is ever sold than had the money been left as debt which would be paid off immediately
1506875 this does qualitatively increase the risk to the taxpayer if not necessarily quantitatively
1506876 deterioration in market conditions particularly the downturn in the housing market
1506877 there will be a short period during which we review the current structure and develop plans for the future
1506878 this is a cash positive business with plenty of stock great locations throughout the uk and passionate staff
1506879 he has been in the trade since birth and bleeds wine not blood
1506880 it is very difficult to borrow stock to short the shares now
1506881 while there is no official confirmation that all of these are going ahead we would not be surprised if this were correct
1506882 an excellent first half and continues to trade very well
1506883 this is another great set of results which demonstrate the strength of the group and the excellent performance of the recently acquired k amp f businesses
1506884 high oil prices and tight credit conditions are creating uncertainty for the airline industry generally
1506885 we see meggitt as an attractive value play and we believe the market could be over estimating the earnings risk at the company
1506886 we think the treasurys figure grossly underestimates the cost the government needs to look at the areas where it is responsible in social care the supply of locum doctors and ask whether it can afford to pay for the uplift itself
1506887 this will have a dramatic impact on the supply of staff to work with some of the most vulnerable in society
1506888 i knew we were up against high comparatives but did i expect sales to be 16pc down no
1506889 what is more recent is the use of public piks where a company already had publicly traded high yield debt then the sponsor would issue a pik offering on top of that which would also be held by high yield type investors
1506890 that was more of a bull market phenomenon where a sponsor would use it as a way to get a partial exit through a recapitalisation with a view to refinancing later
1506891 pik notes were largely issued to help investors get to buyout multiples other people couldnt match so the majority were in overpriced deals where other forms of debt werent available
1506892 pik holders have a right to stop debt being put underneath them and they are something of a dead hand on companies they make the equity disappear at an escalating rate and they demotivate management so its difficult to get them to do anything
1506893 the main problem is that piks are usually quite expensive and low down in the capital structure the fundamental issue is the ability of a company to refinance and the fact there is a pik in the capital structure could in turn make it even more difficult
1506894 yes theres a bullet payment yes you have deferred the interest but that can actually reduce the chance of a breach for some of these highly geared companies there are some companies that will actually be saved by their piks
1506895 to the extent piks are traded they are being sold on at prices in the single digits
1506896 even on those piks which arent due very soon theres a problem because falling sale values for companies have completely eroded the equity investors in the piks will therefore be out of the money
1506897 the private equity houses or their limited partners will also have invested in that paper as part of their equity investments piks have quite a disparate group of owners
1506898 a lot of hedge funds still record piks at cost plus accrued interest when actually the equity in them is completely worthless and they are charging performance fees against these supposed profits
1506899 we never do anything good we are very boring and useless and well never amount to anything and youre also quite shit
1506900 were quite a way into our next production cycle now

1506903 we have this culture of open communication were always trading war stories with insomniac and evolution and sucker punch were just one block away from sony santa monica the guys who made god of war and we get our designers together and i think it makes everybody stronger and smarter
1506904 as well as a level editor which is playable online with up to three of your friends
1506905 what you have among over the counter and prescription drug use is a very low perception of risk
1506906 theres very low social disapproval in fact there are parents who almost relieved that their kid is using vicodin and not smoking marijuana
1506907 there are guidelines out there but we dont think that theyre being routinely followed
1506908 just how hard people will work to get what they want when they are an addict
1506909 the film at its root is poking fun at christ and we dont want that to happen if someone was going to make fun of my wife in a film then i would oppose that making fun of jesus christ whom i love more than my own wife in a film is going to offend me

1506918 the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional

1506937 we admit that money politics exists in the division but we have yet to take any action we will bring up the case to the umno secretariat for further action
1506938 all these are like cancer which could destroy umno we are fighting each other by using not only money politics but also outside influence and threats

1506943 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1506944 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1506945 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1506946 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1506947 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1506948 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk

1507025 he doesnt seem to want to engage in any discourse

1507031 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1507032 it has been a dramatic bull story along with the commodity boom
1507033 the aussies fall is more a function of the rba than the us fed today

1507035 we dont expect any changes from them until 2009 once the housing market has stabilised
1507036 a party that does not strive for the seizure of power is worth nothing
1507037 one can see a time in the 21st century when both europe and the us will be in dire need of russia as an ally
1507038 as a child i excelled at nothing and little has changed since then
1507039 unfocused literary ambitions and no very strong sense of purpose and direction
1507040 the resurrection of the dead and what could be more miraculous than that
1507041 we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1507042 we wanted to have every opportunity to try and trade him even though that opportunity may still exist now that weve passed the july 31 deadline it was important for us to continue our transition into a club that is looking towards the 2009 season even as we try to win as many games as possible this season

1507046 winds of change adapting our communities to the changing realities of the 21st century
1507047 i dont care if were talking about fires earthquakes or floods
1507048 it doesnt matter what the disaster is the skills are for all hazards
1507049 but only about 200 of them are active once people are trained we urge them to bring others to the training
1507050 24 of japanese are mentally ill the rest are just batshit crazy
1507051 when we asked for the early morning wake up call i said to the young woman at the desk in the hotel lobby
1507052 not quite the wake up call we had expected but effective very effective
1507053 and i know because i was staring at us in the mirror over the sink we looked like a bad underwear ad in the macys catalog
1507054 and im sure it was a picture that would have made us chuckle had we not been so darn scared
1507055 stay calm i said ever the cool and collected one
1507056 uh dad said kevin who was 11 at the time
1507057 yeah well thats the latest in earthquake fashions i said rather sarcastically knowing that hed discovered a chip in the ol dad armor

1507060 men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all lifes ills
1507061 i define power as control over ones life a balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner
1507062 because the kid in me insisted on according it the biggest of big screen treatment what a disappointing film
1507063 where i witnessed a man playing a man playing a woman playing a woman giving birth to a child and doing it flawlessly
1507064 religious people were indifferent or even hostile to science scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith
1507065 we are all culpable each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature
1507066 there is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change
1507067 religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities
1507068 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1507069 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1507070 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1507071 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1507072 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1507073 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence

1507077 we agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic

1507079 both of my parents were from the mediterranean coasts france and spain and about two thirds of the menu at shelbys are things we enjoyed as kids
1507080 we still see many more overweight patients than underweight but its a challenge
1507081 we have to convince overweight people not to eat as much and underweight people to increase their caloric intake
1507082 its vital women know that pregnancy is no time to be starving yourself
1507083 during the nine months it is in the womb the baby is growing faster than it ever will in later life
1507084 what we expect is that whenever possible women should have a physical before they get pregnant that way they can be evaluated for risk factors such as being overweight or underweight
1507085 being overweight can lead to complications such as diabetes and being underweight can lead to problems such as low birth weight
1507086 we recommend to women that rather than going on a diet while pregnant they should consult a registered dietician and have a plan tailored to fit their needs
1507087 im just sitting here minding my own business playing my guitar to myself
1507088 i wish i owned all the land i can see from here
1507089 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity
1507090 i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1507091 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1507092 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1507093 im going to tell you there is quite a bit of it going on but technically no it is not an approved method for cooking
1507094 sous vide falls into a much larger category we refer to as rop or reduced oxygen packaging which is done not just for the taste of food but for storage
1507095 in laymens terms you have an incredibly moist flavor rich piece of meat that doesnt look or weigh a whole lot different than it did when it was raw
1507096 and sous vide works just as well with vegetables fruits basically anything
1507097 its obviously something that chefs like to do if they can be safe about it because youre not losing any of the flavors of food so its intensely flavorful
1507098 for me sous vide is something im not equipped to do here and thats why i dont do it
1507099 but its a really beautiful way to cook you can accomplish incredible things with it
1507100 as far as the safety of it well as of spring of 2004 all of my production at vancouver was sous vide and we did 7 million in annual food sales
1507101 so i really sincerely think that if i was going to kill somebody theyd be dead by now

1507124 vrouwen zien vier vuilniszakken in de gang staan en zeggen dan tegen de man schat er staan wel veel vuilniszakken h dat betekent gewoon dat je het moet opruimen waarom vragen ze dat niet gewoon direct
1507125 en dan vraagt ze houd je nog van me natuurlijk zeg je dan ja anders vraagt ze die vraag niet dat is voor de man nog geen probleem maar dan komt ze met de vraag waarom houd je nog van me en dan wordt het te moeilijk voor de man ik heb daar precies het juiste antwoord op je antwoordt gewoon met omdat ik graag de man ben die je maakt dat ik me voel dat antwoord is namelijk net zo vaag en ingewikkeld als de vraag zelf

1507149 an age appropriate rejuvenation where they look absolutely fabulous for their age
1507150 its not as much a pulling back of the skin as it is a muscle correction in the cheek i go under the fat pad and re support it to a place where it was earlier in time to recreate a younger looking cheek i go under the muscles along the jawline and neck and resupport them back to a more youthful position
1507151 a person looks good at seven days and very good at 14 days

1507162 due to credit rating changes which reflected a domestic and overseas economic slowdown and deterioration of corporate performance
1507163 expectations for recovering earnings for banks were not high compared with last year when there were prospects for interest rate hikes and flagging net operating profit higher credit costs and indications that profits will be disappointing ahead have continued exerting downward pressure on bank stocks
1507164 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports

1507192 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1507193 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1507194 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1507195 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith
1507196 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1507197 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1507198 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1507199 thats what you sort of do when you have been in opposition for a long time because government programmes get rolled out and get entrenched and people rely on them
1507200 look weve been very upfront with our agenda weve been talking at the weekend a lot about how to get new zealand moving again how to deliver infrastructure theres no hiddenness about the fact we wanted to use some debt to finance that theres no secret agenda we have an agenda that says we are going to do the right thing by new zealand

1507207 i dont want other people to think its okay to do what this gentleman has done
1507208 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1507209 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1507210 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1507211 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1507212 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1507213 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers

1507421 in planning the track i took into account two important things the undulations of the ground and the climate ive used the shade as much as possible and have kept the undulations to a minimum but there has been no re shaping of the contours you have to remember that we are running over a golf course and it will return to being a golf course as soon as the games are over
1507422 this is the first competition at this level in these hot and very humid conditions and horsemanship will count for a great deal cross country time will be an important factor and i hope the officials have the confidence to use the full extent of the track without dropping any of the loops the challenge is appropriate for the climate there will be some big fences as well as some combinations but it is not the biggest course the world has ever seen although it will be bigger than athens
1507423 we have had fantastic help from the hong kong jockey club who have a wealth of knowledge on the subject of footing and the ground has been prepared all around the course when rain falls in hong kong you tend to get a lot of it there has been 1 7 metres of rainfall since may but the ground should handle it
1507424 and dave evans has done a fantastic job building the obstacles i hope the track is challenging enough to separate the top riders from those who are not so experienced and yet i dont want to put mental pressure on the horses in the heat

1507451 you never can push them as far as they can go the reality of the peak performance of the console is yes you could look to a generation beyond where we are now and think yeah i could use that power but the reality is in 360 and the ps3 and the latest generation pc graphics the amount of power in the gpus is such that youre more bound by your creativity and the aesthetic youre going for than youre really bound by polygon pushing power
1507452 youre probably actually more bound maybe by art authoring and the amount of data throughput that just the amount of memory youd need but i dont think 360 has reached its limit
1507453 if you see some of the stuff weve done in fact some of the stuff our guys have done the gpu particle systems and things like some of our guys have been working on the geometric style real time radiosity

1507461 in washington d c gordon smith has been doing what is best for ted stevens and george bush not what is best for oregon

1507466 i have been proud to fight alongside the independent party to take on special interests to pass sweeping ethics reform protect consumers and end the gridlock in oregon washington d c is broken and gordon smith is part of the problem america needs new independent leaders to change washington d c and turn this economy around
1507467 it was good to get started yesterday our coaches and our players were excited to get out on the field obviously handling the heat and being able to practice as efficient as we wanted i wasnt as happy with the practice but we did get a lot accomplished when you go back and watch the video you see good things that maybe you dont see when youre on the field and were not working at the tempo that were working at weve just got to get use to that were bringing the freshmen out early about 45 minutes of individual technique so that when the vets come out and join them they know the drills and they can repeat that its an opportunity for them to get caught up and compete for a position thats why we do that at that i think ill just open it up for questions
1507468 we will definitely work on the physical part of the game i do believe that you do some type of hitting every day and you get use to it and you get better at it i believe thats how you stay healthy there will be a time when you quit doing ones vs ones and you do more of what we call cross over where you still have a very fast look with ones vs twos and the twos are giving us a different defense playing that off cards then theres a part where you go against scouts but we will always do some periods where it is ones vs ones but not quite as much as we did in the spring
1507469 they definitely worked hard in the summer in the voluntary workouts im not sure it all showed up yesterday simply because of the adjustment to the faster tempo and the heat and some anxiety there were certainly some guys out there trying a little bit too hard and when you do that you kind of wear out a little quicker i do think the timing of the passing game and that is certainly ahead of where the first day of spring practice was but like i said i think we have a long way to go as far as being able to keep our intensity our practicing with a purpose because there was a point we hit yesterday because of the heat and the fatigue that some guys were practicing to get through the practice as opposed to practicing to get better
1507470 nathan dick has really improved since we started spring last year theres no question about that he knows the offense better im impressed with his movement and his feel in the pocket again ive said this before we really might not know how good nathan is until its live tackle and he has the chance to move out of the pocket and make plays because when youre not hitting the quarterback you blow the whistle early or he moves and throws the ball when he could have run for 15 yards he has a real good sense of where the pass rush is coming and how to move i think hes throwing the ball a lot better alex mortenson continues to do a good job of operating the offense particularly in the run game he understands what we want to do he made a couple of good checks yesterday in that aspect the two young freshmen were at an all time anxiety high yesterday they were trying to go as fast as they possibly could so weve got to get that slowed down and be more precise with their footwork and just relax a bit they were both pushing and trying real hard and thats not that unusual that happens in the first practice they are both very competitive and they both want to do real well they just need to relax and become accustom to the tempo and the speed of the game
1507471 i guess i never thought about any deprogramming or anything like that we just try to install our offense and really work hard on his technique ive been really impressed with casey on how much his technique has improved and how coachable he is the greatest thing about him is he tries to listen to exactly what you say and then he tries to do it the next time that gives him a chance to keep getting better and really have a good year for us his footwork has improved tremendously when we tell him he needs to sit on your third step before you deliver the ball hes worked hard at doing that i think his accuracy has really gone up i look forward to him having a really good year for us
1507472 that allows you to be able to build our team with the young skill guys that we have i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game they give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball i think our defensive line has a chance to really grow and get better theyve had a very good summer theyre stronger theyre faster and i thought that adrian davis and jake beckett had real good practices yesterday and im looking forward to seeing our inside guys getting more work too
1507473 he is much more confident theres no question the last scrimmage prior to the spring game he executed well distributed the ball had an understanding of what he was seeing and where to go with it in the spring game for the most part he did a nice part he got bogged down a couple of times in the red zone he knows that we have high expectations for him and hes starting to have those same expectations out of himself like i said as long as he can see the coverage distribute the ball properly i really think his accuracy and his timing have improved a lot
1507474 oh theres a lot of teaching a lot weve got a lot of work ahead of us there was pretty good carryover from the first practice weve already basically gone through that two times already and there was good carryover they were communicating well up front so you knew they had an understanding of what were doing im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard i thought the running backs worked hard yesterday michael smith did a nice job and was giving us some good leadership out there deanthony curtis and dennis johnson i thought showed their abilities i think that weve got a chance to keep improving but weve got a long way to go theres no doubt about that
1507475 well its basically were going to be playing with an outside linebacker slash nickel slash strong safety its a kind of a combination of the three walner leandre who we didnt get to see a lot in spring ball in the physical part of it he was out there in the movement and looked real good and athletic at that hes kind of that size that we want i think it will be a good position for him dallas washington is about 218 pounds and very physical he came out of spring ball doing a real good job and then weve got some young freshmen to compete for it
1507476 well alex has got to do a great job of being consistent i know that he wasnt happy with missing two field goals yesterday hes back healthy he had a tough summer he had an injury that occurred and we went through that i think he will be a really steady force for us we feel like anytime we can get the ball on the 40 43 yard line we should get three points hes got the ability to do that the other two guys at tackle are going to be very good theyre doing a nice job and robert salinas is a guy that we moved from linebacker to defensive end in all our spring video he showed great ability to rush the passer is very quick can bend and will be utilized as a rush end and a little bit in our nickel and dime package where he can do both a combination of a linebacker and an end
1507477 leadership wasnt as good as i wanted yesterday but i think throughout the summer they did a nice job they worked extremely hard we voted for captains and we did a nice job picking captains offensively its not hard to know who they are casey dick and jonathan luigs defensively its jamar love elston forte and malcolm sheppard thats who they voted on for captains and we always do that the first day when we report to camp right before dinner and the reason that we do it then is we want to make sure they know who the guys are leading them through the summer who did the good job of organizing things and making sure everyone was there and working hard through the entire summer
1507478 no we do it where offense votes for offense and defense votes for defensive captains there are a lot of times where we didnt have the freshmen vote but since they were here all summer long most of them we did have all the freshmen vote
1507479 no the coaches vote we get the strength coaches involved with it and all the coaches get a vote offensively it was pretty easy defensively it was close and thats what we had three captains on defense rather than two we usually have two on each side of the ball but because it was so close we decided to have three captains
1507480 the first thing that weve got to make sure we do a good job of and im real happy with our knowledge of how to handle the heat and handle the humidity is that each day were careful and we do things right well always take a break during practice we have fans set up we get a lot of gatorade in them our new trainer joe sheehan spent 12 years with the jacksonville jaguars in the heat and humidity down there with all the heat and humidity down there he knows how to deal with it thats the biggest thing we weigh everybody in before practice we weigh them in after practice and then we weigh them again the next morning we want to see how many pounds they lost in practice how many they gained back over the night we had a couple of players that lost up to 10 pounds during practice and then they gain it back if they dont gain a certain percentage of it back then they dont get to practice the next day the first and foremost thing is making sure that the health of the player is at mind and we were going to do everything for that i dont think we can worry about wearing them out everyone has the same amount of practices but what you do need to do is as we get closer to the game we need to get fresh we need to get our legs back and we need to make sure we are at full speed its a real timing of when we want to peak and be at our best for that opening game and were a long way from there so we get to pound them for a while
1507481 i think well need to get a lot i really do when you look at our depth at running back you know they will have to jump in there and go and the great thing is i think they have the opportunity to be special players they way they can move their hands i was impressed with how quickly they learned how focused they learned how they paid attention to detail and the different things we have an opportunity to do with them at receiver weve got to get production from some of those freshmen and coming out of yesterday joe adams and jarius wright showed some real good signs showed some real speed joe dropped one deep ball but his ability to separate after you get 20 yards down the field is exciting for me because he really has that stride and looked like one of the fastest guys on the field yesterday
1507482 we were really happy with what he did hes the speed and size you want at that position talking with coach reggie johnson after practice hes very focused and really wants to play right now that helps a lot hes a quick learner too i like the looks of our freshmen secondary theyre good looking theyre big theyre fast you look at khiry battle and his physical size and look matt marshall hes going to end up being one fastest guys on the team for us certainly very flexible and real good hips tramain thomas is a taller longer corner which were trying to work to get but thats a real good looking crew elton ford eltons a guy that weve got to slow down a little bit he was like the quarterbacks yesterday he was trying to do everything so hard and so fast that he was a little bit out of control but he certainly is a big powerful young safety that i think will end up helping us as the year goes on
1507483 well you work on it you work on running with the ball after the catch you work on one on one tackling and open field run against the defensive backs which is a great drill for both of them you try to get them in a position where when they catch the ball theyre moving and catching it on the run so you can get more yards after the catch but we also recruited to it too thats one of the strengths that i really think jay wright is going to have and joe adams is there ability to make things happen after they catch the ball carlton salters is in great shape he looks faster he made a couple of real nice moves and runs after the catch which excites me a lot because he has sure hands he understands how to get open and that was the thing we really wanted to see improvement out of him in the spring was making yards after he catches the ball i know hes really making a conscious effort for that
1507484 jerry franklin looked good and his movement is good he has more understanding of what were doing so he got lined up quicker and faster a lot of times with linebackers the test is when you put pads on and then you start stepping up and taking blocks on and getting off blocks and making tackles i think for them when youre just in helmets its an easy day you learn more about them once we start hitting
1507485 one of the first things is how quickly we move on and take from what well have in the meetings today and last night to practice this afternoon we continue to install well be running new plays and new defenses and new things in the kicking game today than from what we did yesterday so the ability to really take it from the meeting room into the individual technique and fundamentals drills then into our group drills and thats why we end it each day with team drills is we want to see how well they carry that over a lot of times with young players they will do a nice job in individual drills your technique work but when you get into a group drill theyll still do ok and execute do alright there but once you get to that team aspect of it now things begin to start falling apart a little bit so we want to see them carry it over and execute when the entire team is put together and thats a lot of our coaching we want to make sure we have a progression of everything were doing and make sure that we practice and were working towards putting it all together as a unit
1507486 thats a lot of quarterbacks and ive not been involved with that many were going to have to let it play out for about 10 days and then make some decisions about who the one is who the two is and theyll get most of the reps and most of the work you need to get more reps for them ryan mallett is going to do as much as he can to get him ready for the future and we threw him in there yesterday at the end of what we call our pass skelly or the seven on seven part of it and he looked really good he did a real nice job hes improved on his footwork hes got a great release and throws the ball real accurate its going to be hard on him because he such a natural leader to have to stand there and watch a lot is hard hes just going to have to make sure he has a good redshirt year and he can either have a real good redshirt year or a bad one and he needs to have a real good one
1507487 hell get some he did some stuff yesterday the best thing about ryan is his personality is such hell go do whatever it is you ask him to do he was happy to run over there and give 15 minutes to the defense i think it will just be whatever style of quarterback were playing that week if were playing the running style and the read option style hell probably stay over with the offense if were playing the drop back thrower or the spread offense where they throw the ball a lot then hell probably be over there servicing the defense thats part of your redshirt year
1507488 its an area that we make sure we get the right guy back there and coming out of yesterday michael smith did a nice job he understands what hes suppose to do and weve got to figure out if hes the guy we want back there really i thought dennis johnson with the young guys was real natural a real quick five yard 10 yard burst which is how you get a really good punt return deanthony curtis i mean weve got some talent back there its just a matter of continuing to work with them find out when we get the live returns to see who can catch the ball when theres people running at them flashing in front of them and continue to concentrate i thought coach tim horton did a real nice job with the technique and the fundamentals on how to catch it it will narrow itself down well continue to work the whole group and sooner or later well figure out who can handle it when the pressure is on
1507489 no we had couple of new guys on that elton ford is a guy we want to look at as a kick returner he was a real powerful running back with a long stride sometimes we want to have a little bit bigger kick returner because you have to hit it downhill and have some guys bounce off your hips so well have a few more guys working back there on kickoff return
1507490 yeah they know theyre going to get the ball and the good thing about that position is there is going to be a lot of competition it will play itself out i thought we had a few too many hit the ground yesterday we expect to have a lot of completions we expect to not have drops and were certainly working toward that
1507491 weve talked about what our expectations are in the classroom and off the field and how to conduct ourselves socially and we continue to work hard towards that certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer we are not proud of and it is not going to continue
1507492 coming out of the spring michael smith was definitely the number one guy a couple of other guys had been injured a little bit i think our freshmen are really exciting deanthony curtis the first day out there shows a great burst and really made things happen same thing with dennis johnson i think those are definitely three guys that are going to have to carry the load and make things happen and play real well for us albert gary is another freshman who wasnt here this summer so hes a little bit behind the next couple of weeks will really tell who is going to step forward and get the most carries but we will definitely us all of them and whatever their talents are i think thats something weve always tried to do with our backs use them to do that
1507493 you could go all four years really our first two years at louisville we averaged over 200 yards a game rushing too so you can show them eric shelton lionel gates michael bush and coby smith all four of those guys made it to the next level and had a lot of carries its easy the biggest thing in recruiting is when you can get them in and show them film when you can actually show them film of the offense i remember sitting down and showing deanthony curtis our whole running back tape and all the different ways were going to use the back i think showing them on film is the biggest thing thats what i always try to tell recruits to make them show you on film dont let them just talk to you cause half the time theyre just telling you a story if they can show it to you on film that really helps
1507494 i thought it was good its a whole different level of intensity and level of how they practice they hit the wall a little bit but i thought joe adams came back he definitely hit the wall at one point in practice but he came back and caught that nice fade route for a touchdown he made some nice plays joe has a definite different speed he can go out when the ball is in the air something good to have out there i thought jarius wright had a real good day i thought he fought through the getting tired the best of all four of them and he had some good quicks and good change of direction the two big kids kind of hit the wall it was hard on them they werent use to that level of intensity and working that hard so those two hit the wall a little bit but i like their big size i like them in the release drill they showed some strength they could throw some guys around those are four guys that really excite you that could be a great class to keep those four guys around together thats what youre really hoping for you got two guys that can play fast and stretch and change direction and then two big guys that can be physical its very similar to some of the groups that we had when we were at louisville
1507495 oh i think its a little bit of everything the anxiety of going into your first day of practice theyre out there for an hour before the vets came out there theyre not used to going at that speed and level of intensity in the individual part i dont think it was as much out of shape as they have to learn how to fight through it when they get tired
1507496 rod showed some good things at the end of the spring and did some nice things but hes got to kind of as you said yourself he has to be consistent every day and go out there and play at a fast level he has a chance to be in the role its wide open once you get past london crawford and carlton salters those two have stepped themselves up above everyone else and after that its pretty wide open everybodys competing to see who will be the next guys are
1507497 definitely i think he did a great job of working hard all spring improved and got his footwork a lot better hes worked real hard at learning the offense learning the system he did a good job of getting everyone out there during the summer he ran the show and did everything hes worked real hard and his confidence level is up and our confidence in him is up i think hes really improved and we feel really good about him this is a big month for him its a big month were repeating the insertion of what we did in the spring so each day he should get better and better and feel better about the offense
1507498 oh i think thats a huge part of coaching youve got to put guys in a position to give them confidence in practice so they see themselves having success then they walk around with a little more bounce in their step and feel better about themselves everything is about confidence in anything you do and if you feel confident about yourself youre going to play better its important for him to have success weve always built our offense around the quarterback being successful and having confidence so we try to do things for them to have success early in a game or in a series to get into that flow and get into that zone and get to feeling good about themselves and thats kind of how we all are if you feel good about yourself and confident youre going to play better and coach better be a better husband or whatever it is
1507499 we really dont talk about anything thats happened in the past we really just move forward and try to teach our offense and we have a way that we try to teach it and how we work with the quarterbacks so we really havent worried about what happened in the past we have a big offense and a lot of stuff to learn hes worked hard at it and done a good job its just really important for the upcoming days for him to continue to improve
1507500 d j williams had a real good spring he did a lot of good things hes got to continue to go out there and improve andrew davie is a guy that runs well after the catch he does a good job of blocking at the point of attack ben cleveland came on at the end of spring and had a good day yesterday he ran around and had some nice plays yesterday had one blown assignment but he did some nice things theyre going to be a big part of our offense and were using them a lot of different ways so theyve just got to keep working hard continue to improve
1507501 well being accountable is being accountable to yourself to your teammates to the team and to the whole university of arkansas every day coming and going out there and getting better and preparing to be the best i think thats the biggest thing weve got to really make sure we understand as we go out there to the practice field every day to be the best offense in the country not just to get through practice when we can get that thats when we know were where we need to be were not going out there to get through practice were going out there to work hard and be the very best we can be thats what we need to understand thats being accountable
1507502 i knew that question was probably going to be proposed to me and stuff
1507503 we have a great anticipation for that young man the game seems to come fairly easy to him the more reps hes going to get and because of our depth there hes going to get a lot more reps hes come in here with an attitude to be a starter on this football team when you bring that type of attitude youre not going to take one play off and have a good play next youre going to continue to work hard i mean obviously we have that attitude at that position but gosh darn theyre so excited about being here and about understanding and learning the system and the thing about it is that where is different weve got older players here that are helping those younger players come along thats important if im an older player and i look over my shoulder and i see this freshman i can handle that two different ways i can either be a helpful factor as a team player and help coach that kid or i could be that older player thats a little concerned about getting pushed and shut that kid off weve got some people that are helping these young men besides our coach reggie johnson who does a great job but weve got some older players that are helping these young men and theyre not afraid to ask questions its always easier to ask a peer a question because youre probably going to get an honest answer youre going to get an answer of experience you ask a coach that kid might not feel like that question hes asking is not a smart question so hes a little shy and timid in asking a question so you either get those guys that ask questions and our approach is there are no dumb questions they keep asking questions and learning and you get that kid thats afraid to ask that question and that guys going to stay stalemated for quite a while
1507504 were playing this young man at an outside linebacker basically hes kind of a mix between an outside linebacker and a safety type position were playing this young man as an outside linebacker were still in a 4 3 scheme so were looking for a hybrid speed efficient connect the dot kind of player what weve got to get better at that position is being the stout player that were expecting out of that position taking on blocks quick to read understand fits so were looking for an intelligent football player where the game is a lot quicker down in the box than it is on the back end so all of a sudden if you take a kid from the back end and move him up there then that game is that much quicker snapping fingers rapidly to be able to connect the dots there youre looking for a guy that has a feel for the game and picks things up quickly
1507505 the quality of college football my last years in college football were about 12 years ago im not sure when my oregon state stop was in my career but i did had a break between my first and my next three stops the quality of college football is amazing and i continue to see that when all of a sudden as an nfl coach were getting ready for the draft and free agency or the draft itself and watching college football develop i mean it is so much more diverse than it has ever ever been and its a lot different from the pro game a lot different the fact that you have to play option football and read zone football you dont see that in the nfl trying to get involved and now that becomes part of my thought process thats where i really look for help from coach petrino because of his experience and our defensive staff thats been a big stepping stone for me and then these gosh darn hash marks theyre so wide now i told coach i think it was yesterday that coach and i had this conversation hey coach im not real familiar with these hash marks so i looked for coach horton and coach petrino and i get their advice on it but it is a growing situation for me in regards to that the attractiveness of this game now at the college football level is immense just because of the diversity i think you become a better football coach going through this level now ive accelerated and i dont see it as a step back for myself i see it as another growth period in my career im always one to sit down there and grow each day and learn something different the other thing is too is you have got to be extremely organized and youve got to make sure that our players understand the message of that because theyve got to learn to be organized not just with the game but also with school it keeps me on my toes i love to wake up in the morning and come to this job
1507506 rush the quarterback hit the quarterback what kind of pressure it depends on how we match up ive been in programs where you have to create pressure because your four down linemen cant get there thats a feast and famine when you deal with stuff like that if you cant create pressure with your four down linemen now all of a sudden youre back there and theyre holding on to the ball for an exorbitant amount of time an extraordinary amount of time doesnt matter how sticky the coverage is somebody is going to be open if we can get a development in our four down to be those pass rushers so were not always having to create pressure were going to be so much further ahead and have the advantage to pick and choose when do want to pressure again its just a matter of how well we develop and find those guys who can rush on down and distances that pertain to that they still have to play both phases both run and pass
1507507 i cut my teeth on blitz whether thats going to be the case here well pick and choose it goes back to the question i just answered when do we want to do it what personnel group do you want to do it with what down and distance do we want to do it i cut my teeth on pressure i learned that a long time ago that as a player and i learned that as a coach throughout my career you know as far as what we want to look at percentagewise maybe 60 percent non pressure 40 percent pressure each game its going to be something different and how we view our opponent you just cant go in and think pressure pressure pressure and again if we do that every single down eventually its going to jump up and bite you in the rear end youve got to sit down there as a staff and look at it see what the game plan is going to take care of itself were looking at a 60 40 balance that might be too high might not be high enough it depends on what we are doing but weve got to be solid like i said if were going to pressure weve got to be solid against all the phases its not just the passing game all of a sudden they have some options in their responsibilities theyve got to deal with as well
1507508 its a great challenge if we can understand what our offense does to be honest with you weve talked about it as a staff were probably not going to see a whole heck of a lot different from anybody we face our offense prepares us for two back one back spread those things if we understand our roles and how to get ourselves out of situations then if a formation all of a sudden creates a situation that weve got to get out of were going to see adjustment were going to see formations the only thing weve got to make sure were square on is peoples personnel we have some fine fine personnel on offense to be able to sit down there and judge our players against the personnel we have on offense at the skill positions day in and day out is a competitive situation so well be able to go into the game with confidence when we play whoever we play

1507529 last week was the final week of the july session before the traditional august recess
1507530 were the most important issues facing the nation and should be worked on before anything else in the senate
1507531 the bottom line is that the legislation never got a substantiative vote
1507532 unless the drilling legislation goes first it is likely that republicans will continue to hammer away on the issue and prevent future votes
1507533 that said political pressure is causing a lot of democrats to cave on their position on the drilling legislation and its likely that some form of that legislation will pass before any other meaningful legislation in september if that happens or if republicans lessen their tactics the shield law could be brought to the floor and would likely get more than the needed 60 votes to proceed
1507534 the good news though is that expected presidential candidates barack obama have endorsed the legislation maybe it will get pushed back until january but hopefully by then it will draw more support
1507535 you should lower your expectations then you will love it

1507557 i hope landry is done with his criminal ways but i dont really know how to respond to that i would like to see just the fact that its still with him if thats subtle or whatever it is but i hope he doesnt kill anyone else that was rough
1507558 doherty will reprise her role as brenda walsh who was last seen headed to london to study acting
1507559 as previously announced jennie garth returns as kelly taylor now a west beverly guidance counselor tori spelling returns as donna martin now owner of an upscale boutique and joe e tata returns as nat owner of the peach pit
1507560 remember that one time when you were on the stoop
1507561 i was like just tell me more about the wire
1507562 its just this off network continuation of the barney legend
1507563 we have sarah booked for four episodes at the beginning of the season and possibly more and on how i met your mother you never know whats going to happen
1507564 shes great and the more we fall in love with her you never know there will be a fantastic stella arc at the beginning of the season that im ridiculously excited about and i think people will love it regardless of tasslers statement i do feel like people will not know which way were going and thats intentional and it could go either way
1507565 were hoping the show will go a while longer and its a good mystery well milk it a while longer
1507566 we have not made it clear to anyone other than ourselves quite yet who the mother is
1507567 we always talked about it ever since the episode zip zip zip which is the episode where barney and robin play laser tag and smoke cigars and all that stuff all the fans picked up on the unbelievable chemistry
1507568 that was always break glass in case of emergency story line and you know what this is now an emergency
1507569 coming back but may not have the ability to speak
1507570 oh is this too much hype will there be a backlash
1507571 you were the best crude sexual term here i ever had
1507572 did he just compliment her insult her break it off what just happened
1507573 does that mean hes going to get married to me
1507574 you never were don draper and youre never going to be
1507575 why does the female black widow spider eat the male after mating
1507576 you boys and girls in a state of suspended adolescence you sicken me
1507577 talking about my mother in front of 6 500 people its every jews dream
1507578 youre going to see him barefoot in the very near future and thats pun intended the very near future
1507579 i got an e mail from joss that said gang we broke the internet thats all it said which is awesome
1507580 we had this home baked idea that we love and were proud of
1507581 we made this on the understanding that wed never make a dime but its blown up beyond our expectations
1507582 w e were just hoping it would build over time people would start to spread the world and people would enjoy it
1507583 we didnt expect everybody to try and see it at once
1507584 once i actually downloaded jed singing the unfinished tracks i had trouble not listening to it
1507585 i listened to it all the time partly because i had to sing it partly just because i think the songs are really really catchy ive watched the three parts probably seven or eight times each and i was in it i gain nothing by doing that except i think that theyre really clever
1507586 while we were filming it i thought we were sitting on something unique and good and i know that joss cared about it enough that he wouldnt mess it up in editing or change its trajectory
1507587 joss has some strange giant master plan that includes much more than a sequel
1507588 joss thinks on a great many levels so when he was pitching it to us he said and this will take over the world and there will be sequels and musicals on stage and feature films and well get our own television network and theyll name awards after us and things like that
1507589 i think were all giggling like little schoolgirls for about a week or so then hell figure out what he wants to do next
1507590 well i would suspect that barney would be very dismissive of dr horrible
1507591 hes a bit nerdy but i think dr horrible would probably win the fight just because barney probably represents all the guys that laughed at him when he was younger and hes got a freeze ray gun so that probably gives him a leg up on his foes
1507592 dr horrible on a scale of one to 10 is a 10 and barneys like 27
1507593 one person saw the name of my interview downloaded the podcast and listened to it while driving he liked it so much that he gave it to his father company ceo
1507594 the fact is there are echoes of what happened before with firefly so some people are worried
1507595 my response to that is first of all thanks im glad you care and also you can be worried the show could have all the support in the world from fox and still not be successful theres no guarantees in this business the fact is their support hasnt wavered but they did sort of view what id done as a little bit different from what id sold
1507596 i looked at the first pilot with a very cold eye an executives eye and said ok i know what they want that they dont have
1507597 i asked them do you want a new pilot earlier and they said no no no we just want to figure out how to make this work i said heres how youre going to make this work im going to write you a new one they were very grateful
1507598 no matter how free they feel coming and going from the dollhouse in essence they are completely tracked
1507599 we wanted a very nurturing environment and thats why we went with spa spa spa in the d cor
1507600 we wanted natural elements we wanted to do anything that would say this is not anything but a happy harmonious home dont ask any questions
1507601 joss whedon shoots new pilot of his show for fox
1507602 ok i know what they want that they dont have
1507603 no no no we just want to figure out how to make this work
1507604 heres how youre going to make this work im going to write you a new one
1507605 you need an ensemble you dont want to be in every scene you need a mythology that is bigger than the character or youre going to go nuts youre going to get exhausted and burn out after two seasons at best if you have a big ensemble its a more interesting world and you can relax one day a week
1507606 oh this character would really be attracted to this and this character thinks this about that character this characters terrible secret is going to be so fascinating when it comes up against this characters terrible secret
1507607 some people will check this out maybe other people will hear about it so by the time it is on dvd and its still exclusive on itunes kids but maybe theyll be drawn to it
1507608 joss has run out of ideas all he can do is be mean
1507609 it wasnt a question of doing everything differently although they changed the ending it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong they said the lines mostly but they said them all wrong and they cast it wrong and they designed it wrong and they scored it wrong they did everything wrong that they could possibly do theres actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script and people assume that if i hated it then theyd changed the script but it wasnt so much that theyd changed the script its that they just executed it in such a ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable
1507610 amy is the ideal comedic talent to star in this new series from the executive producers of the office
1507611 weve been hotly pursuing her for some time to make the transition to primetime
1507612 amy shines in everything she does she can make even bad material funny and i know we can write bad material
1507613 and shes one of the funniest most talented people ive ever met she is a terrible human being but i am more than willing to overlook her many many character flaws for the chance to work with her again
1507614 the tonight show has a remarkable history rich in tradition were proud of each and every show jay has shared with america as we look forward to conan carrying on that outstanding tradition next year
1507615 we also cant wait for jimmy to showcase his winning style following conan jay has left his personal stamp on the tonight show for what will be 17 years he is enormously creative generous and professional
1507616 im literally waiting for the first person to talk about how overrated it is
1507617 matt lays a lot of track like he did in season 1
1507618 and the payoffs come fast and furious as they did in season 1
1507619 you get to see what you dont get to see on most tv shows
1507620 you get to see them with these different faces and then finally you get to see them alone loneliness is part of the show because i think its part of the human condition
1507621 its sort of nefarious but its dignified theres no one going on maury povich and saying i slept with my mother and her sister secrets today are given no value because everything is exposed whereas then everything was secret and on three martinis too
1507622 a lot of the information that the audience gets right away no one else has
1507623 that was the suspense is this situation going to explode how could she not know does she know
1507624 to me the mystery and suspense on the show and almost everything on the show comes from the tension between the different people we are the different selves we are
1507625 the monumental nature of these womens challenges the definition of their roles is almost a mental relief for a modern viewer however appalled we might be
1507626 you can turn your radar off for an hour and from a purely entertaining perspective these are some well written dames
1507627 because matt weiner is rather fearless and because of the settings of the 60s we can throw it all around and no one can be like
1507628 he was kicked around for quite some time in his life until he decided to take charge of it himself and rewrite it
1507629 as free as you think you can feel when youve created your identity out of whole cloth it certainly comes with a lot of other unintended consequences that pay off down the road
1507630 something in don from his past is so broken in so many ways that hes got to do a lot of the work to fix that before he can truly move forward and find real happiness that is not ephemeral and meaningless
1507631 its the oldest human experience in the world you get it then you dont want it
1507632 they know my desire is the same as theirs to reach as large an audience as possible
1507633 there are certainly a whole lot of hanging chads from season 1
1507634 dons secretary peggy had a kid junior executive harry cheated on his wife roger was almost dead theres a lot of stuff thats still simmering
1507635 you dont know how he got there you know hes not don draper but you dont necessarily know all the details of how he got to where he is
1507636 i feel like last season was about this group of people and how they related to one another and this year its about that same group of people and how they relate to the world you see a lot of the changes that the world around them is going through
1507637 while i enjoy the ambivalence of what world am i in and how can i maintain my integrity i think that we need to see nick give into some more temptation and that i would say is the change of course for the character of nick that rather than standing back from it and seeing it and weighing it theres going to be a few times when he makes the choice in a direction where its going to make him a little dirtier and its going to cost him
1507638 i think last year nick sometimes was dealing with a lot of ambivalence and this season rather rapidly nick is going to sort of dig into being an active part of this family in a way that he wasnt last season and its going to happen in a number of very concrete plot ways
1507639 its really more dirty more sexy and more money than it was ever before
1507640 whoever you are i have always depended on the kindness of strangers
1507641 i can say and i have said that its not true
1507642 ultimately is going to work his way up within the team and ultimately become the head of the unit
1507643 a very interesting dna that is going to inform the duality of the character
1507644 he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
1507645 right now its not a problem per se its something hes curious about in terms of his own sort of his own genetic code
1507646 i can see headlines would be serial killer joins csi i mean how would you phrase it
1507647 tempted to ask a questions about jericho just to drive up traffic on our web site
1507648 this season were honing in on really making it a show that the stories tell more of the ethical dilemmas that our doctors have to face
1507649 there is surgery in it because addison is a surgeon and she gets back to doing that
1507650 i think when it just became kind of a soap opera about those peoples lives there was a lot of talking a lot of time in the coffee room taking about the angst thats not that show
1507651 the idea of letting anyone else take the show from me kind of makes me sad and sick to my stomach i would rather just its my thing and im going to take it through seven years and you know i think were going to get out while people still like us
1507652 i would put her in a coma thats what i would do
1507653 izzie is toast izzie is toast izzie is toasty mctoasterson
1507654 well be done writing the show approximately at the end of february and the first episode premieres shortly before that
1507655 theres not really an opportunity there to get any feedback it will be sort of more of a traditional cable model which quite frankly scares the expletive out of us
1507656 bush has to go to a furrin country to get people to adore him
1507657 im not saying what hes doing there overnight let me tell you itll be by far the most provocative lady heather episode weve ever done
1507658 if a story line creatively needs grissom then hes totally willing to come back and do it
1507659 what cbs president nina tassler was really getting at when she talked about the character was that the new character has a genetic complex a number of different genes and elements that have been correlated with criminal behavior
1507660 hes an academic he has a background in clinical pathology
1507661 he decides that this might be an interesting way to explore himself he feels that if he has these genetic tendencies maybe a way to see if he has the ability to become a criminal a way to look at it is by understanding and studying violent criminals what they do and why they do it in a sense its like holding up a mirror to himself but in an exciting and interesting way its a new career thats really the angle were going with
1507662 you know we havent gotten to that level of really kind of nailing down the guy its really about a guy exploring who he is trying to use the world of solving murders and violent killers to understand his own soul
1507663 to me dexter is not a about a guy whos trying to decide if hes a serial killer he is a serial killer to me dexter is about a guy whos trying to decide if hes a human being its actually the exact opposite
1507664 our feeling is and you never really know til you actually cast it is that hes going to a more volatile maybe a little less predictable character than grissom but again this is in the very early stages
1507665 theres a whole segment of the fan base that goes crazy over this personal stuff then a whole segment of the fan base that doesnt want that stuff at all
1507666 you can never make everyone happy and if you try to youre bound to fail all you can try to do is tell a great mystery week after week after week
1507667 listen i can do the show so lets do it
1507668 i dont want to know because if i know then ill blab it out to somebody like you
1507669 caprica follows two rival families the greystones and the adamas as they grow compete and thrive in the vibrant world of the 12 colonies enmeshed in the burgeoning technology of artificial intelligence and robotics that will eventually lead to the creation of the cylons the two houses go toe to toe
1507670 look to do this justice we probably need it to be longer than two would you be willing to do that
1507671 hey if were going to do one what would it be what do you think
1507672 ok well if its peter that meant the spacecraft would probably be this three camera catch it as you go style that means the virtual part will have different aesthetic and the reality show will have yet another aesthetic
1507673 i cant talk to you about virtuality right now im trying to write the battlestar galactica finale
1507674 who gives a expletive about the plot lets just talk about these characters
1507675 i was on the plane and i was crying and the guy next to me didnt know what was wrong with me
1507676 ok were in cic and adama is there and tigh is there and we need a stunt player
1507677 heres a trick in a script to set this up here and pay it off there this is how that story is usually done dont do that shift it this way
1507678 he has to say this it seems obvious to me that the next scene has to be that
1507679 is ron up at three oclock in the morning all the time is he crazy
1507680 hes like a bricklayer brick brick brick swoosh of concrete across the top brick brick brick swoosh
1507681 oh that makes sense too i just didnt see it
1507682 polly walker plays sister clarice willow the eloquent and duplicitous headmistress of the athena academy eric stoltz is daniel graystone a computer genius and leading businessman of the 12 colonies paula malcomson stars as his wife amanda graystone an accomplished neurosurgeon with her share of secrets
1507683 shot very different and i think i was particularly attracted to the idea of doing a science fiction piece that was not built on a foundation of action adventure it wasnt about vipers and it wasnt about the cylons attacking every other week it was really a character piece it was really a drama and you can infuse with a lot of political commentary and a lot of religious overtones and really dig into a people and a society and how and why it all came unglued
1507684 set 50 years before battlestar galactica caprica follows two rival families the graystones and the adamas bound together by tragedy their ensuing struggle will determine the fate of the 12 colonies
1507685 caprica is a society rife with advanced technology little do they know they are trembling on the brink of the creation of the first cybernetic life form node or cylon
1507686 passion intrigue and betrayal set the stage for the coming revolution
1507687 the graystones and adamas come from different cultures and wildly different socio economic backgrounds
1507688 their bitter rivalry will bring the end of life as they know it
1507689 caprica is produced by nbc universal cable studio and executive produced by ronald d moore and david eick battlestar galactica and remi aubuchon 24 it is co written by aubuchon and moore and directed by jeffrey reiner friday night lights
1507690 lets go find earth and sharon is a cylon and there are 12 models
1507691 he has to say this it seems obvious to me that the next scene has to be that
1507692 look to do this justice we probably need it to be longer than two
1507693 shot very different and i think i was particularly attracted to the idea of doing a science fiction piece that was not built on a foundation of action adventure it wasnt about vipers and it wasnt about the cylons attacking every other week it was really a character piece it was really a drama and you can infuse with a lot of political commentary and a lot of religious overtones and really dig into a people and a society and how and why it all came unglued
1507694 this is news to anyone who has been buying nbcs line that they are in negotiations with leno about doing something else for the network
1507695 ill believe that when i see it and i think abc is taking a huge gamble asking nbcs audience to shift over to abc for jays sake but this is tv and with egos and money and demo points at stake anything is possible
1507696 by replacing him with that inane smart a conana obrien theyve thrown out the best late night host they will ever have

1507704 what i loved about fidm is that every one of my instructors was in the beauty industry fidm supports you not only in your education but afterwards in your career
1507705 if you dont know fit and you dont know patterns youre not a designer specialize in something and know the basics
1507706 fidm is one of the best known fashion colleges in the world they have the best connections its very expensive but what you get in return is

1507709 i dont know if he may have been involved or not involved but he certainly didnt make the product and he didnt make it at ft detrick

1507711 individuals create value for organizations through the impact of their project network not through their position in the organization chart
1507712 when you aggregate personal data in profiles eg facebook you risk imposing structural limitations on the conversation and on the way groups form this leads to severe restrictions on value and growth creation in your network

1507780 we need to focus on preventing domestic violence but the government has largely ignored preventative work and instead has passed more criminal justice legislation and even this hasnt been implemented properly
1507781 why have they still not implemented the domestic violence restraining orders that were promised four years ago this labour government is letting down domestic violence victims

1507784 christian and conservative students shouldnt fear discrimination or censorship by university officials simply for expressing their beliefs
1507785 the university is a marketplace of ideas where all viewpoints are welcomed and this significant ruling makes that clear
1507786 it exaggerates only a little to say that americans in their 20s and early 30s divide into two groups of about equal size those who are married the majority of whom participate in religion and those who are not married the majority of whom do not participate
1507787 marriage is a gateway into family life and family life in turn is often a gateway into church attendance
1507788 the longer people postpone marriage the less likely they are to attend church at a given age and also the less likely they are to attend church down the road
1507789 one thing churches need to do is to really encourage their teenagers and their young adults not to buy into this culture of hooking up and even the culture of dating or just hanging out
1507790 churches need to create a culture of courtship that puts them on a path to marriage for those who are called to marriage
1507791 i think connecting young adults to families who have different priorities and different challenges and different joys would help them see the world a little bit differently and hopefully grow in their faith at the same time
1507792 bob novak is rare in american journalism a columnist who works the phones to stay in touch with sources and keep his columns full of fresh news instead of stale rehash
1507793 he is a social conservative who understands the importance of faith in politics his recent theme that sen mccain is ignoring evangelical voters at his peril has been exactly on point well all miss his work
1507794 were really glad the 11th circuit recognizes the seriousness of this constitutional violation and hope the university complies with the court order

1507796 prostituted teens are still children and are victims of trafficking
1507797 it will take the combined efforts of federal state and local officials to put an end to this modern day slavery
1507798 elected officials exist to serve and protect the public order i think people need to begin asking their candidates about trafficking issues to gauge who will take the task of enforcement seriously

1507827 two points one they know they are lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1507828 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1507829 ive been play it safe hiding behind words but the truth is i love god
1507830 since god is in you you can only love god as much as you love yourself
1507831 we must absolutely avoid strengthening any kind of formal institutional religion
1507832 im more interested in the purer form of fascism and while i dont subscribe to the whole worship hitler thing his comments on multiculturalism and politics in general are still just as relevant today as they were 70 odd years ago
1507833 i cant say im into the whole national socialist thing as far as im concerned national socialism died with its sic creator not that i do not have any regard for his writings indeed they still have much relevance today he laid a foundation that we should build on

1507835 reclaim new south wales reclaim australia voting for anything other than australia first is largely a waste of time
1507836 there is always a danger for new parties to rise
1507837 it happened before because people werent being heard in the bush but people in the country are pragmatic they will see a stronger party in a better position to win and we will have to deliver for them

1507840 my campaign will be centered around environmental and development issues principally in relation to the unit boom around the shire
1507841 given the tensions certain development proposals have caused in areas such as bass hill and camden i would vigorously oppose any similar developments that would threaten the peace and harmony of the shire
1507842 we most certainly do not want a repeat of the scenes we saw in cronulla a few years ago
1507843 islam is a problem but people can change their religion but if youre an asian you are an asian
1507844 the great danger of people like rudd is dragging australia further in the direction of asianisation
1507845 nick griffin rescued the bnp from the murky depths of of right wing extremism
1507846 hes got quite a lot of publicity and some of it strikes a chord with the locals here
1507847 that will really depend on how far the present economic downturn goes and whether they have the leadership and organisational ability to expand beyond a small core of activists
1507848 right wing extremist movements have tended to be energised in periods of economic difficulty and during the life of labor governments both federal and state
1507849 its in periods of economic stress that significant numbers of voters have tended to become fearful of external pressures on their living conditions

1507874 and frankly being a committee chairman is not leading a great organization or making great things happen and for that matter you know whats happened in washington in the last 25 years have you seen the kinds of results that america wanted did they get the job done unfortunately not so if he has been a leader where has it led us look at his legislation mccain feingold that hurt our first amendment rights mccain kennedy that was granting amnesty to 10 million illegal aliens and then now mccain lieberman that wants to put a huge tax effectively on american gasoline buyers and rate payers his record is not of the kind of leadership youd want to have

1507900 im surprised at how excited everyone is for me im amazed at the support
1507901 ive been saying my goal is to make the finals ill be tweaking the technical part of my jump during training so i can put myself into position to do well at the olympics and then whatever happens happens
1507902 i think it will take a jump of 47 6 to make the final on aug 17
1507903 i dont feel like i had a great jump at trials i think i can go a few inches farther
1507904 i always act like i won but ive never ever won goucher said unembarrassed by her glee
1507905 winning was a huge accomplishment for me said goucher who plans to compete in both the 5 000 and 10 000 in beijing
1507906 four years ago was probably ground zero for me it was a low time but obviously something was still there i never stopped believing
1507907 inner monologues that made her mind as fragile as her body
1507908 i ate a lot and i gained a lot of weight she said
1507909 there were times when i asked myself am i crazy
1507910 i learned to appreciate my running so much more because of that there was always a little hope in me i never completely flamed out my first year working with alberto when i ran 15 17 which seems so slow now i was like theres still a fast girl in there somewhere
1507911 it proved to me i can compete with anyone on any given day but this is like im an olympian this is the childhood dream
1507912 we are certainly looking at it and we didnt need prompting he said
1507913 there have been several price inquiries we have issued and you can tell that the asx was closely following the share price of asciano
1507914 what interests us now is that following their trading halt they confirmed that they only made a decision on that offer on the morning of the offer
1507915 it was a sad ending to an otherwise wonderful visit to americas heartland
1507916 ive never been like a huge fanboy of john mccain
1507917 some people asked why would you let her do this i could never tell her no and about six matches into her career word got out that she wasnt going to back down
1507918 i was flying back from a usa wrestling trip to new york right after the olympic trials when it hit me
1507919 only eight american women have ever had the opportunity to wrestle in the olympics it took a lot of hard work and there might be people who dont think girls should be doing this but ive gotten so much from this sport its definitely worth the fight
1507920 a lot of times in a smaller town something like this would not fly
1507921 but her mindset and the way she handles herself off the mat makes it easy to respect her
1507922 she never tried to prove a point she wrestled just because she enjoyed it she was just being ali
1507923 from the time my girls were in the womb i told them they could do anything they wanted
1507924 there was one match when i told ali that scoring one point could be her goal she looked at me like i was crazy she wanted to win
1507925 i knew it would be tough but when she heard negative comments they just fueled her thats the kind of person she is
1507926 pin her and pull her around the mat by her hair
1507927 i dont think youd like her to do that to your son
1507928 i think what got her through the guy girl part of this was that she is extremely mentally tough
1507929 she sets a great example for all kids with her work ethic and her passion for the sport
1507930 she never expected to be treated any differently from the guys to us she was just always part of the team
1507931 since january all weve done is train train train we might get out for a walk or a movie but shes dedicated herself to putting in the work
1507932 i knew in my heart she was going to make it when she did i had to go outside and take a few deep breaths it is an awesome thing
1507933 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy
1507934 this is yet another worrying set of statistics confirming that the financial crisis continues to deepen
1507935 particularly concerning is the construction sector which usually shows a strong requirement for temporary labour
1507936 this is a clear indication that the credit crunch has started to reach the jobs market
1507937 business confidence is low and as a result employers are becoming much more cautious
1507938 oh i lost touch with that person what a shame
1507939 were going to push each other to play and to compete
1507940 its going to benefit the team hes definitely a great goalie theres going to be competition obviously but its always like that with any nhl team this year is going to be a little more than the average team but its great were going to work together and make it happen every night so we can get some wins
1507941 as soon as i was on the market the blackhawks were very aggressive
1507942 for me that was a great opportunity to come to this organization
1507943 we want to have an opportunity to have the best goaltending every night if by chance thats not going to work as far as number of games played or not wanting to be here then we have to look at that if its keeping khabibulin we do that if its not then we move on and we try to do something that makes sense for both of us
1507944 ive been with the hawks for 32 years and i dont worry about that kind of stuff
1507945 well just have success and see where that lands im not concerned
1507946 no one has anything to worry about its not like were holding any sword of damocles over anyones head as far as denis were going to do just fine

1507960 i have chosen the race that you are to run in because i know that you can win it just like at the olympics if someone is a fast runner in a short race that is where they place them if theyre a fast long distance runner then they are chosen to run in that event

1507977 davanti siamo atomici e non sono mai stato cos bene mi sento parte del progetto vogliamo lo scudetto e rester a vita alla juve i rossoneri quasi un nemico come linter
1507978 e bello vedere che non sono pi da solo a pensare allo scudetto ha detto ieri david intervenendo al premio torretta a sesto san giovanni ma adesso arriva la prova della verit sappiamo che siamo forti ma il momento di vincere uno scontro diretto farlo a san siro con il milan sarebbe lideale
1507979 in questo stadio mi sono tolto grandi soddisfazioni e spero di continuare cos abbiamo fatto belle partite contro roma e inter dobbiamo ripeterci con il milan limportante andare l con umilt sapendo per che non abbiamo nulla da invidiare a nessuno
1507980 il nostro attacco atomico superiore anche a quello del milan lo dicono i numeri assicura david e continuiamo a migliorare con il palermo abbiamo dimostrato qualcosa di importante il morale alto e andiamo a milano per vincere
1507981 credo che quello che vedete adesso sia il miglior trezeguet di sempre ho fiducia e in campo si vede mi sento parte del progetto e rester a vita alla juve sono molto carico e mi sacrifico volentieri cercando di dare il mio contributo in ogni zona del campo come mi chiede ranieri
1507982 il milan un avversario storico quasi un nemico esattamente come linter in pi campione deuropa e questo aggiunge un sapore particolare la champions ci manca e forse gi questanno avremmo potuto farla bene

1508000 i was surprised to see rita macneils name mainly because i didnt know that she had been involved in feminist groups in the early 80s
1508001 they were being spied on because at the time they were perceived to be very radical
1508002 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that
1508003 the police didnt perceive that this change was coming about because they werent looking in that direction basically

1508006 industry is beginning to turn to sweetener systems that can cost effectively offer enhanced sweetness taste and functionality along with the convenience of single ingredient delivery for ease of use in manufacturing
1508007 an important focus for us is on the development of customized sweetener systems containing erythritol
1508008 there are often also synergistic advantages achieved when erythritol is used in combination with other polyols and or sweeteners
1508009 in addition to helping reduce calories and minimize laxation concerns related to some less rapidly absorbed polyols additional synergistic benefits may include improved sweetness mouthfeel body and or masking of off notes

1508016 we now have an excellent team led by harvey mcgrath who has done a terrific job in a short time at the lda refocusing the agency on its priorities and restoring public confidence in its role his wealth of experience can be shared across the organisation and is exactly the right person to steer the lda on its new course giving value for money in its delivery of the skills jobs and regeneration that will keep london ahead of its competitors
1508017 the decision by boris johnson to exclude labour from the london development agency board even though labour are the second largest group on the london assembly is a direct attack on the accountability and transparency of the lda
1508018 an act of political factionalism that is not in the interests of london working together

1508026 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
1508027 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
1508028 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1508029 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
1508030 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
1508031 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1508032 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1508033 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1508034 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1508035 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1508036 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1508037 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
1508038 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
1508039 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies

1508049 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1508050 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve

1508064 a contract is a transaction a covenant is a relationship that is why contracts benefit but covenants transform covenant is about the logic of co operation
1508065 covenant is a key work of tenach the hebrew bible where it occurs more than 250 times no one put it more simply than the prophet hosea in words we say every weekday morning at the start of our prayers
1508066 a covenant is a betrothal a bond of love and trust covenant allows us to face the future without fear because we know we are not alone though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me covenant is the redemption of solitude
1508067 the greatest jewish thinker of the 20th century a rabbi named joseph soloveitchik he determined that there are two different kinds of covenants there is he said a covenant of fate and a covenant of faith and they are very different things
1508068 a group can be bound in the covenant of fate when they suffer together when they face a common enemy they have shared tears shared fears shared responsibility they huddle together for mutual comfort and protection
1508069 a covenant of faith is quite different that is made by a people who share dreams aspirations ideals they dont need a common enemy because they have a common hope they are defined not by what happens to them but by what they commit themselves to do that is a covenant of faith
1508070 now we understand how it was that the israelites had two foundational moments the first in egypt and the second in sinai
1508071 why is it that no one made this distinction before rabbi soloveitchik in other words before the second half of the 20th century the answer lies in one word holocaust
1508072 at the level of faith jews in the 19th and 20th centuries were deeply divided
1508073 the covenants of abraham and sinai are covenants of faith
1508074 god says never again will i destroy the world but i cannot promise that you will never destroy the world because i have given you free will all i can do is teach you how not to destroy the world
1508075 all three elements of the global covenant are in danger
1508076 friends i stand before you as a jew which means not just as an individual but as a representative of my people
1508077 you remember the end of the book of genesis after the death of jacob the brothers of joseph fear that he will take revenge after all they had sold him into slavery in egypt
1508078 we cannot un write the past but we can redeem that past
1508079 and we jews and christians who have worked so hard and so effectively at reconciliation must show the world another way honoring humanity as gods image protecting the environment as gods work respecting diversity as gods will and keeping the covenant as gods word

1508138 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing the cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq

1508142 its not a matter of how long were in iraq its if we succeed or not
1508143 for example one can dislike all christians because they think the worship of sanctification of a guy on a cross not to be offensive here is stupid
1508144 you are in effect not unfairly associating an individual with a loosely conceived social construct but attacking them for what they are by definition
1508145 so the fact of the matter is that racial bigotry is not about disliking someone because they are born with a certain skin color and sexism is not about thinking women inferior because they are born with no y chromosome
1508146 so say one dislikes all religion because one thinks the belief in a higher power to be stupid
1508147 as ive pointed out in my post racism and sexism and all those affiliated isms are defined by the imposition of an identity on someone who may or may not agree with what youve just assigned them
1508148 but i want to make clear that im not defending antipathy towards a religion or even an ideology simply trying to clarify that it is not comparable to the kind of bigotry discussed by phoebe and certainly not for any reason related to genetic inheritance
1508149 its an opportunity to be active have something to do

1508153 i think they get a little scared to go up against me

1508160 laid the foundations for what we can begin to recognize as the modern presidency
1508161 more elected representatives there were the more likely the popular will would be frustrated
1508162 no longer compatible with our dignity and our oath of making the constitution respected
1508163 that we may secure the permanent enjoyment of the former is it wise in such a moment to sacrifice the spirit of the laws to the letter and by adhering too strictly to the letter lose the substance forever in order that we may for an instant preserve the shadow
1508164 are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated
1508165 no law of the united states authorizing a trial before a military court for offences such as are alleged
1508166 contrary of the forms and usages of the army and without regard to the finding of that court which had been instituted as a guide for himself
1508167 was never before received against the accused in any court of this country
1508168 was unwilling to move forward with annexation because he worried that sectional divisions over slavery would complicate the election of his chosen successor martin van buren
1508169 left the matter to congress to decide as under the constitution it controlled the acquisition of new territory and the admission of states
1508170 part of the executive power over foreign relations jackson was no different
1508171 he alone negotiates into the field of negotiation the senate cannot intrude and congress itself is powerless to invade it
1508172 on this important and delicate branch of our future negotiations would enable the president to act much more effectively in the exercise of his particular functions there is also the best reason to believe that measures in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the treaty making power would be more satisfactory to the american people and to the indians
1508173 the opinion of the judges has no more authority over congress than the opinion of congress has over the judges and on that point the president is independent of both
1508174 such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve
1508175 the first president to make use of the pocket veto
1508176 unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case it shall not be a law
1508177 because of jackson any modern president with the support of thirty four senators can completely stall any proposed legislation
1508178 believed it was his constitutional right to decide how to carry out federal law such as the statute on the deposit of federal funds in order to execute the law he had to control subordinate officials in the executive branch

1508189 hey ive got a question for you since you know about these kinds of things
1508190 in fantasy art how do those chainmail bras manage to hold up those enormous hooters
1508191 when i saw them i thought great this place is gonna go downhill
1508192 he said you know this is my ministry not yours
1508193 its just somewhere i can go where i dont have to worry about people trying to pressure me to do things i dont want to do
1508194 pretty much whenever they show up we open the doors
1508195 its not so much im going through drug addictions too can you help me
1508196 when you look at our churchs history it really started on the basis of mingling with people sympathizing with them meeting their needs and winning their confidence and then making them disciples not the other way around
1508197 know why youre doing it ive never seen a ministry start in genuine sincerity and not be successful
1508198 if youre just trying to build a church get recognition or feel good about yourself thats not in the interest of the community
1508199 traditionally adventists have been very passive weve tended to proclaim a come and see attitude
1508200 we are now learning to be more proactive to go and help instead
1508201 there are many ways but i am convinced we have to meet peoples needs jesus said i came here to serve as christians what more can we do
1508202 we need to plant more ministries and grow churches from them not plant churches and think maybe ministry will happen
1508203 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1508204 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1508205 he voted against fuel efficiency standards for cars he opposed legislation to provide tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against solar power against wind power against biofuels against an energy bill that despite its flaws represented the largest investment in renewable energy in the history of this country he was dr no
1508206 barack obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy and it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1508207 a political maneuver to distract from his record of supporting george bush 90 percent of the time
1508208 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president

1508210 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time
1508211 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1508212 i think its a very well done and justifiable recommendation
1508213 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1508214 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1508215 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1508216 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1508217 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1508218 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1508219 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1508220 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
1508221 you dont ever want to jeopardize their long term health youre talking about a 22 year old kid
1508222 dr andrews is a pretty renowned doctor so a lot of guys go see dr andrews and well see what comes of it
1508223 we hope that we dont miss him very long and well get him back on the mound as soon as he can
1508224 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1508225 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1508226 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1508227 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1508228 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1508229 i looked up and there were shingles wood and everything up in the air i knew right away it was a tornado
1508230 our new estimate shows that the epidemic is and has been worse than we previously knew
1508231 we now know that hiv infections were never as low as forty thousand per year we estimate that about fifty thousand infections occurred per year in the early 1990s says hall
1508232 these estimates are a wakeup call for us all we need to do more as individuals as communities and as a nation to increase testing and also to increase prevention efforts
1508233 i can understand a smoking ban in a restaurant but a bar
1508234 typically id have a descent run from 5 oclock til 7 or 8 oclock now after 45 minutes of having a beer theyll go out back and have a smoke occassionally they come back in or occasionally they just go back home
1508235 at first there were complaints but theyre getting use to the idea thats the way its going to be with state government like they say its a smoking issue its a health thing but its also a rights issue
1508236 i pay taxes in this business and theyre telling me what i can and cant do in the building but i dont believe thats right
1508237 i dont have enough business to hire two people so i have to trust the people who are in here just tell one of the customers if the phone rings could you get it luckily its a small community that we trust everyone around here
1508238 i dont think this shelter will be appreciated until it is shut down
1508239 were waiting were waiting on other grants to come through but if those dont come through were basically looking at shutting down at the end of august
1508240 and the way federal funding is in this day and age everyone is applying for it and not everyone is getting it
1508241 the need is evident in the fact that the shelter is always full to overflowing and some women and children are turned away because there just isnt room for them
1508242 many roads around here we use them to get people into new homes and businesses and we want to make sure we can get to those businesses
1508243 anything that we have to do to stop our vehicle doesnt save us time and backs up traffic
1508244 when they are going through a roundabout they have to slow down to at least 20 mph when they are entering the roundabout and in a traditional intersection traffic could be at 40 mph
1508245 for me reducing crime is the natural byproduct of knowing your neighbors
1508246 i want to know my neighbors i want my neighbors to know each other and then all the things fall into place
1508247 we got games for the children games for the adults and were gonna come and eat
1508248 its a chance to get to know your neighbors and to encourage each other then as a byproduct were gonna reduce crime and maintain our neighborhood
1508249 i was diagnosed on new years eve of all things
1508250 there was quite a definitive article about breast cancer in general and diagnosis and it suggested mri
1508251 its the most sensitive way of diagnosing invasive breast cancer that we have
1508252 like in screening where people have either the breast cancer gene or a strong family history of breast cancer we use it to evaluate the extent of the breast cancer we call it staging of the breast cancer
1508253 i wanted to know for sure that the other breast the non operative breast didnt have some cells gathering at the time that would eventually turn into breast cancer too
1508254 because mine is lobular i will have more mris more breast mris just to make sure
1508255 the other this is to make sure that any valuables are hidden or not left in the car
1508256 youre not going to be able to take your radio out every time so that makes it a little more difficult but you just want to make your car as visible as you can and make sure the doors are locked
1508257 whether theyre in a house outside or driving by somebody sees the suspects getting into cars and knows theyre not supposed to be there and then they call us
1508258 why did you do this to me why did you leave me like that
1508259 no ten amos casa y dorm amos en la furgoneta hice all tercero de primaria me acuerdo mucho de la profesora me quer a mucho le gustaban mis dibujos

1508274 la estrategia del odio fue calando y dio muchos votos a la liga y a la derecha

1508276 les obligaron a salir de las chabolas y los pusieron en fila a contemplar la destrucci n
1508277 nos dijeron que no pod amos recoger nuestras cosas porque con el nuevo gobierno ya no bamos a poder seguir en italia
1508278 estuvimos unos d as durmiendo en la casa de caridad y roberto nos mand a n poles
1508279 las mujeres contaban que pasaron mucho miedo se acercaba gente a las ventanas y nos gritaba fuera de aqu z ngaros iros a vuestro pa s
1508280 primero dibuj a roberto me dijo que era una artista hice otros m s los puso en su p gina web y me dieron el premio y esta medalla
1508281 eran los mismos del d a anterior pero esa vez llevaban uniforme
1508282 me met en la tienda y me tap con la manta los polic as se llevaron a pap y empezaron a pegarle le o a gritar muy fuerte
1508283 cuando el estado maltrata as a la gente lo que consigue es que surja la solidaridad
1508284 la historia de los covaciu prueba que no tenemos una pol tica de integraci n

1508344 the primary justification often given for partial feeds that it will drive higher clickthroughs back to the publishers site is off base as people subscribe to feeds they subscribe to more feeds and that means theyre consuming more content which means that each click out of the feed reader is taking the reader away from more content in other words feed reading is consumption oriented not transactionally focused weve seen no evidence that excerpts on their own drive higher clickthroughs

1508369 its the only way i get the freedom to make the games i want to make
1508370 love it or hate it i have developed my own style and this is the only way to pursue that with absolute purity
1508371 hang on a minute i want to make games for myself
1508372 thats rubbish design when i knew there was something good in there and they were just being too cautious
1508373 as long as i get to run things it works out well being left alone to make games on my own
1508374 it s been vastly upgraded and is now useful for freeing me from needing external artwork
1508375 it would be incredible if we could make a game and procedurally create an experience though the parameters that we put on it
1508376 get it out to them get them to feel it bring it back and take the lessons into the next thing
1508377 to be honest i dont think it s quite enough to sustain my business
1508378 i can have a game open in an ie window i know the limitations and have to optimize things that you did in the 8 bit days
1508379 at the end of the day you can t please everyone
1508380 there will always be people on the internet who will moan and tell you you re rubbish and your game is gong to be terrible but you just have to shut them out and trust that it s going to be good
1508381 i think if you ve got it youve got it
1508382 if you try a bit of this and a bit of that you end up with thirty half done games and if you never complete then you ll never get the feeling that you can actually make games
1508383 it would be like ford saying we re going to release a car on paper make it and release it without testing and refining its elements
1508384 you can keep updating your game my game is a number of iterations along from its initial release we take our own stats so we can monitor most of the stuff you can do post launch is refinement based on the data coming back
1508385 i would say that the last year has been really hard
1508386 i tend to say a bit separate from those things
1508387 i try to keep true to what s in my head
1508388 ive got a job to do and i intend to keep doing it
1508389 is her sentiment to that by paying tribute to the rebelious artists that have helped inspire her and using probably one of the greatest loves in music history to express a longing for that personal connection between her character and the man she loves
1508390 is another great example as heidi sings as a woman who is speaking out loud to her ex who left her for another woman and asking him how it feels now that he has lost her for the love of another is it as good or does it haunt him every night
1508391 which takes heidis self imposed stereotype as a fast paced performance artist and turns it completely around to show off her very delicate and effective romantic side a side that made up a great deal of the glory that there was in trick ponys albums
1508392 is also very fast paced and ads a nice comedic twist to the end of the work
1508393 which basically sums up newfields decision to go solo the path she took to get here and the devotion she has to making her fans her family and herself as proud as ever through nothing more than a few good songs
1508394 ogni volta che ci dicono perch non protestavate quando la camorra sversava i rifiuti tossici io salto dalla sedia ma come negli anni 80 facevamo i presidi di notte rischiando la vita per bloccare i camion che lavoravano per la criminalit organizzata come pensate che siano nate tante inchieste dellantimafia
1508395 poi negli anni 90 mi feci da parte le delusioni erano state tante la frustrazione cresceva e anche la sfiducia nei partiti e nelle organizzazioni per cui militavo ho iniziato a pensare a me alla mia famiglia ma nel 2007 non ho potuto restare indifferente di fronte al fatto che volevano riaprire la discarica di terzigno nel parco nazionale del vesuvio che noi siamo riusciti a far chiudere 15 anni fa ed eccomi qui ancora a protestare solo che stavolta lo stato non pi dalla nostra parte oggi lottiamo contro i decreti dei commissari speciali e del governo contro leggi che contravvengono alla costituzione e allordinamento europeo
1508396 ho preso parte a quella che chiamerei fase 1 dellattuale emergenza allora gi subodoravo che il commissariamento non sarebbe servito a risolvere la situazione ma anzi a peggiorarla nel 1995 con la giunta regionale di antonio rastrelli di an ho visto il prevalere del consociativismo lemergenza offriva ai partiti la possibilit di trasformare una situazione di disoccupazione strutturale in una larga rete di clientelismi io stesso presi parte allemanazione del primo bando di formazione per operatori ecologici che poi port allassunzione di 2 500 persone regione provincia e comune aggirarono il collocamento e scelsero i corsisti anche tra liste di disoccupati create allultimo minuto con evidente infiltrazione della camorra che comprava gli elenchi dei nomi da gruppi gi esistenti fu una spartizione tra destra e sinistra divisa in quartieri e aree secondo le esigenze di ciascun partito che ne guadagn bacini di voti con questa prima manovra siamo arrivati ad avere oggi in campania 12 000 addetti alla raccolta dei rifiuti cio 1 ogni 400 abitanti mentre la media italiana 1 ogni 9 000
1508397 nel 1998 presi parte ad un corso di formazione di 1 500 ore per la raccolta differenziata nel 2000 fummo assunti dallasia eravamo in 2300 ma di cui solo 150 in possesso della qualifica gli altri provenivano da lavori socialmente utili cassa integrazione e mobilit era una politica di assorbimento della disoccupazione in 8 anni quelli come me che hanno la qualifica non sono mai stati utilizzati per la differenziata io ad esempio spazzo le strade quel poco di differenziata che oggi si fa a napoli il 10 la fanno i dipendenti generici dellattuale organico di 2 200 dipendenti asia solo la met sta in strada gli altri ricoprono livelli superiori e mansioni dufficio autista capogruppo ispettore etc quindi quando si dice che lasia ha un eccesso di dipendenti si dice una mezza verit gli addetti alla pulizia gli operatori ecologici siamo in pochi molti dei promossi sono i delegati sindacali il che spiega perch lazienda possa fare quello che vuole con le promozioni e i turni di lavoro lazienda interessata solo alla raccolta dei rifiuti tal quale perch deve rispettare gli appalti esterni cio consegnare limmondizia nei centri di raccolta fino a ieri gestiti dalla fibe questo conviene pure ai dipendenti perch lavoro fatto di notte con gli straordinari e un turno di riposo in mezzo ma in cambio devono garantire che quando c emergenza vanno e raccolgono ogni tipologia di rifiuti senza dare problemi la corte dei conti ha messo sotto inchiesta lazienda per i milioni di ore di straordinari pagati dopo averla gi condannata per non aver fatto la differenziata perdendo soldi dalla mancata vendita dei materiali riciclabili gli appalti esterni sembrano essere la cosa pi importante per lazienda tutto avviene allesterno riparazione automezzi pezzi di ricambio guardiania pulizia degli uffici e via dicendo fino allanno scorso noi venivamo prelevati ogni mattina dai nostri distretti e portati nelle strade da spazzare a bordo di autobus di lusso quelli a due piani la gente ci vedeva arrivare come dei turisti ma con la scopa e la divisa non credeva ai propri occhi questo perch avevano appaltato il trasporto dei dipendenti ad unazienda amica credo che siano tutte aziende amiche quelle che ottengono gli appalti asia
1508398 ogni volta arrivano prima i soldi e poi il commissario
1508399 il nome del comitato ricorda il giorno nel 2004 in cui una marcia pacifica di circa 30 000 cittadini che protestavano contro lapertura del cantiere per linceneritore furono caricate violentemente dalle forze dellordine ci furono numerosi feriti tra cui donne e bambini anche se per uno strano accordo sottobanco nessuno denunci nessuno in quanto polizia e carabinieri dissero di aver reagito contro un gruppetto che lanciava pietre ma leffetto della repressione stato quello di spaventare molti dei miei concittadini e ridurre la partecipazione della gente qui dagli anni 70 abbiamo lo stabilimento chimico della montefibre che ha gi procurato gravi danni allambiente adesso si aggiunger anche linceneritore dal 1999 denunciamo questa inutile mostruosit allinizio ci sentivamo soli eravamo una comunit abbandonata a se stessa oggi invece sentiamo intorno a noi una forte solidariet quando ho visto che anche napoli aveva i suoi comitati contro gli inceneritori mi sono detta allora vedi eravamo nel giusto
1508400 e che noi con le nostre proteste non siamo mai riuscite a bloccare linceneritore abbiamo portato alla luce la questione questo s ma la protezione delle forze dellordine intorno al cantiere stata tale che non siamo mai nemmeno riusciti ad avvicinarci si sono bloccati da soli perch hanno sbagliato il progetto la zona in cui hanno iniziato a costruire chiamata pantano per labbondanza di acque gli ha ostacolato i lavori poi intervenuta la magistratura che ha messo sotto inchiesta la fibe ed oggi limpianto giace l per nostra fortuna ancora incompleto
1508401 nel 2002 con altri colleghi abbiamo vinto un concorso indetto dal wwf per valorizzare la selva di chiaiano si tratta di 500 ettari di bosco con aree coltivate a bosco di castagno ciliege e piene di vie dacqua anni fa in una tenuta situata nella selva furono rinvenute delle scorie tossiche che poi la magistratura ha appurato provenissero dalla base nato di bagnoli una mattina mentre facevamo i rilievi per il nostro progetto trovammo centinaia di sacchi pieni di bustine vuote che erano servite da contenitori per fosfati cera ancora lindirizzo stabilimento miralanza di venezia quando ho saputo della scelta della discarica mi sono chiesto come riusciranno visti i volumi di spazzatura di cui parlano a far venire qui 300 camion al giorno che tra andata e ritorno fanno 600 autoveicoli in pratica uno ogni 2 minuti e mezzo nellarco di 24 ore le strade attuali sono impensabili per questo scopo ci sarebbe bisogno di infrastrutture viarie che certamente non si possono attuare nei tempi che il governo berlusconi ha dichiarato come termine dellemergenza rifiuti
1508402 vuoi un esempio delle speculazioni sullemergenza rifiuti la fibe proprietaria di una cava allinterno della selva che come si legge sugli atti della commissione parlamentare fu comprata nel 2001 da un intermediario per 200 milioni di lire e rivenduta a quella societ per 2 miliardi e mezzo che fiducia possiamo avere noi in chi ci propone lapertura della discarica gi nel 2001 ci fu una forte protesta a chiaiano contro il progetto di sversare nella cava della fibe della frazione organica allora nacque un comitato che poi stato alla base dellinizio delle proteste attuali
1508403 i politici tutti hanno detto solo bugie paolo russo parlamentare di forza italia che stato anche presidente della commissione sui rifiuti una settimana prima delle scorse elezioni disse ad un convegno che la discarica di chiaiano non si sarebbe mai fatta una settimana dopo ad un altro convegno ha affermato il contrario quando ci fu il collegamento in diretta da chiaiano con la trasmissione anno zero una donna girava con un manifesto di alcuni mesi prima firmato da alleanza nazionale e forza italia in cui si diceva che la discarica qui era un progetto folle voleva mostrarlo allonorevole mantovano di an che stava negli studi della rai non ne ebbe il tempo perch i politici locali di centrodestra la trascinarono via dissimulando che in quelloccasione non era giusto che comparissero dei simboli di partiti
1508404 che gran parte dei tecnici del commissariato sono ex allievi di ortolani e de medici e grazie a loro due che la discarica non ancora stata aperta ribattono colpo su colpo alle scempiaggini che vengono dette ma la verit che queste analisi hanno solo un carattere politico listituto di geologia ha gi tutti i rilievi fatti per legge negli anni passati
1508405 ma la corte costituzionale pu intervenire solo dopo che si siano verificati dei casi concreti cio dopo che qualcuno di noi venga arrestato
1508406 te lo dico io ci sono i giacobini perch questa lassise gli ultimi giacobini ditalia sono loro a scendere in campo quando la democrazia viene violata e qui in campania questo accade da 14 anni hanno competenze scientifiche giuridiche e culturali sono i figli di domenico cirillo e cento altri se li avessero ascoltati prima non saremmo arrivati al punto in cui siamo
1508407 i giacobini si trovarono il popolo contro e nacque una cesura storica tra gli intellettuali liberali e la citt che stata causa di tanti mali oggi questi giacobini sono al fianco di un popolo che non vuole pi essere oppresso e loccasione per cambiare qualcosa dobbiamo sfruttarla

1508425 i think what we are likely to be seeing is another sharp push up in the next quarter and the quarter after that were only a year into this credit crunch weve still got another 18 months to get to 2010 so its hard to see why those numbers wont go up in a relatively steep line
1508426 there are those contractors that are well placed on public and private sector frameworks which are securing reasonable volumes through those arrangements
1508427 then there are firms outside of that which are operating in a decreasing pool of open market tenders typified by very competitive bidding
1508428 the housebuilding industry has been buoyant and weve been under pressure to try to up our game and do more and more for our client base so weve tried to concentrate on that and paid less heed to the local authority work

1508433 everything hinges on the revenues definition of a property developer
1508434 if you buy a property then rip out the kitchen before letting it that can class you as a developer and you fall within the cis scheme
1508435 its a grey area at the moment and likely to remain that way for some time
1508436 contractors carrying out the work are at risk if the revenue finds that the work should have been carried out within the scope of cis they could face fines or losing some part of the contract value
1508437 ordinary buy to let landlords are not within the scope of cis unless they are building or re developing buildings as part of that business

1508449 the saturn 12 footer i bought from you is the most fun boat weve ever had over the last 35 years it turns heads every time were out on the water with it and folks always stop for a closer look at the boat ramp and ask a lot of questions about it another great thing to mention is how easy it is to paddle the boat in either direction it just glides across the water i also bought a 9 8 nissan four stroke for this boat and swear you couldnt burn 3 gallons of gas in it in an entire day had to take it out in the ocean just to try it out and it was more fun then i could ever imagine completely safe and super stable big boat wakes in the intercostals waterway are a snap with this boat ran it once with just my 210 lbs in it and it was scary fast lol with the wife and i in it it runs about 16 18 knots at full plane using half throttle really and exceptional boat

1508495 the dirty tactics used by those who infiltrated the national party conference at the weekend and secretly bugged mps personal conversations are disgusting
1508496 i call on helen clark to say whether she condones or condemns these tactics
1508497 is this what she meant when she told labour activists recently to put on their hard hats
1508498 the contrast between the two major parties is revealing national is focused on what really matters to new zealanders at our weekend conference we outlined our 10 point blueprint to build a stronger future for new zealand
1508499 at the same time the labour party is showing they have no plans for the future and no vision beyond descending to the lowest level to cling on to power
1508500 helen clark needs to tell the country whether the level of dirty tactics now being revealed is what we can expect from her party up the election
1508501 this fool copernicus wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy but sacred scripture in joshua 10 13 tells us that joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth

1508513 to separate adult men from the pre pubescent boys the youngsters were examined and if they had grown any pubic hair it was enough to behead them
1508514 only one of their women was killed she was actually with me and was talking with me and laughing immoderately as the apostle was killing her man in the market when suddenly an unseen voice called her name good heavens i cried what is the matter i am to be killed she replied what for i asked because of something i did she answered she was taken away and beheaded
1508515 i shall never forget my wonder at her good spirits and her loud laughter when all the time she knew that she would be killed
1508516 no woman of banu tribe qurayzah was killed except one she was with me talking and laughing on her back and belly extremely while the apostle of allah was killing her people with the swords suddenly a man called her name where is so and so i asked what is the matter with you she said i did a new act aisha said the man took her and beheaded her aisha said i will not forget that she was laughing extremely although she knew that she would be killed

1508558 the city of champlain and laval a city of explorers and saints the cradle of evangelization in north america a eucharistic city which has hosted some weeks ago the 49th international eucharistic congress
1508559 the presence of the ark of the new covenant in our midst symbolizes the renewed eucharistic commitment we are invited to promote in the life of the church the great success of the congress was due to the prayer and involvement of many actors and benefactors among which i tell you sincerely the knights of columbus were the most committed organization at all levels
1508560 the love stemming from the eucharist is able to foster hope reconciliation and peace
1508561 as an international catholic fraternity the knights of columbus have a special role to play in witnessing the love of christ in todays world under the wise leadership of pope benedict the xvi
1508562 despite the cultural opposition to this church teaching we are called to revisit this document and to realize how prophetic it was and still is
1508563 in holiness on the personal level and to be present as a social body on the public scene particularly by promoting the values of the family among which the sacredness of human life from the moment of conception to the last breath of natural death
1508564 it is not easy to embody those values in todays context especially in canada where the culture of death is making further steps of domination by rewarding publicly an activist of abortion
1508565 wake up and to hear the word of the lord do not be afraid when the storm hits the boat come to me and hold firm my hand the hand of the church

1508571 the majority of english bishops believe that it has been a good conference there has been real listening and real hearing
1508572 there are no instant solutions to the big difficulties but there is a commitment to stay together and work on it
1508573 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
1508574 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
1508575 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time
1508576 we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
1508577 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
1508578 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
1508579 victoria rue is not a validly ordained priest of the roman catholic church members of the roman catholic church should not participate in celebrations of the sacraments that are conducted by victoria rue as those celebrations are not in union with the local or universal church
1508580 women have been thought of as evil sinful and lustful as representing only the body and not the spirit

1508582 my biggest belief is that the church will change because the spirit is within the people and outside the people and larger than the people the spirit will move and something will change
1508583 i believe the community jesus founded was a community in which there was a table men and women old and young people on the margins of society all were welcome at the table

1508591 with the tenacity typical of the people of the mountains this generous witness of love gave himself to the chinese people of southern shandong for love and with love he embraced the conditions of their life
1508592 having been announced a bit in advance it has become an event not only for the private devotion of the holy father but also for the local people
1508593 he went through a process of learning about and appreciating chinese culture
1508594 the possibility of understanding one another of dialogue and of bringing a spiritual message to china with full respect for the extraordinary culture of this great country
1508595 we know that there will be three churches in beijing in which it will be possible to pray and to attend mass and we know that the bishops of macao and hong kong are invited to the olympic games
1508596 the fact that the pope desires to honour this great missionary figure a missionary to china which is a subject very much present nowadays in the popes prayers is something that should unite catholics
1508597 we therefore confess that the sacrifice of the mass is and ought to be considered one and the same sacrafice as that of the cross for the victim is one and the same namely christ our lord who offerred himself once only a bloody sacrifice on the altar of the cross

1508613 it makes the defendant much more likely to cooperate because ultimately what we are looking for is information about who the other gang members are and the structure and organizations of the gang
1508614 any additional help we can get as to what the gangs are involved in and who the players are is a definite asset to us all
1508615 with their enhanced sentencing theyre a major part in the fight against gang violence that we have here in the city
1508616 we are definitely making more than just a dent we are taking some serious offenders off the streets but the problem is still getting worse

1508632 we did not talk of the privileges of the bishop of rome we merely indicated the praxis for future debate
1508633 we will have to return to the role of the bishop of rome in the universal church during the first millennium
1508634 there was an inter orthodox problem over the recognition of the autonomous church of estonia
1508635 and we cannot interfere yet we are extremely sad and concerned because it is important to us that the russian orthodox church should also participate in our future dialogue
1508636 we can also facilitate this solution either at the bilateral level between moscow and constantinople or at the pan orthodox level but there is not doubt that we want the russian orthodox church to anticipate it is a very important church we do not want to dialogue without the russians and we wish to work to achieve this aim
1508637 popular culture is the culture which originates from the people

1508650 ex hibit s a passionate attachment between the sexes that rises above the merely physical the vogue of the sentimental love novel was one of the features of the romantic movement and the form maintained a certain moving dignity despite a tendency to excessive emotional posturing
1508651 is a willful disregard for the health and safety of those using the facilities
1508652 the three universities have identified the repairs that are critical for the health and safety of the students faculty and employees
1508653 i have read that asu plans to use its funds to address all of its identified fire life safety issues shockingly the u of a and nau plan to address only some of their critically needed repairs
1508654 any life safety issues will be dealt with forthwith and there will be no students threatened at any way because of a lack at any of the three universities taking care of their deferred maintenance
1508655 that means ua isnt fixing 17 million of life safety issues
1508656 the speaker is saying we just gave you a billion dollars the universities have identified 328 million worth of fire and life safety issues why is that not a first priority
1508657 putting the lives of students at risk so they can do cosmetic renovation
1508658 examined all deferred maintenance needs and education needs and there will be no fire and life safety issues that wont be addressed
1508659 just because u get along with a girl doesnt mean you should date her
1508660 i might the girl i am super in love with but i also could name a couple other girls that i think are great women in their own right and if so and so didnt exist well maybe
1508661 what we are really saying is no one that i could actually see myself with is interested ive got tons of great good looking nice guy friends but i wouldnt date them because it just wouldnt be right its not a good fit i would just be dating them so i wouldnt be alone that doesnt mean they arent fantastic guys but i know that im not something special to them really im just an option
1508662 so youre waiting for a guy who does not see you as
1508663 yes but even then a guy could see me as something special and i may not reciprocate or there have been times where i have been totally into the guy but have not pursued it because i knew it wouldnt work out we made great friends but we would never have made it as a couple just because u get along with a girl doesnt mean you should date her
1508664 he said mama im having the best day in my life

1508666 she just lost her best friend really and her brother you know
1508667 he joined the air force because whitehall is a small town and theres really not much here
1508668 when you first meet spencer hes got like just a way of making you fall in love with him
1508669 he makes you feel like youre his best friend the minute you meet him
1508670 spencer said ill sign up if you hang out with us later
1508671 he would just get up and dance and sing to me in the middle of a store
1508672 he liked to be the center of attention he was a big clown
1508673 from when he was a little kid next door to when i gave him a big hug at graduation there was a smile there was fun
1508674 he would be driving down the road and see something and start making rhymes and they were ridiculous
1508675 he was that guy in the huddle that would get everybody fired up
1508676 i guess us boys were just going to hang out and watch movies
1508677 while our dialogue has led to significant agreement on the understanding of ministry the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
1508678 we should keep in mind what is at stake as we proceed to speak about faithfulness to the apostolic tradition and apostolic succession when we speak about the threefold ministry womens ordination and moral commandments what we are talking about is nothing other than our faithfulness to christ himself
1508679 over the past 40 years we have not only engaged jointly in theological dialogue a close working relationship between anglicans and catholics has grown not only on an international level but also in many regional and local contexts
1508680 this leaves me all the more saddened as i have now in fidelity to what i believe christ requires and i want add in the frankness which friendship allows to look to the problems within the anglican communion which have emerged and grown since the last lambeth conference and to the ecumenical repercussions of these internal tensions
1508681 on the level of the anglican communion of 44 regional and national member churches each self governing independence without sufficient interdependence has now become a critical issue
1508682 the episcopate is one each part of which is held by each one for the whole bishops are the sign and the instrument of unity within the individual local church just as they are between both the contemporary local churches and those of all times within the universal church
1508683 but in several contexts bishops are not in communion with other bishops in some instances anglican provinces are no longer in full communion with each other
1508684 i know that many of you are troubled some deeply so by the threat of fragmentation within the anglican communion
1508685 in a previous statement it was noted that anglicans could agree with catholics that homosexual activity is disordered but that we might differ in the moral and pastoral advice we would offer to those seeking our counsel
1508686 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
1508687 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
1508688 the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
1508689 the catholic church must now take account of the reality that the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate is not only a matter of isolated provinces but that this is increasingly the stance of the communion
1508690 while our dialogue has led to significant agreement on the understanding of ministry the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
1508691 we have confidence that with gods help you will find a way out of these difficulties and that in a new and fresh manner we will be strengthened in our common pilgrimage toward the unity jesus christ wills for us and prayed for
1508692 we hope and pray that as you seek to walk as faithful disciples of jesus christ the father of all mercies may bestow upon you the abundant riches of his grace and guide you with the holy spirits abiding presence
1508693 weve had some pretty big changes over the last few years
1508694 weve got less pollution going into the air and ultimately that means cleaner air for us to breathe
1508695 were better but it wont stay that way unless we continue to make improvements and make reductions
1508696 i told you the campaign should be called good and pawlenty
1508697 the bizarre circumstances in which mr chin became a quadriplegic a fall during a 1999 sex orgy with a transsexual were also aired in court
1508698 this is the generation that went from love is all you need to whoever dies with the most toys wins

1508701 the burning river fest left started out in the brewery
1508702 we saw it as a celebration of different environmental groups and exploring their functions and reasons for being we always wanted to bring it outside but probably should have always had the festival on the water whiskey island and voinovich park have hosted the event in the past but were cumbersome when it came to parking with nautica we think weve found a location that will bring a lot of people out to receive that sustainability message and engage
1508703 there are 3000 parking spaces infrastructure utilities and more at nautica
1508704 it seemed like a more perfect fit as a venue minimizing costs of all the things that go into producing the festival
1508705 if you wait for the government to make choices for you about these things you might wait forever
1508706 we see more diversity organic farmers award winning beers and a lecture series on lakefront development water quality and vendors dealing green apparel and supplies as very appealing
1508707 a more cyclical approach to business instead of a linear one
1508708 knowing not to get too big too soon you dont want to start shipping your product all over the country not knowing how its being stored or handled proof as a good business practice and being adamant about customer satisfaction has always served us well and if we ever falter theres always hope that we can win back a customers affection with good customer service reaching out to people has helped us a great deal and most people appreciate that
1508709 w e were initially appluauded for the companys efforts to take care of the staff customers appreciated the food and beer tasting better lower dry cleaning bills and a sparkling establishment instead of one coated with nicotine in the end it was a calculated risk to support something that radical at the time but our customers understand where were coming from our base is often supporting our sustainable messages and like to think of alternative strategies on how to change the world you can be environmental stewards and still be profitable politicians often want to make that an eiter or proposition
1508710 great cucumbers onions and fresh herbs and theyll be a part of the menu at the pub until the end of the harvest
1508711 learning where the food comes from harvest to table is an incredible culinary experience for our staff with the cost of petrol and transportation these days theres a pendulum swinging and people are beginning to look local for more of their everyday products including food
1508712 the idea was to base it on the existing dortmunder its everything the dort is but just more of it
1508713 were thinking about future anniversary products but the response has been so great that we would not be surprised if it did not come back but it is still an open book issue at present
1508714 in mid 1990s when we were able to expand footprint beyond original brew pub and into the other buildings that really helped us control our future expansion was a critical point and had we not been able to secure real estate in the manner we did we might not have bene able to grow as we did
1508715 we could also talk about our first gold medals earned their flagship dortmunder gold struck gold at the 1990 great american beer festival and in the mid 1990s we were named microbrewery of the year that emerging beyond cleveland was big for us
1508716 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
1508717 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
1508718 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in the next stages
1508719 much in the gafcon documents is consonant with much of what we have sought to say and do and we need to look for the best ways of building bridges here
1508720 we did consider very seriously the possibility of a bishops and laity anglican congress or gathering in south africa half way between the last lambeth in 1998 and this one that proved extraordinarily difficult im very open to looking for larger scale anglican gatherings on the continent where the majority of anglicans actually are
1508721 we have not resolved the differences among us but have seen the deep need to maintain relationships even in the face of significant disagreement and discomfort
1508722 we are not talking about rights for the sake of the communion we are asking for sacrifice
1508723 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
1508724 i think this is not the last anglican conference but i do think it will be the last lambeth conference
1508725 the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide
1508726 i just saw that this wasnt a career and to get back in the military
1508727 in the marine corps we have a chow hall and in the air force we have a dining facility
1508728 my doctor asked me how long have i been smoking
1508729 i said i dont smoke and never had no one in my family smokes the only thing i could come up with is all the aircraft exhaust i had to be around while guarding troops and supplies coming into kuwait for the buildup of the iraqi freedom war

1508823 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1508824 it has been a dramatic bull story along with the commodity boom
1508825 the aussies fall is more a function of the rba than the us fed today
1508826 although downside risk to growth remains the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee

1508857 keep plugging away and it will slowly sometimes very slowly unfold for you your vision will begin to unblur and your purpose revealed
1508858 there was a judge that ruled for me and now its gone back and forth so well continue the fight
1508859 it would be our desire to have the written opinion from the appeals court but the order just says it will come in due course
1508860 it should have gone for me in the circuit court
1508861 they told me they were going to the supreme court with this and i hope they will but i wont believe it until i see it
1508862 have a very real and direct interest in the outcome of this particular prosecution
1508863 people just cant afford to eat out and we cant afford to keep paying bills from our own pockets
1508864 its like that saying youve got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
1508865 theyre what kept the doors open as long as they were
1508866 i know most everybody who comes through this door by name

1508871 the board has expressed support for rick wagoner and the gm management team on several occasions and that has not changed

1508873 im not sure changing horses mid stream is a good idea
1508874 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1508875 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1508876 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1508877 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1508878 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1508879 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1508880 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1508881 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1508882 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1508883 would you mind keeping an eye on my stuff i need some more coffee if im to try and get some work done here instead of back in the office
1508884 of course if you wouldnt mind doing the same when for me when you get back

1508890 silly on me not on you i just looked like someone who wanted to be a beautiful fairywitch in those clothes but they were just waiting to for you to come along and show them how they should be worn
1508891 maybe it fell off its legs and we didnt notice

1508907 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1508908 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go
1508909 weve had some close ones like that but that one was uncalled for
1508910 and then the giggling sometimes a collision happens and a defensive guys says hey man im sorry i didnt mean to hit you that hard and then they help each other up but then we had a bunch of gigglers over there that irritated the whole thing
1508911 almost was an offense vs defense little scuffle so we just put a quick end to it we wont practice against each other tonight and well try again tomorrow night
1508912 weve got to learn to practice as a team practice with teammates and we werent doing very well so we just shut it down and ran a whole bunch
1508913 and hopefully tomorrow night well come out and practice as a team take care of your teammates and not have a lot of giggling guys when somebody hits somebody so hopefully we learned something tonight

1508922 and the kids were at school and no one came to pick them up and no one took care of them
1508923 surely they have someones number to call in case of emergency
1508924 so if they called you from the school and said oh by the way david and sarahs mother has just been killed could you please come and collect them what would you do
1508925 look bibi id say yes certainly and id go and get them what do you think id do tell them i was busy and id try to get over there when i had a minute ask them to call around and see if there was anyone else who could take them
1508926 but what if they gave them to my mother what if something happened to me and they gave my kids to my parents
1508927 youd be worth more if they saw more of the stuff like that painting she has
1508928 with economic growth in asia looking far weaker than even the pessimists had dared to forecast the outlook for both the canadian dollar and commodity prices is not encouraging
1508929 we probably need the canadian dollar to be in the vicinity of 85 cents before you start to see a substantial impact on manufacturing competitiveness
1508930 we have to look back to august and september of 2007 when the canadian dollar traded at 95 5 cents u s to find some support to draw from
1508931 its not a particularly solid argument that the canadian dollar should decline with the drop in oil
1508932 i see it as a buying opportunity and that is what im advising my clients to do

1508968 religious people were indifferent or even hostile to science scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith
1508969 we are all culpable each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature
1508970 there is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change
1508971 religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities

1508995 i take my text tonight from a source familiar to us all but too easily forgotten in the heat of political battle for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul
1508996 my friends i have tried to serve my country all my life with honor and i will not trade that accomplishment for any office no matter how exalted
1508997 in the past months i have given in to the temptation to allow people who speak for me to paint my opponent as dishonest deceitful and untrustworthy from my own experience as his senate colleague i know that is simply not true
1508998 from this moment all that will stop in my heart i believe i am better qualified to lead this country and i will make my case to anyone who will listen but i will not be part of a process that demeans others for my own advantage and damages the civilized american dialogue that has been the glory of our democracy for more than two centuries

1509004 remember all those pictures of the london bombings of the tsunami of the monks in burma they were all taken by people who just happened to be there at the time and managed to snap a picture with their mobile phone or a camera
1509005 demotix takes absolutely no political stance except the right to freedom of speech and in many countries around the world we make freedom of speech available
1509006 because there are so few real journalists anymore the few still out there have to do many times more work what that means is simple they are forced to do it badly a cardiff university study of the four british broadsheets this one included found that they took up to half their news direct from press releases and it gets worse if you look here and the same roughly with the big four us newspapers too
1509007 and weve created what we hope is a dead simple site that allows people to upload news archival breaking cultural political sporting environmental plain strange search for it and comment on it
1509008 at base we are a kind of youtube for news at best we want to be the indispensable wire service pumping what we learn from our contributors back out to the mainstream media around the world
1509009 many of the posts i see on demotix verge on propaganda press releases whoever it is struggling against the oppressor or some sort of thing the true strength of a site like this can be on stories that are not about flashpoints and instead just tell the story of societies cultures and people around the world the originators are right there are billions of stories waiting to be related like google it becomes more interesting the more you have and the analysis tools used to appraise them personally i think it will sink in propaganda sludge but massive reporting of everyday stories can fight this trend wikipedia would be an analog for this
1509010 reuters and the associated press who have replaced the foreign correspondent everywhere provide a wire agency service to over 95 per cent of the worlds serious news media they are for most newspapers and broadcasters the only source of international news and amazingly they dont have a single staffer in 40 per cent of the worlds countries
1509011 they are not likely to tear apart organic material and so their presence does not limit the search for habitability in the icy soil of mars
1509012 the ability to talk to people who do the exact same thing you do is fantastic rarely are we talking to our peers on this kind of level
1509013 i have already established some relationships i have one business lead and just from a people perspective to have a resource in somebody that you can tap into and have a free and open discussion about best practices with is invaluable
1509014 i can help my younger employees to use their expertise of digital knowledge strategically
1509015 you have to make a conscious choice to take the time make the time to determine a vision and a plan in order to turn that vision into reality
1509016 take the time to work not just in your business but on your business
1509017 how do i become an effective leader knowing both what our employees want as well as our clients
1509018 a pr person is trained and skilled to tell clients how to think about things
1509019 coming to the counselors academy spring conference feels like coming back home
1509020 we are pleased to be able to offer our services to the government and look forward to working with secretary paulson and his team as they work to restore stability to the global capital markets and confidence in the u s housing market
1509021 clickmichelle would like this we need to oo and ahhhhhhhhhh over this
1509022 you have a company that used to post above the main line grocery stores now posting more in line with grocery so i think thats suggesting a share shift
1509023 the postponement calls are dead and buried the top concern now is peace and order i still discount it but you can never be sure we dont know what the moro islamic liberation front milf will do because of the tro
1509024 the milf will react very badly im sure theyll be angry hopefully no one will react violently
1509025 the flip side is that these fees have a cost
1509026 the presiding justice is simply given control and supervision over administrative affairs of the court
1509027 as far as congress is concerned we will do our job the senate will be answerable to the people of mindanao
1509028 they dont understand the implications the senate has no constituents in armm this is important as a manifestation of our sincere efforts in the peace process
1509029 wed like to send a message to the milf that they shouldnt get out of the talks because we are accommodating them
1509030 its the message that wed like to show especially from us muslim congressmen
1509031 there is almost no service for a pure ev so battery pack swaps which can be done in minutes while you wait might be about all you need brake pad replacement can be done by any shop
1509032 they should be allowed to transfer to schools near their family and friends when theyve done their time
1509033 in cobar teachers are facing transport problems especially those working in remote mining areas and it is particularly difficult for young teachers
1509034 we are expressing our support to our colleagues and we want to assure them that we understand their problems and hope that changes are implemented by the det
1509035 i guess the supreme court will have to rethink its decision on this because it can effectively kill the peace process
1509036 if we would do this all over again what government must do is to bring everyone in the loop meaning to say the supreme court and congress because the philippine government commits the whole state and not just the executive
1509037 i guess the supreme court made a decision based on the submissions and did not have the benefit of full briefing on the security political economic implications if this moa ad is not signed
1509038 if the talks break down because of this tro there are a lot of political ramifications and i think the sc was not fully informed about this
1509039 sub state for the bangsamoro in a defined territory in southern philippines
1509040 the moa ad is basically a road map it contains the intentions of the parties to have doable peace in mindanao and the subsequent legal and constitutional processes are still to be undertaken by the philippine government
1509041 theres really no irreparable damage or injury that needs to be prevented as to justify the issuance of the tro by the supreme court
1509042 the most important thing to remember is that what the moa ad commits with respect to the areas wherein zamboanga north cotabato people are protesting is basically an inclusion on the list but they will be asked sometime in the future within a year whether or not they would like to be part of the armm
1509043 will have serious ramifications in the security and stability in southern philippines
1509044 basically the ball is in the governments hands and this is internal to the grp
1509045 because as far as the milf is concerned this is a done deal already and what was scheduled today was a merely a formal ceremony to celebrate the signing of the moa ad
1509046 to seek constitutional change and reform e g shift to federalism has not been usually treated as unconstitutional except it seems when it has to do with the moro question
1509047 in fact it is even normal for peace processes as shown by the experience of many countries to seek and effect constitutional change and reform as needed for a negotiated political settlement
1509048 would entail changes in the existing legal including constitutional framework
1509049 it is to the credit of the grp side that it is now willing to effect constitutional change as needed as part of an overall solution to the bangsamoro problem
1509050 frame a qualitatively better and higher degree of self determination for the bangsamoro people short of independence or secession
1509051 these are peace negotiations not surrender negotiations between two sides which simply have different frameworks if not world views
1509052 as for the milf and for that matter the ndf have often said what point is there to these negotiations if their side will just accept the framework of the philippine constitution
1509053 had a local solicitor tendered and beat me on merits i would clearly have no complaint at all
1509054 i just think its outrageous that councillors should take a significant amount of funding out of the district
1509055 its a very big chunk of income to lose in an instant
1509056 its perhaps manageable over a five year period but to lose it instantly for no apparent reason its a huge financial burden
1509057 all tenders received by council in this matter were assessed by a three member independent tender assessment panel against the set selection criteria that was outlined in the tender specifications that were
1509058 i like the process and the support we get from the electoral commission is unbelievable
1509059 were putting them in place at the moment and weve had about 400 expressions of interest
1509060 what were doing is serious but we dont have to be we can celebrate at the end
1509061 weve been led to believe that prior to anything further happening in the area we would have the bypass
1509062 were disappointed that at this stage it appears the bypass has been postponed regardless of the development itself we consider the bypass was necessary years ago
1509063 working at the intersection of the business cultural and philanthropy sectors bringing design thinking and design processes to a host of social and environmental challenges
1509064 is there a definitive canadian style in our graphic design
1509065 we said this association supports our umpires 100 per cent and the umpires do not tolerate bad language on the court directed at the umpire or players
1509066 we said if this occurs the player will be asked to leave the court and take no further part in the competition until it has been fully investigated by the executive
1509067 the damage that can be done by purposeful swearing is dependent on how the receiver takes it
1509068 the bigger danger is the damage to the reputation of the sport or club
1509069 the culture in netball in the last 20 years has always been one of politeness you dont want that to change where parents say they dont want their daughter playing netball because of the swearing
1509070 swearing is creeping into society and now females swear as much as the men
1509071 and netball has a small court so you can hear everything thats said so i just want to say the council supports hawkesbury city netball associations stand against swearing
1509072 swearing is seen as an intimidatory tactic not just against officials but against other players they dont feel that what they do with the ball is enough
1509073 its lovely to hear hawkesbury is using the code of conduct
1509074 having the golf course is good for pitt town because they are doing up something to improve the land and landscape but i am not really in favour of medium density housing development
1509075 in one way it is good because i will have new customers so its positive for my business but on the other hand it is negative for the area the changes that are happening now have already affected my business
1509076 they should have been encouraging more agricultural production we bought this farm being a rural area and now its becoming like any other town
1509077 council says they are pro farming but i dont think they are because in the future this farm could be developed for housing as it has now been zoned as rural residential
1509078 council also advised that we cannot increase our sheds and we cannot add more birds so once we stop farming then thats it we cannot expand to meet the demands

1509117 i am not jose mourinho so why should people compare me with him
1509118 maybe if mourinho says he will win and then afterwards he doesnt that might cause problems because the manager is not playing its the players out on the pitch so if you say that and they make a mistake then you have to say its their fault
1509119 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise when people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cried for chelsea they loved chelsea its a big surprise people dont like us in england but chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan our history is not the same and you cant make history in two three or even 10 years but maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level

1509200 what a whirlwind it was although it sort of all transpired in 24 hours i went from being the stanley cup champion in edmonton to playing in los angeles it probably had been behind the scenes going on for three or four months it was just one of those things that at the end of the day as ive always said i miss the friends and people that i knew in edmonton but it was a great opportunity for me it opened up a lot of doors in going to california
1509201 the team picture itself was really ironic because what had happened in the past and i was really lucky to have been on four championship teams but for the previous three the ice was kind of helter skelter and you really couldnt move and it really became almost not fun so going to into the last game we really talked to security about keeping people off the ice and let the players enjoy that time and be able to share with each other and share it with the fans so the picture itself really happened because we were just out there alone i remember the old pictures of the 60s from montreal and toronto and i was like this is something special to have i didnt hear about anything regarding a possible trade until that next morning after we won the cup i was approached by somebody who said theres an opportunity here for you to be traded to vancouver and i about fell off my chair and thats when i first heard about it
1509202 well what happened was i had one more year on my contract and i would have been an unrestricted free agent i made it clear to peter pocklington and glen sather mostly peter that i was going to finish the year out and i had good reason as to why i wanted to finish the year out i really had no intentions at that point in time of leaving and stiffing the but i wanted to get paid fair market value i felt like i owed it to myself to do it and i felt like i really owed it to my teammates at that point in time there were guys making a million dollars plus and we were making 250 300 000 and i just thought from a business point of view that i needed to take that step as ive said to people i understand now why peter made his decision and he made a business decision too and i totally understand that
1509203 what had happened was peter had given permission basically to talk to whoever i wanted to and at the point in time i said look if im moving the only two places i want to go to would be los angeles or detroit and peter said fine and thats how i got involved my favorite team as a kid was detroit my dad wanted me to go to detroit but my gut was telling me there was a huge challenge in los angeles and i just really felt like it was the right thing to do in my heart thats all gut feel and i wound up in la
1509204 it was a combination of both peter made a good business decision he didnt want to take the chance of me not re signing the next year so he was going to get as many assets as he could including money so it was a good deal for peter as far as bruce was concerned he felt that if i can get this player im going to give them anything they want basically other than that he was steadfast that luc robitaille wasnt going to be apart of it so it was one of those deals that was good for both sides
1509205 well it was difficult because leading up to that part i kind of accepted the fact that something was going to happen but when it actually did happen i was probably in shock so walking in there glen pulled me aside sat with me for a good hour and tried to convince me and telling me that if we wanted to block the deal he could block the deal right then and there and it would end i spent a good hour talking to him and a had a good chat and i just felt from both sides point of view it was the right thing to do to keep moving forward unfortunately the people that suffered the most were probably the fans it was a great opportunity for me and something that i went on to really enjoy being a part of and the oilers ended up winning and getting enough players that they went on to win another stanley cup and i think thats when people started to get over the whole thing but my 10 years in edmonton its still home for me its still family its still fond memories
1509206 the morning of the press conference the only person who knew was craig simpson he was staying with me we planned this vacation together i knew it was coming down and so the day he arrived i had to tell him that it was probably going to happen in the next 24 hours so he knew and when it officially happened i talked to mark and kevin lowe and it was tough what was more difficult was when i did get traded the first day i was at training camp i remember that night calling friends and saying i didnt know what i did i went from one of the greatest hockey teams in history to a team that was 20th out of 21 last year and there was a big difference in talent and i dont mean that with any disrespect to the players that were there but you go from messier anderson kurri grant fuhr kevin lowe and that was a big eye opener for me
1509207 it was really hard because going in obviously i had some doubts is this the right thing to do why am i doing this etc etc and then after i went through the whirlwind of being there and everyone doing the best they could for that particular time and then it was sort of like this coming out of a rainstorm sort of when youre walking on the street and its raining and all of a sudden youre walking on a beautiful sunny day and thats basically how it felt it was sort of a black cloud over me and then when i got to la that night it was like a sunny night so it was a tough day
1509208 because it is home for me it always will be its a tough thing to go through you know ive said this many times when you play in edmonton you look around the arena and you see the same people in section 14 and row 10 and they become like friends almost so i spent 10 good years there and i like to think that i played hard every night and it was very enjoyable they treated me with nothing but respect and i like to think i played hard every night it was difficult leaving and i always say that still to this day i love going back there and visiting friends i still have great friends from those years
1509209 i was lucky i was part of it i knew it was part of my responsibility and i worked hard at it i was lucky enough to have guys like kelly hrudey and luc robitaille and marty mcsorley and they understood that too and they accepted that role and then lets face it i got a little bit lucky in that mr gund was a huge hockey fan put a team at that time in san francisco and that seemed to help and then michael eisner said well this looks fun for me im going to put a team in anaheim and bruce mcnall had the brains to say okay were going to let them in for a little bit of a discount so all of those things went together and then steve yzermans emergence in detroit what brett hull did in st louis and then what mike modano did in dallas and what mark messier was doing in new york so it was kind of a timing thing and i was just one piece of that and it all seemed to come together at the same time
1509210 well i dont know you never know definitely myself and the kings helped do that but im not sure who knows
1509211 you take minor hockey kids in california now or arizona they can compete against the top kids in canada we have people that love the game the games come a long long way in the southwest
1509212 you know what i remember the first week i was in la and i was going by these tennis courts and i stopped the car and said to a friend you know if we were in canada kids would be playing ball hockey or inline hockey here and it would be amazing and this guy said well this is california a year later there was a sign on the fence that said no inline hockey allowed and i was like weve come a long way you take minor hockey kids in california now or arizona they can compete against the top kids in canada 10 11 year old kids theyre very good you dont have as many but we are getting to that point we have some great young talent down there we have people that love the game the games come a long long way in the southwest
1509213 oh im ecstatic about it its one of my great thrills that kids want to play ice hockey in california and arizona and texas i think its very positive for our sport i tell parents all the time let your sons and daughters play inline hockey until theyre 8 9 10 and if they still enjoy the game its not going to hurt them when they jump into ice hockey so hockeys come a long way
1509214 i was hoping i knew i would make the best of everything but i was hoping it would be successful for la the first exhibition game i played there we drew 10 000 people and again i thought well what have i gotten myself into but by that second year when we were selling out every night it was pretty good
1509215 not until probably the very first playoff game at the end of that first year i still had a following and a feeling for them and im sure they did with me and until we played that first playoff game thats when you really realized you were the enemy
1509216 we were lucky to beat them we were down 3 games to 2 i dont think edmonton played a good game 6 we beat them 4 to 1 i believe and then came home for game 7 that we won but thats really neither here nor there because that probably jumped started that team to the next level and they went on to win a championship two years later
1509217 you know i let other people try to measure that i just know i played as hard as i could every night
1509218 its blatantly discriminatory to single out people with hiv its stupid and ridiculous

1509274 if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one
1509275 youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1509276 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1509277 this storm could bring in erratic winds and those conditions are the kind that can kill firefighters because in that wind the fires become explosive

1509290 we have offered this line in response to a growing number of requests for test equipment from people who simply do not need or cannot afford tools that generate or monitor hundreds or thousands of calls
1509291 people who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own
1509292 they were longing for a better country a heavenly world
1509293 abraham saw his day and rejoiced in the hope of it
1509294 all these people were still living by faith when they died they did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance and they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth
1509295 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness
1509296 the lord said to her two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you will be separated one people will be stronger than the other and the older will serve the younger
1509297 when isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see he called for esau his older son and said to him my son
1509298 when you come back from hunting then i will bless you
1509299 by faith abraham when god tested him offered isaac as a sacrifice he who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son
1509300 take your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the region of moriah sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains i will tell you about
1509301 god i know your voice i have walked with you worshiped you listened to you for years now how could you ask this
1509302 by faith abraham when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance obeyed and went even though he did not know where he was going
1509303 by faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country he lived in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise
1509304 by faith noah when warned about things not yet seen in holy fear built an ark to save his family
1509305 by faith noah when warned about things not yet seen in holy fear built an ark to save his family
1509306 by faith abraham even though he was past age and sarah herself was barren
1509307 with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible
1509308 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
1509309 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
1509310 the lord himself goes before you and will be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you do not be afraid do not be discouraged
1509311 was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise
1509312 the name van halen the family legacy is going to go on long after im gone
1509313 im not a spiteful person at this point in my life i dont need the drama i went through that when i was in my 20s and i dont feel like going through it again in my 50s
1509314 i think of my razor as a really high quality knife
1509315 its generally about as sharp as a knife can get
1509316 the choice was between a straight razor and a safety razor
1509317 how long did it take you to get the hang of it
1509318 it took about three weeks to stop cutting myself at least once every shave
1509319 strop your razor a dozen times first on the canvas side and then on the leather side i usually skip the canvas side unless my razor isnt honed enough shaving is best after a shower you want your face to be as wet as possible so dont use a towel soak your brush more on brushes below in hot water and then swirl it on your bar of soap for ten or so seconds now whip your brush in a bowl that contains a small amount of water whip for 30 to 90 seconds to create a lather apply lather to your face always shave first in a downward motion with the hair growth the chin and upper lip are the hardest parts after one pass downward you can re lather and shave perpendicular to the hair growth or shave against the hair growth two or three passes are generally required to get a close shave one with the grain one perpendicular and one against i generally only do two passes one with the grain one against after shaving splash warm water on your face to remove all of the soap residue then splash cold water on your face to close your pores then pat dry never wipe dry or youll dry out your skin too much you can then apply a facial lotion if you want
1509320 my bar of shaving soap which cost ninety nine cents at wal mart will probably last for dozens and dozens of shaves
1509321 i still shave about as much as i used to but if i go for several days and my facial hair gets long the razor has no problems cutting through it
1509322 but if i have an extra fifteen minutes its certainly more fun to use a straight razor
1509323 badger smells like wet dog for the first ten times
1509324 this has been constrained by nasas desire to complete the iss by 2010 but it has stated that its 500m investment in commercial orbital transportation services should remedy the situation

1509330 he drives out demons by the ruler of the demons
1509331 how can satan drive out satan if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand if a house is divided against itself that house cannot stand and if satan rebels against himself and is divided he cannot stand but is finished
1509332 on the other hand no one can enter a strong mans house and rob his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man
1509333 but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit never has forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin
1509334 how were you dressed when you crawled into your bag sir

1509337 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever v 2 let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy v 3 and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south v 4 they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in v 5 hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them v 6 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses v 7 and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation v 8 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men v 9 for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness v 10 such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron v 11 because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high v 12 therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to help v 13 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses v 14 he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunder v 15 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men v 16 for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder

1509469 i know what makes a good fight but i never thought i would be fighting him kelly has a lot of heart and determination but saying that ive never been afraid of a ghost
1509470 people talk and ask about why i am fighting bernard hopkins youve got a legend right here
1509471 hes a great fighter but on october 18 it will come to an end for bernard hopkins it is over for him
1509472 i believe im coming into this fight as the winner
1509473 people know me and boxing people know me and they know im a threat against anyone i am willing to say that i am coming into this fight to win
1509474 when we get into the ring it will just be me and him and that means it is 50 50
1509475 kelly comes in and throws the hammer down and its my job to take that away from him
1509476 this is a blue collar fight its like two guys working on a pier and get in a fight its two guys fighting with their hard hats on this is a blue collar sport the kind of fight that could happen in any inner city except now im from philly and hes from youngstown
1509477 this fight is about two guys one guy is coming forward and the other guys is looking to do his thing and that spells action
1509478 bernard hopkins has been through the wars and the fires he has never been cut and has never been beat up
1509479 i guess i would have to shoot him in the foot to get him to stop running from me
1509480 all i can tell you is that i will train as hard as i can to get in the best shape that i can be in for bernard hopkins
1509481 the supreme victory of faith over the apparent reality of things
1509482 the proving of things not seen the assurance of things hoped for
1509483 we have worked closely with hundreds of community members in various groups including roosevelt education association be a leader foundation and south mountain laveen chamber of commerce to ensure that the entire community is invested in improving our schools
1509484 we know this is just the beginning and there will always be room for improvement that said we are still very happy with the academic success our students have achieved so far we are on the right path
1509485 this improving track record and dedicated community outreach have yielded tremendous partnerships that have become nationally recognized
1509486 these partnerships include well known initiatives such as johns hopkins center for data driven reform in education the teach for america national summer training institute pearsons pilots for publishing reading tests and the asu best program

1509496 when the bomb happened there was a huge response from the public who came to leave flowers
1509497 i had been doing hand made paper workshops at flowerfield in portstewart at the time and had the idea of perhaps doing a workshop with the locals in the town with a view to maybe putting a piece of artwork in a doctors waiting room or a public space
1509498 i approached omagh district council and asked them about it after clintons visit i was approached by the council and asked to over see the project
1509499 after the touring exhibition i was approached by the then chief executive of the council john mckinney who asked me to write my story which was incorporated into a catalogue of photographs of the work called petals of hope
1509500 now larger versions of those photographs are going on display to mark the tenth anniversary of the bomb
1509501 on reflection as an artist petals of hope was an unbelievable experience when i look back at it not at all easy but unbelievable
1509502 it was an opportunity for us to do something creative out of such an atrocity
1509503 it gave us a clear identity of who we are and im not sure that we have had a chance to do that on a large scale and that is something now for creative people and for the mlas to take on
1509504 i had that opportunity and be involved in something that was community lead and community delivered and helped people
1509505 you will fall out of your chair cuz youll be laughin so hard
1509506 ive got some work to do mechanically first time i was facing hitters i was flying open with his delivery really bad
1509507 i can think of no national league city to follow what we did in yankee stadium other than st louis
1509508 the st louis cardinals one of our crown jewels are like sara lee we ask people what the great baseball cities are in america and they may mention various cities but everyone has st louis on their list as one of the great baseball cities in america

1509512 the 2007 results represent a phenomenal mix of books from a wide array of publishers throughout the united states as an executive in the publishing pr and marketing industry and president and ceo of jpx media i wanted to create an awards competition that recognized books in their publication year rather than months after the original launch window with a full publicity and marketing campaign promoting the results of bba this years winners and finalists will gain additional media coverage for the upcoming holiday retail season
1509513 bbas success begins with the enthusiastic participation of authors and publishers and continues with our distinguished panel of industry judges who bring to the table their extensive editorial pr marketing and design expertise
1509514 we liked the idea of having a title that described something that was bigger than ourselves moving us forward
1509515 we hope that is what this album represents to our fans
1509516 we are a melting pot of different styles that are glued together by our singers voice
1509517 sometimes we are heavy sometimes we are mellow and poppy i like the idea of being a band that writes whatever we want and has a singer that provides a continuity and consistency in the sound
1509518 its a producers job to take a song to a complete place and each producer had their own vision of what the songs could be
1509519 warren and david both know how great songs are made i like the fullness of bendeths mixes and the pop sensibility of warrens mixes i think we picked the right guy for each song
1509520 to have the opportunity to work with producers that are on that level is obviously amazing ive learned so much about music and songwriting by watching them
1509521 its been nice to see peoples enthusiasm for the record after working on it for so long
1509522 we were a little anxious because when you have that much time that you put into something you can start to doubt and overanalyze the tracks it definitely seems like people are falling in love with the whole record as opposed to just a few tracks
1509523 no the glass is fused into the frame of the window you cant get it out
1509524 i think that glass could be cut from the frame

1509527 no it isnt i even phoned the company 1 800 number and asked them what i could do with it
1509528 theres metal in that toy you could break it down and remove the metal
1509529 why are companies allowed to dump construction waste into the landfills

1509548 now you see him and he has good habits when you have that then fundamentally you get better his one on one routes will be better along with his awareness and knowing the defenses and adjustments and the complexities of what we do on offense

1509580 to really come together as one to show criminals were out watching we thought that was an important thing to do

1509582 its time to stand up and show them were not going to stand for it
1509583 that single contribution is most than the rewards we usually offer
1509584 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights to their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1509585 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement

1509624 within hours of our piece being published prostate cancer charities support groups and urologists around the country had circulated a
1509625 the uspstf recommends against screening for prostate cancer in men age 75 years or older
1509626 the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening in men younger than age 75 years
1509627 there just arent any good studies to show that men who get screened and treated for prostate cancer live longer than those who dont so the benefits are unknown but the harms of screening and treatment are real and well documented they include not just the costs and pain of treatment but also the incontinence and impotence that some men get after surgery the problem is that some prostate cancer grows quickly and is lethal some especially in older men is slow growing and never causes a problem that is why people say that more older men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer

1509651 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1509672 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
1509673 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop
1509674 what is hateful to yourself dont do to your fellow human being that is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary

1509700 if hes not traded by 4 p m today theres a 1 percent chance that he finishes the year with the red sox this has gotten so ugly
1509701 during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
1509702 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
1509703 i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
1509704 as midnight approached on wednesday night officials from the marlins and red sox said a deal involving manny ramirez was not done indications from pittsburgh were that the pirates were not satisfied with the players they were receiving in exchange for sending jason bay to boston and in california ramirezs agent scott boras said he had been told nothing which means nothing has been completed in terms of ramirez waving his no trade rights or in completing paperwork to send to the commissioners office so the complicated three way deal may go down close to thursdays 4 p m deadline
1509705 pawtucket ri the pawsox looked a little sloppy and a little lethargic on wednesday afternoon falling 8 3 to rochester after jumping out to a 2 0 lead in the first pawtucket managed just 1 run and 3 hits the rest of the way the normally sure handed pawsox also committed a pair of errors david pauley 12 4 took the loss as anthony swarzak won his triple a debut jeff natale hit his first i l home run for pawtucket the series resumes on thursday night at 7 05 p m michael bowden 0 2 faces carmen cali 5 0

1509719 the support of law enforcement has been key in the expansion of hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation and gender identity it is vitally important that the suspect is now formally charged with a hate crime as it shows the weld county district attorneys office and the greeley police department are strongly committed to enforcing this law
1509720 the bias crime designation sends a message to not only lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer lgbtq communities but also the greater communities that this type of violence is not acceptable

1509829 in may nestle reported that its bottled water profits had dropped acknowledging criticism of bottled water as a factor in decreased sales according to beverage marketing corporation last year the u s bottled water industry experienced its slowest annual revenue growth in more than 15 years
1509830 california will challenge the environmental plan for a bottled water plant in siskiyou county if the company does not revise its contract to pump water from the mccloud river
1509831 it takes massive quantities of oil to produce plastic water bottles and to ship them in diesel trucks across the united states
1509832 nestle will face swift legal challenge if it does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions of gallons of spring water from the mccloud river into billions of plastic water bottles
1509833 in the worst cases nestles water grab ruins streams ponds wells and aquifers and in all cases nestles practices raise serious questions about who should be allowed to control water our most essential resource and to what end will corporations like nestle or the communities that rely upon this most essential resource for their health livelihood and well being control water resources
1509834 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1509835 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1509836 dogs possess the capacity for a rudimentary form of empathy
1509837 other studies also demonstrated that dogs follow human pointing more likely to tell humans the location of hidden objects when they didnt see the object being hidden and tend to steal food when the humans are looking away or closing their eyes
1509838 as the dogs amazing skills to read human communication cues are thought to have been selected by human over last 15 000 years it is also possible that the same evolutionary process affected their skills to empathise with humans
1509839 another possibility is that contagious yawning and possibly empathy could be a more widespread characteristics among mammals
1509840 it is possible that such contagion coordinate the mood status between the dogs and humans
1509841 with a possible recession looming and a threat of further regulatory intervention the outlook for continuing defined benefit provision seems rather bleak
1509842 the credit crunch has blown apart bond yields and has flattered pension deficits to a remarkable extent
1509843 we now have very specific hiv drugs we can formulate as vaginal products
1509844 where hiv enters the body during sexual transmission is the vagina so you really want to have your highest concentration of drug there
1509845 we certainly have to be very cautious that the safety profile of the drugs is very high
1509846 we have to keep the context of the epidemic in mind right now women in the developing world are at very high risk for hiv infection and they have no other options for prevention
1509847 i dont think in the next five years were going to have a microbicide thats effective and ready for sale
1509848 theres no reason now to assume that its not going to work especially with the antiretroviral drugs

1509851 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1509852 there are many parts of a power station that you can build such as the boiler house and turbines that have nothing to do with ccs
1509853 this draft document should not be viewed as signalling anything about our intention to require carbon capture readiness if consent were to be granted to e on
1509854 they reveal an extra level of collusion between the government and britains biggest single carbon emitter the energy minister has been telling the public that a new plant could bury its emissions but privately its department is telling e on it wont have to
1509855 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1509856 once she recognises theres a problem she can do something about it the government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem
1509857 we need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help thats a long way down the road
1509858 i am not jose mourinho so why should people compare me with him
1509859 maybe if mourinho says he will win and then afterwards he doesnt that might cause problems because the manager is not playing its the players out on the pitch so if you say that and they make a mistake then you have to say its their fault
1509860 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise when people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cried for chelsea they loved chelsea its a big surprise people dont like us in england but chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan our history is not the same and you cant make history in two three or even 10 years but maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1509861 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1509862 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1509863 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1509864 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1509865 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1509866 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1509867 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1509868 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1509869 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1509870 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1509871 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1509872 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1509873 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1509874 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1509875 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1509876 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1509877 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1509878 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1509879 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1509880 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1509881 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men

1509938 it seemed as if this moment of observation went on and on and i realized seeing had become a variety of memory i was reminded of what i thought when staring for hours at a beautiful picture if you stare long enough your mind enters the time of the painting all time had now become this time
1509939 i liked to draw it was my wish and my world and i was in this happy position to be doing just that i didnt come out of a political background i didnt have to develop a language to destroy something in my head i just did it
1509940 i like to read about all that and see those works and there were lots of those influences in my work too so much has happened in the last century impressionism surrealism etc which we already call classic there was a wave in the 70s and 80s when there were really rude wild paintings in austria or middle europe the wave was of very organic or rhythmic painting and then in the late 1980s there was a reduction all over the continent and the art was getting very minimalistic then came video art and photo art and i think painting is now becoming important again but i think the new painting is a lot influenced by photographs video and other media
1509941 we have a different look now than even 10 years back its funny that when you watch something on the television from the 80s you immediately know that its from that period and the eighties are not that far gone
1509942 ten years ago a gallery just sent a paper invitation now its usually an email with file attachments and then there are the home pages the artists are also getting more global and more ethnic in asia there is also political art and religious influences
1509943 there is the international art market which has certain rules then there is if not an international but a smaller market in a town where there are maybe five painters they are well known in the country and they really earn a lot of money with that but they are not all that known internationally are they better painters i think you cant answer that there are a lot of artists who are very shy and they dont go out anywhere there are a lot of very skilled students at the academy and 80 per cent of them never get into the art market because they dont have the personality for it but they are intellectually sound there are not enough galleries to work with that
1509944 there are a lot of galleries but there are a lot more artists too and every year there are more people starting to study art
1509945 there was such hype about this man his work was good and he had good luck
1509946 there are a lot of artists that dont use any theory i think today in this century you cant work without some reflection of art history there are lots of artists who work with a gut feeling but i think it is important to combine the both

1509960 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word
1509961 i wanted to be a painter and my parents were planning to send me to paris to study art like all children i used to draw i was a painter right from the day i was born it is said that i was painting even in my mothers womb like a person who is madly in love with a woman and could do anything for her i was madly in love with painting but things got bad and my parents could not afford to send me anywhere
1509962 so i opted for mathematics and engineering and won the scholarship
1509963 i was teaching mathematics to graduate students of engineering at the aligarh university when i was 20 years old all my students were older than me without exception i would go in my slippers and talk to them we were good friends and they liked me we remained friends afterwards
1509964 art mein koi miltey hai shukar karo maar naheen daitay
1509965 i never had a problem there my training had all been in mathematics it doesnt sound very modest but i have been very good at whatever i attempted whether it was mathematics art or engineering in engineering i got a first class and came first in aligarh university i got an average of 86 6 percent and the person who came second with a 200 marks difference became a famous engineer who later joined the united nations
1509966 apparently the two painting and mathematics are very different but they are very much the same my field was mechanics
1509967 you are standing here 20 feet to that side and 10 feet down what is the effect of my standing here at that time
1509968 i was looking to do a phd from harvard but the government took me off to look at the design of warsak dam
1509969 i participated in the actual design of the dam and spent a year and a half with hg acres and company which was assigned the designing work of warsak
1509970 he said to me what your country needs at the moment is engineers and there are not that many people with the kind of background that you have
1509971 i worked on every aspect of designing and wrote a series of reports which was very useful information because all the engineers were there the report covered all the designs they did the assumptions they used and the kind of tests and investigations they had to do to arrive at the kind of assumptions
1509972 i was mostly painting doing portraits kabhee kisi ko khush karna hae having to please a person at times and i was very happy mazedar zamana tha those were enjoyable times engineering to karnee par rahee thee i had to do engineering of course i also had the chance to do what i liked doing
1509973 then the government sent me to afghanistan to do a portrait of king zahir shah they desperately wanted to make good relations with afghanistan i was asked to do a very flattering portrait of the king that would please him i told them that i would try to make a flattering portrait but when i do a portrait i have no control over it i react to the person so if you want to make sure it is a flattering portrait you have to go to some other painter who only makes flattering portraits luckily zahir shah was also an artist he used to paint he invited me to kabul and i stayed there for three years i made portraits of the king his granddaughter wali khan his uncle and of sir mahmood khan ghazi
1509974 was that the time when aslam khattak was the ambassador
1509975 i stayed at the kabul hotel and aslam khattak walked in and told his men to carry all my luggage and follow him what a lovely gesture
1509976 they are lovely people the land as well as the people are beautiful
1509977 idher kon see much hotee hain how many do you get to see here
1509978 bechare kee kismet kharab hae poor thing he is ill fated
1509979 i was doing a portrait of karim aga khan and was traveling with him to karachi lahore peshawar chitagong and then to paris
1509980 ayub khan was a very charming and affectionate person bhutto was a good friend of mine he once wanted his portrait done wearing the mao cap he was very impulsive but very brilliant bhutto in every kind of relationship wanted to establish the fact that he was superior of course he was superior in lots of ways but not in everything and even that little thing would trouble him basically he was a nice person
1509981 she has a father who is very famous that makes it difficult
1509982 thats the traditional mosaic but i have taken it further i was very fond of him bhutto
1509983 the first time he was annoyed with me a photograph was published in time magazine showing bhutto standing before the quaids mausoleum making a fist bhutto asked me to make a painting of it but for me to paint that was very awkward i was not going to base my painting on some photograph so i didnt make it a long long time after that gulgee met bhutto i didnt want to meet him but had to you know bhutto to chorhta naheen tha never let go
1509984 at least bhutto respected me because he knew how far he could go he called me when he came into power and we talked he was annoyed and said you know what i could have done for you he was a bit annoyed because yahya khan gave me the pride of performance before that he was annoyed with me keh mein khatir karta tha ayub khan se because i used to be hospitable to ayub khan when ayub khan was out of power i said bhutto saab he ayub khan treated me kindly so i have a loyalty to him in fact when he resigned and came by train rafi munir i and were the only two people who met him at the station but i cried when he was hanged
1509985 i remember in the days of bhutto you made a sculpture out of a plane that had crashed and it was put on a roundabout wo mujhe yaad hae
1509986 you know what happened i was at a party and jatoi sahab said bare sahab kehte haen ke ye bohot uncha lagaya hae isko neeche karo the big boss says that this is placed too high up lower it down soche bagher hee maine keh diya key i just said without thinking it is concreted now allah mian ka naam hae it is gods name and to me allah mian is not on the pedestal but up high saeed ahmed shipping wala was standing there he said you are very brave you kicked off the old man but i never had any intention of taking on anybody mainne socha hee naheen unhon ne kaha neeche karo i really didnt think he told me to lower it i said is tarah achcha lagta hae it is looking nice the way it is then he had it removed he heard about it then everyone got together and said how bad it was not worth dirt and filth
1509987 rajiv gandhi was a very charming polite and sensitive person bohot khiyal rakhne wala a very hospitable person i traveled with him during his election campaign in 1986
1509988 rajiv enquired how he would travel by car he was told and he arranged a plane for me to travel
1509989 i met him shaukat aziz while i was doing some work for the citi bank he had just joined the bank and i told him that he was going to be a very important person one day at that time he was just a young intern the bank had assigned him to look after me
1509990 musharraf is a very lovable person i know nothing about politics but hes nice you cant point your finger to something that this thing is nice you just get a nice feeling when you are with somebody
1509991 and there was a complete blackout of news about the work
1509992 he was very nice as far as i was concerned
1509993 in the beginning pakistans image was made by the artists like zainul abedin and sadequain zainul abedin had great talent he had no conceit and was a simple humble person while sadequain was an excellent painter his handicap was his conceit
1509994 hafeez shaikh is one of my best friends he is also a very charming person
1509995 i paint the whole day from 11 am till around 8 pm my brush moves like a quill my earlier calligraphy was classical in calligraphy you have to go back to your roots i can write in any of the styles of the old masters but i have given it a new direction in islam soch mein to agae gae we progressed in thought
1509996 people think that an artist should be natakee performer they like that kind of thing people are more impressed with their personality their image many artists are like that and tend to do nothing there should be genuine involvement in the work
1509997 they were not all great painters the desperate need of the people for heroes in art made them into painters of substance whether there was any depth or not talent was there but they can make their little talent go a long way in making it a big happening
1509998 art critic eric gibson came to my exhibition in washington in 1993 he came only because it was in a museum he said mr gulgee you dont need to come with me i like to see the paintings on my own matlab dafaa ho jayo teri zaroorat naheen hae meaning get lost you are not needed i said i would like to ask you one favour spend a little time with at least one of my paintings he came running back and said gulgee what have you done our artists have been doing the same work but you have got something in your work which they dont get then i took him along and said in these works you need a connection beyond call it nature god us ke bagher naheen hota
1509999 mr gulgee began as a portraitist moving into his colour abstractions only in the past 20 years these paintings are by far his most interesting in them the artist is attempting to fuse two traditions islamic calligraphy in which writing both carries a religious text and decorates a page and the western style of abstract expressionism with its movemented brushstrokes these paintings combine the two traditions with grace and elegance and at the same time manage to transcend them the paintings stand as more than the sum of their sources
