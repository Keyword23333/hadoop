3480000 she looks exhausted and drawn it gives her a hungover look even if she hasnt been drinking unfortunately it has a greater effect because shes 39 and not 25
3480001 agencies must apply the same level of objectivity and administrative probity in using these provisions as they do in making any personnel related decisions
3480002 a reseller can potentially have hundreds if not thousands of various manufacturers products and services under their gsa schedule contract
3480003 punitive action against a reseller for the aggressive marketing tactics of a manufacturer under their schedule is not a recourse that serves the governments best interest nor is it fair to the reseller
3480004 the night is almost gone the day of salvation will soon be here
3480005 its always good to go against somebody new they have a different style running attack than we do and a lot of similarities in the passing game there is a little different philosophy but it will be good work for our defense and our offense
3480006 we dont tackle obviously but well form up a little bit we have a pretty smart football team on both sides and a lot of competition at the same time they are trying to protect each other its more of an evaluation process and cooler heads always prevail we were able to do that last time and im sure well be able to do it this time
3480007 basically it is the same both sessions well do different teamwork on one session than the other one is more play action the other one is more drop action the morning practice will be a little longer than the afternoon practice
3480008 its a little different you are still going to hit you hit your own players you hit somebody else its good especially in the third week to hit somebody else you get used to the talent level here first teamers second teamers third teamers what their strength is what their weakness is its always nice to go against somebody you dont know you play a lot more honest because you dont know the tendencies it is a good evaluation process for all of us
3480009 that is why you do it there is a respect level when you go against another team and you want to go out there and practice well and play well when you have different competition it always gets the juices flowing thats one of the reasons why we do it
3480010 our football team is pretty smart i told you our last time we practiced against them i thought it was a super bowl team and people laughed i dont think people are laughing anymore because of the talent they displayed last season we are going against a very talented team a lot of pro bowl players out there it will be a good test for us
3480011 its going to be nice we will get to go against different defenses techniques and players its going to be fun to kind of judge yourself early in the preseason to see where you are at for a couple of days
3480012 its no doubt about it its a little bit different going against your own guys it definitely brings up the intensity level
3480013 i will never ascribe to the national mania for confusing icons with heroes nothing any athlete ever does during competition is particularly heroic and the only baseball hero i can think of is jackie robinson after 9 11 i read about two office workers who risked their own lives taking turns to carry a fellow worker a paraplegic down over 70 flights of stairs you probably dont know the names of those two and i know you dont own any cards or posters bearing their names but each is 20 more times a hero than any player who ever took the field
3480014 take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes
3480015 ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am the lord
3480016 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
3480017 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them
3480018 you are the sons of the lord your god you shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead
3480019 then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments 3 and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went 4 and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
3480020 and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron
3480021 in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon 19 the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers 20 the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings 21 the rings and nose jewels 22 the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins 23 the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the veils
3480022 honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
3480023 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord
3480024 the women of zion are haughty walking along with out stretched necks flirting with their eyes tripping along with mincing steps with ornaments jingling on their ankles 17 therefore the lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of zion the lord will make their scalps bald
3480025 what is the difference between traditional art and media art
3480026 in the darkest hole youd be well advised not to plan my funeral before the body dies

3480028 no more time just one more time suck me through a barbed screen
3480029 we have a serious need for safety and expansion of our infrastructure
3480030 in the end this all comes down to whos going to pay for it
3480031 you get people to do things in their own home states to conserve energy
3480032 we are not a few miles down a long road we are a few inches down the long road all the rest is literature
3480033 every time we go into a room with other people its as if we have a teleprompter in front of us and its telling us the history of ourselves versus these people we cant even think of thinking without this huge library of good information and bad information
3480034 its as if you threw a rock in the air and in midflight you gave that rock consciousness that rock would come up with 12 airtight logical esons why its going in that direction
3480035 justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done
3480036 would it not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another one

3480038 the forth term cambodian government will be increased to have more than 400 members
3480039 in each ministry there are at least six secretaries of state and six under secretaries of state
3480040 the increased number of members in the new government is a big burden for the national budget of a developing country while the citizens livelihood is facing difficulties
3480041 related to this increase civil society organizations continue to criticize it to be a government with a head bigger than the body and expressed concern regarding work efficiency and the related expenses to come from national resources
3480042 the increase of the numbers of members of the government has been explained by officials of the government to aim at retaining political stability and national security and that this increase is not made without clear advance considerations
3480043 in the compositions of the new government there are open positions for officials from other parties as partners
3480044 though there is criticism from different organizations there is no solution against the inflation of the number of members of the new government
3480045 as for the compositions of the council of ministers the cabinet it is assumed that there the power will be distributed according to the institutions and the factions of high ranking officials of the party some are from the line of the president of the cambodian peoples party mr chea sim and some are from the line of prime minister hun sen senior ministers from mr chea sims line are not as powerful as those from prime minister hun sens line officials who came over from the sam rainsy party will be given positions so that they will not leave again these assignments of officials who had joined only recently are making the majority of long time activists of the cambodian peoples party dissatisfied
3480046 what the blazing hell do you mean it wont come off

3480055 the fans form part of this club and their help is very important
3480056 if we fight at every moment they understand what we are doing and they will know that there will be high points and low points during the game the most important thing is to give our all
3480057 the objective of pre season was to enable us to hit the ground running
3480058 weve been preparing well and getting to know our opponents but the most important thing is how we perform
3480059 i wouldnt like my players to lose to a team because of their prestige of course we could lose because we are talking about football we are meeting a team that makes mistakes too they have a lot of pressure much more than us im sure theyll have moments of hesitation and if we profit can from them
3480060 we knew that we wanted the game to change over time because we look at a lot of statistics and we play a lot of tf2 and we learned from counter strike over the years that its fun to have the game evolve over time especially based on engagement with your customers we look at how people are playing and we try to have our customers get more value both in new content and in changes to the game rules the idea came about with those two things in mind we had a tool and achievements and a goal
3480061 we look at our relationship with our customers as a very long term thing not a product by product thing continuing to give them content and continuing to give them a reason to tell their friends to buy the product is something we try to drive its very profitable its something were happy to keep doing its very fun work to do as opposed to a three year death march on a big huge product

3480076 we have sufficient stocks of fuel and fuel imports are continuing we have no rail cars filled fuel which have not reached armenia
3480077 everything is normal georgian roads are not dangerous and the railway leading to armenia is absolutely safe
3480078 cargo shipments by rail are being carried out as planned
3480079 the railway did not stop for a single minute it has continued to operate carrying both people and cargos
3480080 as a result of the bomb raids there have arisen difficulties in the work of the port of poti which have reflected negatively on cargo shipments
3480081 there were disruptions in our supplies for the past four or five days as no cargos were transported from georgia
3480082 we received ten rail cars of petrol overnight while other companies imported large quantities of diesel fuel but still we have a fairly large volume of fuel stocked in the batumi terminal

3480084 for his part s ohanian assured the ambassador that armenias territory will not be used as a military launch pad for hostilities against georgia expressing hope that ways will be found to normalize the situation in georgia
3480085 we had a plan for fuel mileage and we thought it was going to work
3480086 it was working until the late cautions helped everybody else our car was pretty good but luck just didnt go our way today heck we didnt get any luck all weekend we have our work cut out for us for the next four races but i know this team can make it happen
3480087 it doesnt matter where you are in the points until after richmond really
3480088 we didnt really run that great at watkins glen we had a real average car and we had a real above average strategy and pit crew so those guys got me the good finish really
3480089 the hardest part is having people dive bombing you into the corners
3480090 if you battle hard with them you take a chance on losing a lot of points i had that in the back of my mind all day
3480091 we were just a little off today but this joe gibbs racing crew worked hard and we brought home a top 10 finish i really couldnt push the car more than i was or i would have wrecked it and that would have been a worst case scenario
3480092 we know what we have to work on and were ready to go to work to get back to our best and get into this chase
3480093 but just as important it just continues to show how strong our team is

3480102 in fact i normally tell people that anyone can drive michigan it is so wide that cars can race three and four wide there every lap it is one of my favorite race tracks because it is so fun to drive we didnt have a good race at michigan in june so we really want to improve on our performance
3480103 it is typically a good track for us so im looking forward to rebounding from the last race and having a good run
3480104 we have been working diligently on our seven post rig track testing and improving our cars in the shop
3480105 michigan is a great track and it promotes great racing because of the long sweeping corners the key to michigan is handling and being able to go into turn 3 without being loose then come off turn 4 strong for the frontstretch add comment

3480118 se resolvieron las redes internas de chacra xiii de agua y cloacas
3480119 nos faltan los nexos de uni n que no nos han permitido evacuar los l quidos cloacales debido a que el municipio objet estas obras nosotros no las pudimos realizar y tuvimos que realizar la contrataci n de estas nuevas plantas para poder salir del paso y luego realizar el tendido de estos grandes conductos
3480120 a mi ver lo que corresponde al municipio es poder realizar todo el tendido de las redes cloacales el municipio tiene que hacer las obras de nexo y apoyamos el ofrecimiento del municipio
3480121 nosotros como instituto tenemos la financiaci n y los fondos disponibles desde naci n para realizar la obra de nexo que ten amos para evacuar los l quidos cloacales desde la chacra xiii a la planta vieja esa obra el municipio no nos permiti hacerla y nosotros vamos a aportar esos fondos para poder sacar los l quidos

3480134 since september 11 cctv cameras magnetometers biowatch air sniffers razor wire concrete fortifications and all the rest of the machinery of state security and surveillance have become so much a part of the furniture of life in the us that we barely notice them
3480135 since its birth but most explicitly since the 1950s the cinema has played with surveillance voyeurism and the power of the gaze
3480136 surveillance themes are pervasive in popular culture although we often do not think of them as such
3480137 from 2006 britain will be the first country where every journey by every car will be monitored
3480138 the scp players are frank truth sayers who gently and humorously remind us that the rampant growth of public surveillance is something we should be uneasy with and feel nauseated about

3480155 shes just not as vocal a womens advocate as i want to see
3480156 both partners may be just sick to death of sickness and thats the first thing my husband said when i mentioned john edwards confession he said maybe edwards had an affair because he just wanted things to be normal again maybe he was tired of cancer and treatment
3480157 my first thought was that maybe one or both of them just couldnt see a way to reconnect erotically after breast cancer
3480158 maybe having an affair when your spouse has just faced down mortality is a way of affirming your own survival maybe its a form of denial about your partners mortality and your own this might be just an extension of the stereotypical mid life crisis but cranked up to eleven
3480159 and maybe with the pressures of raising two young kids and running for president the edwards just hadnt yet figured out how to be a couple together again my husband and i struggled enough and we only had two little kids and a couple of university jobs
3480160 in the end why john edwards strayed will remain a mystery to everyone outside his family and thats only right they deserve their privacy elizabeth has asked for privacy as they work through this a marriage should remain a mystery to everyone outside it
3480161 i find it ironic in the extreme that dave wilson should be talking about respect and fairness when he shows absolutely no respect towards a very important party the public

3480181 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3480182 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3480183 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3480184 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3480185 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3480186 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3480187 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3480188 theyve also learned how to better utilize the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3480189 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets
3480190 a cyberwarfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian web sites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs

3480225 i was ahead of schedule all year long i was going into world cup events with the goal of just making the finals and not only made the finals but won a world cup bronze here in april and a silver in germany last month
3480226 i was really on top of my game havent felt this good in 10 or 15 years
3480227 its very disappointing because im shooting as good as ive ever shot
3480228 im ranked third in the world and i was a serious medal contender to go out there and just lose it in one day thats the olympics you wait four years and hope its your day unfortunately it wasnt i ran into some problems with my game and just didnt have time to fix them
3480229 in conjunction with usa shooting im trying to develop some more junior camps
3480230 weve got to fill the gap weve got to bring somebody up to replace us old guys
3480231 i seriously made up my mind that this was it
3480232 but the new coach you could see inside that he was ok with me shooting badly here so i asked him what he was so happy about and he said you cant quit like this youre going to be back and i said no im not and he said oh yeah you are
3480233 hes the same guy who cpred me and brought me back to life

3480243 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3480244 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3480245 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3480246 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3480247 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
3480248 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
3480249 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
3480250 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
3480251 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
3480252 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
3480253 linking this approach with some type of comprehensive watershed management system may be a new paradigm in which policymakers can address nonpoint source pollution from agriculture
3480254 people make a cost benefit calculation when considering whether to have an extramarital affair this calculation has a connection with biological and socioeconomic factors and men and women calculate the net benefits from having an affair differently
3480255 so what did you do last night the economics of infidelity
3480256 the benefits of female infidelity reduce after the age of 40 because a woman would no longer benefit in terms of improved gene quality from the affair men also experience a reduction of sperm quality around the age of 45 but the reproductive benefits of an affair expend further into a mans lifetime than a womans
3480257 if a couple divorces because of an extramarital affair a woman married to a highly educated man will lose income and may not be able to find another partner of similar quality men act as if this consideration is not important
3480258 the result that religion does not affect male behavior toward infidelity is consistent with expectations based on biology as with spousal education men dont weigh the costs spousal quality or eternal damnation when deciding whether or not to have an affair
3480259 were concerned for the safety of thousands of children who have had to leave their homes and villages with their families
3480260 it is likely that some children will have been separated from their parents in the confusion and if so these children will be particularly vulnerable and in need of support

3480373 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3480374 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3480375 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3480376 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3480377 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3480378 we have four children and when we go on vacation they always go with us we hear it all the time from parents oh we cant wait to get on our plane to aruba and get away from the kids
3480379 i am an old timer these are the kinds of parents who will think nothing of purchasing a pool hummer 300 leather jacket camper boat cell phone and cable tv but when it comes down to day care they will always seek to find the best deal
3480380 what parents today dont realize is that there is a price to pay for these big ticket items the price is working lots of overtime and away from family time and kid time take your kids or dont go on vacation
3480381 the idea of parents needing to get away from their children once in a while reflects a deep rooted attitude that is the basis for a number of marital problems
3480382 what a terrible feeling to think someone especially your parents needs their space from you husbands wives and parents want to continue with all their needs and wants regardless of who it hurts if parents spent more time with their kids instead of running off on their getaways maybe they would be aware of their childrens needs and problems
3480383 my daughter has a 3 year old son and a special needs 10 month old daughter my son has an infant daughter and we welcome the opportunity to care for her too
3480384 grandma has helped care for her grandson while his parents have taken his sister for several medical procedures now they are planning a trip alone and grandma is happy for them
3480385 when we are caring for our grandson the emphasis is on him and his well being we let him know he is loved and that he is safe and secure their parents will return renewed and happy to see their children
3480386 my 5 year old daughter was anxious about going to her first camp this summer she did fine but cried some the first day now she is nervous about starting kindergarten what about tips for reducing school anxiety
3480387 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3480388 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence
3480389 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3480390 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3480391 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3480392 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3480393 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3480394 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to military operations proves to be a step towards de escalation
3480395 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus
3480396 in the context of falling non opec crude oil output from other parts of the world this extra oil is vital
3480397 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk
3480398 itll be mostly demo and lecture to start with hands on coming later

3480412 i am extremely concerned that this theft of information could cause anxiety to our customers particularly our pensioners
3480413 i am also very concerned that we were not made aware of the nature and extent of the loss at the time of the theft
3480414 until now i had a healthy case of denial going on

3480416 its been so easy for people to get into debt now the economic climate has changed and panic is setting in

3480418 ive no idea what im spending this on although its more than likely coffee thats e3 25 every morning by 20 working mornings a month which comes to 65 how have i been spending 65 a month on coffee
3480419 shes in a good place in that things havent gotten totally out of control
3480420 the first thing she needs to do is sit down and work out an accurate budget of her non discretionary payments that means no luxuries theres no allowance in her budget for car tax car service medical bills that sort of thing she needs to put all of those things in there
3480421 as for the credit card i suggest she changes supplier and moves to someone who will give her interest free credit
3480422 if she gets made redundant her first port of call must be to her mortgage supplier
3480423 i thought id have more money as i got older but now im going to have less

3480495 researchers will assess the patients anxiety levels quality of life and pain levels
3480496 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance
3480497 then it would allow terminal patients hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
3480498 psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences that at 14 month follow up were considered by volunteers to be among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives
3480499 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3480500 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3480501 there are similarities between the typical traits of creative people and the subjective psychological characteristics of the psychedelic hallucinogenic drug experience this phenomenon was studied in a number of small trials and case studies in the 1960s results were inconclusive and the quality of these studies by modern research standards was merely anecdotal nevertheless with todays current renaissance in psychedelic drug research and the growing interest in cognitive enhancing drugs now may be the time to re visit these studies with contemporary research methods

3480510 heavy speculation of localised food shortages have resulted in heavy competition for maize purchases and an increase in maize prices compared to what is normally expected at this time of the season
3480511 our national requirement is 2 4 metric tonnes mt and that gives us a surplus of 400 000 metric tonnes this year
3480512 we are suffering because of a liberalised economy but we wont sit back and watch traders dictating prices to us we are working on drastic measures that will make maize a protected produce and a property of the malawi government
3480513 if admarc and nfra are able to get the maize locally it means that the grain is available in most households
3480514 its obvious that we wont be selling at old prices because prices keep changing
3480515 traders are focusing on purchasing maize now for sale after the main harvest period when household stocks of own produced food deplete
3480516 its true that as traders we have contributed to the rise in maize prices some areas in the country do not have maize yes but we are not in a crisis yet to justify the high grain prices

3480546 i started out more painterly now its more sculptural im trying to be clean if you want to hang it in your house you dont want it to fall off the wall art professors will tell you thats not important but it is
3480547 as a product of americas plastic throwaway culture it seems prophetic that im best at making art from stuff that people dont want stuff they no longer need but dont quite throw away as the world becomes more polluted with this type of refuse i see this process as a type of alchemist pursuit this transformative activity can also be seen as a metaphor to how we as humans interact with the earth the residue of this process is sometimes called art
3480548 its kind of a sickness because once you start with garbage you really dont want to throw it away

3480554 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3480555 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3480556 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3480557 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3480558 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong

3480566 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3480567 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3480568 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

3480570 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3480571 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3480572 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3480573 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3480574 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3480575 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3480576 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3480577 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3480578 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3480579 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3480580 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3480581 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3480582 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3480583 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3480584 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3480585 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3480586 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3480587 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3480588 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3480589 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3480590 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3480591 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3480592 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3480593 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3480594 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3480595 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3480596 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3480597 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3480598 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3480599 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3480600 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3480601 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3480602 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3480603 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3480612 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3480613 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3480615 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3480616 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3480617 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3480618 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3480619 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3480622 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3480623 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3480624 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3480625 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3480626 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3480627 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3480628 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3480629 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

3480631 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3480632 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3480642 dan bagi orang orang yang apabila mereka diperlakukan dengan dzolim mereka membela diri dan balasan suatu kejahatan adalah kejahatan yang serupa maka barangsiapa memaafkan dan berbuat baik maka pahalanya atas tanggungan alloh sesungguhnya dia tidak menytukai orang orang yang dzolim dan sesungguhnya orang orang yang membla diri sesudah teraniaya tidak ada dosa apapun atas mereka sesungguhnya dosa itu atas orang orang yang berbuiat dzolim kepada manusia dan melampaui batas di muka bumi tanpa hak mereka itu mendapat adzab yang pedih tetapi orang yang bersabar dan memaafkan sesungguhnya perbuatan yang demikian itu termasuk hal hal yang di utamakan
3480643 jika diberikan kepada orang orang menurut tuntutan mereka kalau tiap gugatan diterima begitu saja pasti ada orang orang yang menuntut harta benda sesuatu kaum serta darah mereka akan tetapi haruslah ada keterangan bukti bukti dan saksi bagi yang menuntut dan sumpah bagi yang mengingkari
3480644 haruslah ada keterangan bukti bukti dan saksi bagi yang menuntut dan sumpah bagi yang mengingkari
3480645 hai orang orang yang beriman jika datang kepadamu orang fasik membawa suatu berita maka periksalah dengan teliti agar kamu tidak menimpakan suatru musibah kepada suatu kaum tanpa mengetahui keadaannya yang menyebabkan kamu menyesal atas perbuatanmu itu
3480646 telitilah dan berhati hatilah dalam menetapkan sesuatu agar kalian tidak menyesal atas perbuatan kalian dan ketahuilah bahwa kedzoliman adalah kegelapan pada hari kiamat janganlah kalian diperturutkan oleh hawa nafsu dan ketamakan kalian untuk memerangi islam dan pemeluknya
3480647 menganggap halal suatu perbuatan haram yang telah jelas keharamannya maka pelakunya telah kafir berdasarkan kesepakatan umat
3480648 takutlah kalian kepada alloh terhadap perlakuan kalian terhadap mujahidin janganlah kalian menjadi penolong bagi orang orang yahudi

3480653 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3480654 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3480655 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3480656 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3480657 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3480658 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3480659 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3480660 who are open to doing something on the production side
3480661 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3480662 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3480663 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3480664 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3480665 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3480666 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3480667 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3480668 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3480669 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3480670 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3480671 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3480672 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3480673 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3480674 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3480675 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3480676 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3480677 his work ethic is one thing that the usc coaches dont have to worry about the 6 2 280 pound true sophomore from sacramento received the john mckay award in 2007 which is given to the underclassman with the most competitive spirit

3480683 google launching with psychonauts as a trial platform is like a new cable network launching with a coen brothers movie
3480684 i see a lot of benefit and danger in religion like anything i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3480685 and most of the atheists were very tolerant as well
3480686 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3480687 less as a product and more as a franchise or brand
3480688 whereas the sims we kept expanding vertically we kept selling expansion packs to the same customers over and over i think spore we want to say what other kinds of experiences activities formats media can we bring spore out and at that point you have to say what does the brand mean
3480689 and thats where weve been thinking about spore as this brand thats the intersection of creativity and science
3480690 science is an inherently interesting thing a lot of the time its not presented that interestingly if you look at documentaries on cable television if youre into that science its kind of fun to watch and theres some pretty good science shows for kids but arent that many fast paced really intelligent very visual things for adults that feel like entertainment thats the kind of direction i want spore microtransactions still on the menu
3480691 that is why we explicitly reject hayeks view that society has no obligation to others who are unknown to us and hayeks preparedness to allow fundamental social instutions like the family to fend entirely for themselves against unrestrained market forces

3480718 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3480719 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3480720 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3480721 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3480830 farming is an industry and has to be treated as an industry
3480831 dont repeat our mistakes because you have a lot to clean up afterwards
3480832 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3480833 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3480834 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3480835 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3480836 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future
3480837 they just said a boy was shot in the head
3480838 i came outside and there were ambulances and cops galore

3480843 as valenzuela is being led away to a police car a third officer jason zangara can be seen repeatedly punching the cuffed suspect in the face he then falls to the ground
3480844 ultimately this will allow us to create better biofuel crops
3480845 right now about half of the biofuel crops dont have genomic databases and the ones that do are in many different places and are annotated differently which makes it difficult to compare and use the information
3480846 our biofuel genomic database portal will include information on any crop that can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol including all the grasses such as corn rice maize wheat and other biofuel species such as poplar willow and pine
3480847 this will save researchers a lot of effort so we expect it to be a valuable resource for scientists at msu and around the world
3480848 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
3480849 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges
3480850 and these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
3480851 i let a big third down play go early on i dropped one
3480852 after that i went to the sideline and told him it was my fault and i told him it wont happen again he knows that he trusts me and as you see he kept throwing the ball to me
3480853 after i came out a lot of guys were really positive about how i played which feels good
3480854 it feels good to know that i have the support of not only the management which i think has been proven in the public eye but the guys as well which is very important to me
3480855 the interception we couldve caught the ball a couple of dropped passes overall he played great he led the offense and thats all we can ask for
3480856 he was probably more excited than anyone else to get in front of the home crowd and just show em what he can do
3480857 i told him youre a better man than most people because most people wouldnt be able to handle the situation the way he handled it he handled it just like a grown man and said the right things it seems to have worked out for him
3480858 when i was unveiled i said i was not counting on him but i also said we would treat him as any other player
3480859 during the past two three weeks the past month that we have been together i have been very pleased with his performance i only have words of praise
3480860 we were about 75 percent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3480861 the addition of therapy staff is an important step in the realization of our strategic growth plan and we are extremely pleased to have made our second acquisition in the allied health sector working together with mr diamond and mr glomski we believe that orion
3480862 we are excited about our partnership with orion because of their culture of commitment to their employees
3480863 this acquisition is a meaningful step forward in executing our strategy of building a leading national player in the value added healthcare staffing space the combination of the therapy staff business model the talent of their existing management team and orion
3480864 this is an important step in the process and we are excited that this brings us closer to being able to move forward with bringing the benefits of advanced metering to customers in the oncor service area we look forward to now having the commissioners hear and rule on our proposal
3480865 reports of declining u s competitiveness in mathematics and science at the post secondary level have prompted measures in statehouses across the country to raise standards and achievement in science and math at the high school level
3480866 in many cases this is reinforced by new high school graduation testing requirements
3480867 the higher performance standards in georgia present an exceptional opportunity for our company
3480868 in addition to having one of the few legitimately research based math curricula we are committed to partnering with administrators and teachers to ensure that they receive the support and professional development to be successful for the long term

3480877 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3480878 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3480879 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3480880 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3480881 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3480882 this is telecommunications modernization at the network layer at present many unisys customers around the world are utilizing intelligent network in applications over legacy technology
3480883 now with the expanded capabilities of the unisys asc solution those customers can migrate their in applications to ims and ngn networks at a much lower cost
3480884 our customers value a transitional strategy based on modernizing the network layer
3480885 traditionally applications are not easily extended to new networks without costly custom integration this often results in profitable applications being retired or replicated when ngn service networks are introduced the unisys asc extends the life and investment of these legacy applications while enabling the creation of new service bundles at a faster time to market

3480890 it was a good day for amazon com with shares rising more than 8 after a report by citigroup analyst mark mahaney doubling his previous predicted sales for the e book reader
3480891 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3480892 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3480893 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3481008 had everett worked for ec comics in the 1950s and not marvel comics he would be recognized as the top horror artist of the decade and this new book will prove that assertion
3481009 my brothers and i are grateful and delighted that our fathers talent is being celebrated in this new work by blake bell bill everetts life work centered in the golden age of comics is a treasure that were pleased can be shared with the rest of the art world
3481010 everett is highly respected among the cognoscenti but little known outside those circles everett was a stylistic virtuoso with a rich textured tactile inking technique and we hope that blakes fire and water will do for everett what his book on ditko did for that artist give the artist his critical due while spreading an appreciation to a larger audience

3481014 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that
3481015 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3481016 drilling is pointless because the united states has only 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves
3481017 this is a misleading because it refers only to known oil reserves according to the interior departments minerals management service mms while there are an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil in the off limits portions of the ocs those estimates were made using old data from now outdated seismic equipment in short there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known
3481018 the oil companies arent using the leases they already have
3481019 drilled several wells to explore the area at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and started constructing the necessary infrastructure to bring the oil to market
3481020 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3481021 according to the mms between 1993 and 2007 there were 651 spills of all sizes at ocs facilities in federal waters three miles or more offshore that released 47 800 barrels of oil with 7 5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156 900 barrels produced
3481022 besides if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important its hard to explain why the united states should rule out drilling off its own coasts
3481023 a sanford c bernstein amp co report says theres a lot of offshore oil that could be produced very quickly california could actually start producing new oil within a year the bernstein report said because the oil is in shallow water and drilling platforms have been there since before the moratoria
3481024 true leadership would emphasize both alternative sources and rational approaches to developing oil and natural gas

3481029 this update contains several improvements to enhance stability and performance
3481030 its a very emotional thing to have a person walk again when theyve been paralyzed
3481031 its very rare to make a full recovery because the spinal cord is a very sensitive part of our body and any injury to it is basically permanent i think hes a very lucky man
3481032 the last game of touch footy i played i fell over five times i thought i was getting uncoordinated but bigger things were happening
3481033 i just thought it was a bad back a pinched nerve
3481034 some may arise from birth sometimes after surgery or a minor injury they can develop but were really not sure why they come about
3481035 if chambliss had done a better job standing up for georgia families he wouldnt be in this position
3481036 instead hes become a washington politician supporting the economic policies that have gotten us into the mess were in now
3481037 jim martin is in a strong position because hes offering a real alternative taking away tax breaks for oil companies standing up to special interests controlling spending in washington and fighting to make the economy work for the middle class again
3481038 georgians are not happy with where saxby chambliss has taken their state and their country and theyre eager for change
3481039 with the general election only beginning a week ago jim martin is in position to mount a strong challenge
3481040 price could start to rise again in october or november as people begin to realize that the harvest is coming up short
3481041 i am not surprised that u s farmers surpassed the projections made last month u s farmers are undoubtedly undisputedly the very best at what they do and are very familiar with this volatile business despite the devastation they endured they rose to the task of generating a reliable supply of grains
3481042 the extreme wetness that we had this year creates trauma for the plant we could see stunted grown and less productive plants
3481043 the robust harvest predicted by usda hinges on no early frost harming the significant portions of the corn crop that are developing late because of the midwest floods
3481044 second it indicates that ethanol demand is increasing by 36 from 2007
3481045 given that ethanol is continuing to divert an ever larger share of our corn supply away from feed and food even a harvest like the one predicted by usda may not be enough to prevent continued food inflation and to avoid additional harm to family farmers who raise meat and poultry
3481046 accusing it of trammeling religious freedom by declaring the church a historic landmark and refusing to allow church leaders to tear it down
3481047 we believe this brutalist unwelcoming bunkerlike building is not a proper representation of our practice or our theology and that without a compelling government interest our members not the historic preservation review board are in the best position to determine that representation
3481048 in het rapport wordt gewaarschuwd dat europa het terrorisme niet zal verslaan indien er niet met washington wordt samengewerkt
3481049 alle 27 lidstaten van de eu moeten hun informatie op het gebied van terrorismebestrijding combineren videosurveillance diensten en onbemande vliegtuigen in gebruik nemen en netwerken van antiterreurcentra oprichten tevens dienen de rol en bevoegdheden van een co rdinerend antiterreurorgaan in brussel vergroot te worden
3481050 die zal er niet komen want daarvoor bestaat onder de burgers van europa eenvoudigweg geen steun
3481051 er wordt verwacht dat het rapport nogal wat stof zal doen opwaaien niet in de laatste plaats omdat er wordt gevraagd om een gewapende europese krijgsmacht die naar het buitenland gestuurd kan worden om in overzeese gebieden in te grijpen
3481052 the best way to get a good idea is to get a lot of ideas

3481055 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3481056 as a member of the white community i am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the white community first and foremost
3481057 when the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader
3481058 commit hundreds of billions of dollars per year to finance adaption to climate change especially in poor countries
3481059 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3481060 would not be in the best interest of the community
3481061 shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were one second were lovers and then were broken up
3481062 for power constrained data centers and weve talked to a few clients who are worried about breaking things because theyre pushing the limits of their power so hard there is definitely some value in it
3481063 but for just a server farm where youre talking about tens or hundreds of nodes theres not as much value as there would be with a desktop virtual infrastructure where you might be talking about thousands of nodes that could be shut down overnight when theyre not being used
3481064 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3481065 when you see something that was on film it takes you into the movie its almost like you are a character
3481066 on tv and thinking hey thats the theater where i watch disney movies
3481067 often simply being in a place is sufficient touchstone for their experience
3481068 theres gotta be a lot of stuff not just a blob
3481069 i take the ride but do i get it no
3481070 the volunteers who work all year half of them dont get it
3481071 their complacent desire to stuff themselves with goods and good times had shown itself to be a monster
3481072 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3481073 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3481074 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3481075 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3481076 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3481077 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3481078 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3481079 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3481080 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3481081 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3481082 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3481083 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3481084 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3481085 the ability to acquire this piece of property is really monumental
3481086 delay is the enemy of the everglades you dont come back from being poisoned
3481087 welcome to my library spider robinson make yourself at home
3481088 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3481089 we need the excesses skimming off the top it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitize everything
3481090 that is not what we are saying at all we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3481091 im slightly concerned ill be the first sent to the stands as i was last year for a rather innocuous decision last season
3481092 but i think the ideas terrific to cut out the excesses
3481093 at times and this came into sharp focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behaviour can become unacceptable
3481094 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone
3481095 its unfair to pick one person or player or one club
3481096 i could show you a hundred videos of players committing offences weve all done it
3481097 thats the past and we move on to make better every club and player who has committed an offence whether that be us haranguing the referees over the last year or so if we dont stand up and take that responsibility we wont move forward
3481098 weve all seen where we want to go and stop surrounding referees the respect is definitely there
3481099 referees have got a tough job and dont have access to replays
3481100 im from the drm elimination crew at defectivebydesign org id like to ask you a few questions about the defects apple has designed into the iphone 3g
3481101 it is useful to remember that all ipods play music that is free of any drm and encoded in open licensable formats such as mp3 and aac
3481102 work is either fun or drudgery it depends on your attitude i like fun
3481103 if you dont like texas weather just wait a minute
3481104 up to 10 inches of rain within a few minutes in a wide sweep of middle texas
3481105 do the right thing because its the right thing to do
3481106 an inheritance gained hastily at the beginning will not be blessed at the end
3481107 the experience of life shows that man does have a choice of action there are enough examples of heroic nature that show that apathy can be overcome everything can be taken from a person but one thing the last and greatest of human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances
3481108 be good and ill see you on tuesday if you cant be good call me and ill be straight over
3481109 the place where professional adults can learn english and exchange knowledge for free
3481110 you are hereby directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate to the 2008 democratic national convention in light of these comments
3481111 isnt there a right to free speech isnt this right in line with our time honored tradition with the dems
3481112 these intimidation tactics have a chilling effect on people feeling comfortable speaking up
3481113 we wanted to explore with ms millstone the possibility of her voluntarily resigning her position
3481114 as if this kind of thing was as natural and democratic as could be no big deal really
3481115 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee
3481116 if someone brings you private correspondence youll use that in investigating a complaint
3481117 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3481118 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3481119 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3481120 it sounded very totalitarian i thought it sounded undemocratic and i was completely shocked
3481121 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3481122 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3481123 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3481124 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up
3481125 clark gregg choke director knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads 1993 debut album pablo honey with creep over and over and over so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score
3481126 new old age from a front row seat im haunted by the knowledge that there is no one who will care about me in the deepest and most loving sense of the word at the end of my life
3481127 oh i remember when aunt peg was in the final stages of breast cancer mom said she wouldnt want another surgery if that happened to her
3481128 in the eighth inning when he came up for his third turn at bat the situation was critical the athletics were leading the yankees ruths team 3 to 1 the bases were full and two were out
3481129 the count was already no balls and one strike when babe took that magnificent swing missed staggered and went down he had literally swung himself off his feet
3481130 finally regaining his feet the bambino brushed the dust off his trousers dried his hands and got set for the next pitch
3481131 it disappeared over the scoreboard and cleared the houses across the street one of the longest hits ever made in baseball
3481132 as babe ruth trotted around the bases and across the plate behind the other runners with what proved to be the winning run he received a wild ovation from the crowd
3481133 in 1915 ty cobb set up the astonishing record of stealing 96 bases in 1922 seven years later max carey of the pittsburgh pirates set the second best record 51 stolen bases does this mean that cobb was twice as good as carey his closest rival ill let you decide
3481134 we find that careys average was much better than cobbs but cobb goes down in history as the greatest base runner of all time
3481135 w e now read of the amazing record of the immortal babe ruth with his unapproached total of 714 home runs but another unapproached worlds record of his is carefully buried in the records never to be mentioned striking out more times than any other player in history
3481136 but n obody will remember the times you struck out in the early innings if you hit a home run with the bases full in the ninth
3481137 this work is crucial to the well being of older people and the well being of healthcare in the united states
3481138 every physician in the united states needs to be educated about care of older people unless theyre going to do lifetime pediatrics

3481141 you dont expect a will to come into play for years
3481142 so if you want to change it you feel you have plenty of time
3481143 you look happy from the outside but you are not in inside
3481144 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3481145 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3481146 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3481147 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3481148 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize

3481152 comrade malema has erred but we still believe in democracy and as democrats we hope that he will continue to lead us into the future enforcing democracy and dictating democratic processes perhaps with military help if the voters wish it so for many decades to come
3481153 he has assured as that it wont happen again and as we speak he is returning to grass roots level by applying to the treasury for a new 7 series bmw

3481159 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3481160 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3481161 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3481162 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3481163 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3481164 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3481165 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3481166 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3481167 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial
3481168 reminds me of my mother i should get you some rose fragrance
3481169 not exactly sure i want to be the mother figure in your life
3481170 i dont suppose you want to walk around smelling like fresh bread do you
3481171 are you planning to come with me to dc next week for the reception at the white house for the repatriated women i got an email from the cos today if you are they want to make it a state dinner instead
3481172 i think it would mean a lot to the women but state dinners do usually get press coverage
3481173 it means that the president wants to go public with the portal
3481174 that was my reaction too there are some wonderful things about my world that would be incredibly beneficial here but the bad far outweighs the good i think theyre really pushing though i dont think theyll take my word for it
3481175 but youre the crown consort why would they not take your word for it
3481176 oh duh i liked the view better the other way
3481177 i declare slipping the linen shift over my head sticking my tongue out as i slide it down onto my shoulders
3481178 as far as the other goes of course i understand unless they can guarantee our safety frankly im surprised theyd even think they could make it public without people thinking theyd gone nuts
3481179 ill bet i can manage the pins ive taken them out enough one would expect i could put them in
3481180 hrmm one at a time would work better i think
3481181 is it possible they can do this state dinner without revealing the portal
3481182 i think it is an important day for these women and i would not want them to feel slighted
3481183 and i would very much like to see a little of your world though if were both to go we couldnt be gone for more than a very few days nor venture far from the portal
3481184 i will contact them and let them know our decision
3481185 something that we have to be prepared to deal with though eventually someone somewhere is going to find out about us
3481186 true enough but what id really like to know for now is why the change
3481187 i still dont see how it would benefit him you dont think peopled just think it was crazy
3481188 hes never done anything without being damn sure it would benefit him
3481189 i think were going to have to learn more about what theyre trying to do before we can react beyond saying that we dont want to be made public
3481190 second is to keep the integrity of the artists original vision and third make our product visible and available worldwide

3481196 after listening to reports on the developments in mauritania the escalating violence in somalia and other developments in the arab world the council affirmed that the best method to iron out differences would be by making reconciliation that puts national interests before partisan conflicts and ideological affiliations
3481197 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3481198 this is a rare event this event is more festive than any other celebrations that we have had so far
3481199 i was so proud of the kids for sharing their joy and love of the circus with their audience
3481200 in fact the show went so well ive invited them to come to a different kampong this week to perform for and help me teach the children of tanjung priok
3481201 is it easy or difficult for you to get drinking water
3481202 we have never had this kind of celebration before by joining this activity the people are able to get information and experience
3481203 the mixture must be shaken for 30 seconds and left to rest for half an hour before it can be consumed

3481208 singapore could become a very important player in islamic finance the government has put in place interesting initiatives to support the industry our decision to be in singapore is to compliment those very initiatives and help in training and educating the market
3481209 the launch of the sii islamic finance qualification from singapore provides the perfect tool for consumers in the region to gain the prerequisite background to assess wholesale instruments such as sukuk islamic bonds or retail products such as islamic mortgages
3481210 kfh bahrain is strategically positioned and adopts a pivotal role in the growth of islamic banking
3481211 islamic banking assets are currently estimated at 750 billion in value and will top the 1trn mark by 2010 this continuous expansion is being driven by an increased global demand for sharia compliant financial products and services

3481215 with indications of an exciting growth potential for islamic finance in europe euro wibc could not have come at a more opportune time as the industry stands on the threshold of significant expansion

3481223 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3481224 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3481225 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals

3481229 but with a surfeit of petro dollars in the bank and its fingers on the energy valves that keep europe warm the kremlin appears blithely contemptuous of any potential western retribution
3481230 the issue of energy and how we will we provide power for homes businesses transportation has gone from a back burner issue to a front burner issue thank goodness
3481231 there is no doubt that the science shows that climate change is happening

3481236 due to the fact that i didnt have to write a proposal and to enumerate advanced technologies i would be using to make this piece i was completely free to make what i think is meaningful and beautiful the pressure to be up to date with technology appears insane to me it doesnt bring any more beauty or pleasure instead it creates things that are hard to understand and impossible to handle so nobody can actually experience them beyond reading the artists concept
3481237 its degrading to have someone who just hired you to stick his hands down your pants
3481238 why didnt you turn around and knock him out right there

3481251 he was like the heart and soul of that team when it comes to defense protecting the basket and rebounding its tough to replace him
3481252 without camby i dont see any way that they can possibly win because he was a key guy for them
3481253 believe me i watched at least 70 games they played maybe more and he was a key guy
3481254 im sure it didnt make any sense to anybody from a basketball point of view

3481256 i think it was a good thought to bring in allen iverson i think allen is a tremendous offensive player but hes not a point guard that gets other people involved hes a guy that scores i think they just dont have enough to win
3481257 theyre a great offensive team but in the nba in the west particularly youve got to stop people
3481258 there are great teams out there its hard to outscore those teams they have not been a great defensive team they just have never seemed to be able to play consistently at a high level not necessarily defensively just overall i dont know enough about them to know all the reasons for that

3481333 investors realize it is just as important to hold onto what youve saved as it is to grow your investment nothing preserves the long term buying power of your savings like gold
3481334 the capital gold groups sponsorship of worthy causes and foundations is our way of giving back and sharing our success
3481335 we are maintaining our bullish outlook toward gold and silver
3481336 the stock market is not as good as before and people do not feel safe parking all their savings in banks
3481337 so they tend to buy gold as a means to hedge inflationary risks
3481338 in fact higher gold prices helped to stimulate investment purchases of the metal as consumers were attracted by the strong returns generated by the metal
3481339 the painted ladies greed and gullibility wave fetchingly from across the impassable river of easy money we plunge in eyes blazing blood roaring hot in our ears heedless of our good loafers avarice reduces our intelligence to that of little yellow crayons

3481350 we are maintaining our bullish outlook toward gold and silver
3481351 the market is really correcting itself but its a general move out of commodities its not just gold
3481352 but i dont think the bullish trend is over there is still buying interest but in the short term the market has probably overdone on the upside we are in a consolidation phase and gold may break back down below 900 again
3481353 i would expect gold to continue bouncing around in the range of about 955 on the upside and down to about 915
3481354 its going to take until the second half of the next week before the market is going to be ready to make a more convincing push upward again
3481355 the sudden price pull back across the precious metal complex during march has raised concerns that the bull run in this sector has drawn to a close we disagree

3481358 i have to say that this isnt a great time to be in the stock market
3481359 the housing crisis that we are going through is going to put a damper on the economy that is longer than a recession i dont see the stock troubles ending as quickly as many people are imagining
3481360 when you have extraordinary returns as we did from 1982 through 1999 then usually the next 10 years arent very good

3481412 unfortunate yes but not as was reported in the immediate aftermath of the presentation evidence that vistas security is useless nor does this work constitute a major security issue and its not game over either sensationalism sells and theres no news like bad news but sometimes particularly when covering security issues it would be nice to see accuracy and level headedness instead furthermore these attacks are specifically on the buffer overflow protections they do not circumvent the ie protected mode sandbox nor vistas in famous uac restrictions

3481423 i said i havent heard of any of these actors
3481424 then i ended up just falling in love with all of them
3481425 to be honest that was kind of the pull it was such a bizarro scenario it was so bizarre i kind of almost couldnt get my head around it but i thought god this is really going to be an experience this is a whole different culture this is a different part of america that i havent experienced and it turned out to be a positive
3481426 this is a guys comedy road movie and they need a reason to drive the story and its tobys love for this girl
3481427 life in the big city had brought home to her what home was and he was a part of that
3481428 i was actually amazed at how relaxed toby could be hes a really confident guy but hes also humble
3481429 he is very in the moment and actually quite good at improvising ive worked with professional actors way less instinctive than him it was a very nice surprise
3481430 as an actor you get used to being uncomfortable if youre not in freezing cold water in the middle of winter then youre bound and gagged
3481431 i mean i didnt know how big all these guys were i knew who willie nelson was but pretty much everybody else i didnt know and so i was learning as i made the movie and there were all these wonderful iconic country western guys who did cameos and toby would be so in awe and hed speak so highly of them and educate me

3481434 inflation is a compelling reason why clients would want to have a stock exposure in their portfolios depending on their age
3481435 what investors should be worried about is what are the future expectations for future earnings
3481436 for investors in the equity markets they need to think about which companies can grow their businesses in such an environment
3481437 who has pricing power foreign exposure and the ability to grow a business in a declining u s economy
3481438 it eats away at the purchasing power of the portfolio and as the fed raises rates it also decreases the value of the bonds
3481439 i expect inflation to continue because the fed is under pressure to keep interest rates low to combat the credit crisis
3481440 the demise of the dollar and why its great for your investments
3481441 we are in a recession and that will lead to a decline in other high cost items such as gas and groceries
3481442 those prices will come down in the next six months without the feds taking any further action on interest rates
3481443 we think the way to hedge portfolios from the effects of inflation is to invest in carefully selected stocks
3481444 stocks have historically since 1925 averaged about 10 percent a year and that beats inflation over that time period by 3 5 percent he also suggestions etfs such as rogers global commodity index rji protected bonds and reits
3481445 the emotion behind money building wealth from the inside out
3481446 are the only thing shown to outpace inflation in the last 100 years bonds savings accounts and cds are terrible now i think we are doing a great job as a country with inflation compared to the 1970s by keeping interest rates low but we are in uncharted waters and only time will tell

3481452 theres a lot of little details that companies offer im sure somebody thought this was a pretty good idea
3481453 people pay for anything for their pets these days i could see people wanting this
3481454 but nowadays people will spend thousands of dollars for their pets health and thats gotten publicity
3481455 what it means is it is for any fully domesticated animal and that can be a dog a cat a reptile or a rodent
3481456 it has to be a pet your pet cow that you plan to kill and eat does not count
3481457 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3481458 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia

3481464 helping the homeless is certainly laudable but government officials must not violate basic constitutional mandates in the process it is wrong for the city to subsidize religious worship and evangelism
3481465 we recognize that central union mission has done a great deal of good for the homeless and the hungry throughout its history
3481466 we also realize that the district faces considerable difficulties in addressing the needs of the homeless and that debates over the future of the mission and other city shelters have already generated a substantial amount of controversy but violating the constitution and d c law is no answer to the districts problems

3481472 we are getting a fraction of the number of people we expected besides we are not getting the target audience
3481473 it is alright for the likes of coke and macdonalds but anyone trying to market a slightly expensive item waits for the whole day to find few of the targeted consumer group
3481474 all three of them want to start thats what you want to see
3481475 i think all three of the guys we bring a different aspect to the game when we put it all together it makes us a very dangerous group
3481476 its a committee more than one person trying to win the starting spot
3481477 by the time everything shakes down well probably have two with a third that can do a bunch of different things usually those things work their way out
3481478 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3481479 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him
3481480 from august 4 onwards when troops were deployed on the highway smooth movement of trucks including petrol tankers carrying essential supplies to the valley and other parts of the state has been ensured
3481481 the movement of fruits especially apples from srinagar to other states is also being ensured the army for instance escorted 2 263 loaded trucks 487 empty trucks 764 buses 97 oil tankers 58 lpg and 1 212 light vehicles from jammu to srinagar in the last eight days

3481483 we would be increasing our headcount from 37 000 to 50 000 in the next five years and set up more centres most of our business would be focused on the third party solutions and a little bit on the captive sector
3481484 in the last quarter we made 10 acquisitions globally and there is lot of scope for replicating it in the country
3481485 hes been consistent i think he is responding well to the internal pressure of the program as well as the pressure of the situation he and mitch payne are working to become our starting kicker
3481486 im hitting the ball well distance wise but my accuracy is really lacking right now
3481487 i think its just a result of not taking as much time as i should have during the off season but right now im just trying to learn from our coaches mitch payne and the other kickers and pick up how they do things its been fun though
3481488 the key to our program is consistency and most freshmen go up and down when expectations are made very clear sorensen responded to our expectations so i think he might be the right guy but its when they dont respond when corrected that you start to wonder whether this is the right fit
3481489 the policy is partial to cdma operators as they are entitled to spectrum in both 800 mhz and 450 mhz bands in addition to being eligible to bid in the 2 1 ghz band
3481490 this defies trai s recommendations restricting a cdma operator opting for the 450 mhz band from bidding in the 2 1 ghz band
3481491 for even the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many

3481494 we will be discussing with the employees then we will work out something valuation is the job of the merchant bankers and the appointment of bankers will be done after talking to all the stakeholders on the ipo bsnl cm kuldeep goyal said
3481495 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourselves in the house of god which is the church of god the pillar stylos and ground of the truth
3481496 with the growing support and acknowledgment from companies like this it further promotes our mission and goal of one day being foam free in landfills
3481497 mike clausen has improved tremendously and hes in a good position to be the backup quarterback this move helps us because we have a need at safety and travis dixon is a guy that our team respects our coaching staff respects and hes a very athletic guy and a tough guy
3481498 ideally you have one guy at quarterback and you have consistency that way that just isnt how it always works out
3481499 youve got to be able to adapt and youve got to be able to adjust i think its a good situation to have a kid who started for us in clayton and has experience as a starter
3481500 i keep everyone positive and keep everybody motivated i have to be on point so that everyone else can get their job done
3481501 my backup michael clausen is a redshirt freshman hes doing a great job out here at practice hes going to be a real good quarterback he keeps me on my toes
3481502 because he knows what were running because he knows the whole offense
3481503 being a quarterback you get a feel for whats going to happen depending on routes structures and certain receivers
3481504 you kind of expect certain things and you kind of know where the windows are at
3481505 this is the most concentration the most intensity ive seen since ive been here and im going into my fourth year its a good situation
3481506 its good to have competition for the quarterback spot each person wants to start and you need a strong quarterback a strong leader to control the offense
3481507 my backup michael clausen is a redshirt freshman hes doing a great job out here at practice our competition stays on the field but he does a great job hes going to be a real good quarterback
3481508 we are looking to prove to everyone and ourselves that we can and will do well this season
3481509 it seems like i was in camp just the other day last year camp seems to go by a little bit slow and as games go by its an awesome time the first game will be exciting
3481510 our younger players have a lot of ability but we have a long way to go on execution
3481511 we are decent on both sides of the ball but i am not as comfortable as i was about our depth at certain positions
3481512 we got some young running backs a few touches in case harvey unga or fui vakapuna arent able to perform or get hurt
3481513 i have a lot of weapons and a lot of support
3481514 my job is just to manage everything ive got great talent around me now i just have to go out there and do it
3481515 the corner bit on the fake and max hall put the ball exactly where it needed to be
3481516 i cant walk away from the fact that we had some kids that were wrong and that maybe i didnt do the best job i could have in the thing
3481517 the thing that bothered me the most about the incident that was the most prominent was the fact that nobody said hey this is ridiculous
3481518 everyone is waiting to see how the elections will turn out
3481519 its kind of fun to get recognized for some of the things i did last year and this year
3481520 its all fun and games but you just have to work towards the end goal in the mountain west
3481521 theyre leaders on our team they have a tremendous attitude they work hard and they practice well as i would expect them to
3481522 this is the first time having a quarterback named as starter before the beginning of camp
3481523 so its kind of easy to get our flow together and start getting on the same page
3481524 what i dont like is the view of entitlement of if i am not going to play i am going to redshirt
3481525 i think a redshirt is to be earned now just because the player is on the team for one year and doesnt play doesnt mean that that year is a year he is going to have back eligibility wise
3481526 when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3481527 love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3481528 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week whilst holidaying in america peaches first met max 23 a harvard graduate in anthropology 2 years ago maxs band chester french played at the itv itunes festival where peaches was a co presenter of the show the acclaimed new boston band were signed by pharrell williams to his label star track a subsidiary of the giant interscope label their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts no further comment from either will be forthcoming
3481529 terwijl de 3g netwerkdekking over het hele land goed is
3481530 once i get the techniques down im gonna do that stuff but just trying to make plays is the way im getting noticed
3481531 its been a long time since i had freshmen two of them that were as talented as those guys
3481532 toughness the mentality that theyre not just cover corners but theyre physical theyve got great instincts and theyre smart
3481533 being an incoming freshman youve got to know a lot of stuff
3481534 one of the hardest things was learning new techniques along with stuff you bring to the table already its like a collaboration of yourself its just being open to everything
3481535 jeremy ross sean young and marvin the other true freshman we just try to make each other better
3481536 i really feel like it adds an importance to the first game that might not have been there otherwise its a league game it counts its going to affect a lot of things down the road
3481537 and certainly against a border state opponent traditional rival it ought to galvanize everybody i think it got our players attention several months ago when it was announced
3481538 i think that puts another form of positive pressure on our football program and we like that
3481539 i dont know if you talk about replacing dennis dixon theres a void there he became on of the greatest football players to put on a uniform and certainly one of the most dominant players in college football last year
3481540 having said that im fairly comfortable and confident with our quarterback position
3481541 chris harper is maybe the best guy with the ball in his hands of anybody on our football team if he demonstrates consistency throwing the football he will be in the mix
3481542 right now that type of decision would be his weve talked about him as a quarterback in this program and i feel pretty strongly as i think he does that we want to give that a shot
3481543 we asked for a photo with kidd and then he did the same he actually wanted a photo with us we buzzed out
3481544 soon the rest of his teammates walked over to us and started hanging around i turned my shoulder and there stood lebron james and kobe the rest is history
3481545 i turned bright red and speed talked im sure he didnt understand a word of my kiwi accent
3481546 i dont know its an area that if we can get the production we expect we have a chance to have a good offense
3481547 i think it puts the pressure on the players to make it clearly obvious that theyre the guy
3481548 they need to separate themselves from the crowd because it shouldnt just be obvious to me and coach friedgen who the starter is it should be obvious to everyone on the team
3481549 im at the top of the depth chart right now
3481550 i have a lot of confidence i know what it takes to be the starting quarterback
3481551 i definitely think everyone can contribute in a different area but were all competing to be the quarterback not one of the quarterbacks
3481552 you always want to know whos going to be your starting guy
3481553 its sad to see lattimore and ball go but now its my time to step up
3481554 ive been waiting for an opportunity to go out there and play
3481555 i think weve got two guys we can definitely win with
3481556 its going to hurt the defense because they really dont know exactly what kind of running game were going to bring
3481557 i think the term every down back is really non existent anymore
3481558 you better have two or three backs who can take the pounding and handle the workload of the position
3481559 not only will the fans enjoy a much bigger image with much better quality but the new system will allow for tremendous flexibility in terms of the information on the board
3481560 where we were limited to a static scoreboard of downs distance time time outs left and a handful of in game statistics the new video system will allow seminole productions to change the screen in game to reflect more statistics as well as coverage of other events happening on the campus and other games of interest around the country
3481561 the ribbon boards will provide a location for text messages throughout the game allowing a continuous flow of information about not only the game in front of them but those around the country as well
3481562 fans should notice a drop in the volume of informational announcements previously given on the public address system which will make for a more pleasant in game experience
3481563 it was pretty sloppy i think we had nine offensive penalties which was no good
3481564 we have to go back and look statistics are statistics and when you play yourself you dont know whos in there and whos doing what
3481565 weve added some credence to it but its not a catch all end all to what theyve done
3481566 even though we stopped the ball a little better we still have to run the ball better on offense
3481567 we kind of stopped the run but we still missed too many tackles and weve got to get that taken care of
3481568 i think chris conte is doing ok i think darian hagan right now after five days is playing as good as he has played since hes been here so thats really really good to see
3481569 he needs to keep it going and be consistent those two guys are kind of battling right now
3481570 weve been competing since last spring all summer and fall camp were gonna continue to do that im gonna push him and hes been pushing me so hopefully the best man will get it
3481571 i have to do everything i can to try to make the team better as well as myself
3481572 i came in thinking that i was the man and it was a wake up call for me i appreciated it it forced me to grow up and i understand that its not a game anymore its serious
3481573 im telling you that ball was moving left outside the uprights i was going to get what i wanted practice this afternoon
3481574 but somebody bumped it back in the magic of matt stover i guess
3481575 i think that was worse than kicking a game winner because you dont want to let your guys down
3481576 its being efficient doing quality more than quantity and its making sure that youre on top of your game and not just out there going through the motions
3481577 youre making sure that mentally youre in every kick so that when it does come time to replicate something like what we did on the field today or in a game then im able to produce
3481578 hes proven over such a long period of time that he is one of the premier kickers in the history of the game
3481579 he makes field goals his percentage and his accuracy is anybody better
3481580 theres always competition whether or not youve been in training camp by yourself which i have been several times or with a guy like piotr
3481581 its just a matter of me staying focused and getting ready for what i know im going to have to do in the season opener against cincinnati
3481582 matt stover never stops working he is 100 percent committed to doing whatever it takes to get his job done right
3481583 hes always lifting kicking and rehearsing then again he watches what he does so he can save himself for when it does count
3481584 you just go one year at a time and god willing you end up making a career out of it
3481585 nineteen years i guess you could say is a career right so its been a good run
3481586 hes more than a lead blocker he can catch the ball
3481587 hes the kind of guy we want on our football team

3481663 in the off season tight ends coach rob boras studied how other teams utilize their tight ends and he and offensive coordinator ron turner came away with a few ideas they are implementing in camp
3481664 some of the nfls most prolific offenses make extensive use of two tight end sets
3481665 the bears offense has quite a way to go before it is considered prolific but the bears are at the forefront of the two tight end movement last season the bears got more production out of their top two tight ends desmond clark and greg olsen than all but two teams in the nfl the chiefs and colts whats more the bears were the only team in the league to have two tight ends catch at least 30 passes and were one of only eight teams to have two tight ends catch at least 20 passes

3481667 yes the halo 3 s and call of duty 4 s continue to sell exceedingly well but its titles like wii play and guitar hero iii whose appeal to nontraditional gamers have made them the envy of rival videogame publishers the fact is that when you walk into a circuit city or a wal mart the games youre most likely to see these days are ones that will actually hold the interest of a nongeek thats not by accident games are increasingly being crafted with you dear average reader in mind several publishers have created separate divisions for these casual games as products aimed at the vast middle are known in the business

3481675 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3481676 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3481677 packing 411 gives holiday shoppers the upper hand on sending gifts when it comes to handling gifts santa has the advantage over everyone but with a little preparation and know how consumers still have some tricks up their own sleeves
3481678 weve seen some wild packages come through the door over the years
3481679 all that work to find the perfect gift can be wasted if the package isnt properly prepared for shipping

3481686 the tidal wave is sweeping the country even his own former allies are now voting against him
3481687 the thing that kind of made everybody gasp was when the officer took the back of the guys head and shoved it to the ground on his face
3481688 they both unloaded on me and i started seeing stars and the whole thing was just bam bam bam after that
3481689 someone had a chokehold and they were all on top of me and i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die
3481690 i didnt know my teeth were broken until i was spitting out loose pieces
3481691 the thing that kind of made everybody gasp was when the officer took the back of the guys head and shoved it to the ground on his face
3481692 had i not been rolling the camera and no one else was rolling the camera it might have just been swept under the rug
3481693 was there a point at which somebody slammed his face into the ground
3481694 when you start seeing that the officers are making arguments that are directly contradicted by this videotape it raises questions about how believable the police officers are
3481695 i never saw the bicyclist make any sort of swing at either of the officers
3481696 the investigation is underway and no conclusions should be drawn until all of the facts are available and the totality of the circumstances can be considered
3481697 everyone in our country is initially entitled to a presumption of innocence even police officers

3481701 its becoming almost like an arms race as to who can ban more things
3481702 san francisco bans plastic bags then la bans plastics then everyone else has to its ironic because the us was founded as a reaction to the colonists telling them what to do
3481703 this achievement marks the first time that the complete chain of electronics for the evla has worked together and represents a huge milestone in the project our congratulations go to our canadian colleagues and to the nrao staff members participating in this project this is a job well done

3481706 the iau damaged the public perception of science by the high profile spectacle of imposing by vote a controversial definition of a commonly used term
3481707 too often science is presented as lists of facts to be learned from authority instead of the dynamic open ended process that it really is the iau reinforced this misconception of science
3481708 the importance of the ongoing debate is that it provides an opportunity to show the public how science really works in an area of great interest
3481709 there are also many areas on which we will agree
3481710 im hoping our debate will give the public a better understanding of why these differing views on planets serve the different purposes of various kinds of scientists and will illuminate the extent to which those purposes are narrow or broad
3481711 this was comparable to or more than the number who voted in favor of the iaus planet definition in 2006
3481712 the public and even many scientists are confused about what this means and wonder if asteroids crossing the orbits of earth and even jupiter compromise their planetary status because these are objects that have not been cleared from their orbits
3481713 if pluto were half the mass of uranus it would still not be a planet
3481714 and if the earth traded places with jupiter earth would not be a planet its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table
3481715 the iau definition better worded may be useful for identifying those objects that gravitationally dominate their vicinity or perhaps those objects that managed to sweep up most of the mass of the primordial disk of the solar system but it does not help us understand which objects orbiting the sun should have similar physical characteristics
3481716 and it is those physical characteristics that we go to study with spacecraft
3481717 when i first started in this business a large fraction of planetary scientists were astronomers who had cut their teeth on earth based telescopes
3481718 since then weve been flooded with data coming back from close flybys orbiters landers and rovers most of the planetary science questions being asked today are geophysical and geological planetary science is merging with terrestrial science to become real comparative planetology only a small fraction of the planetary science community belongs to the iau anymore
3481719 for planetary scientists it makes more sense to have a planet definition that is motivated by the physical characteristics of the objects
3481720 it has no geology and in fact jupiter may have more in common with sub stellar brown dwarfs than earth by comparison i expect that when nasas dawn mission reaches ceres in 2015 we will see very interesting geology and possible evidence for a subsurface ocean the hubble space telescope has revealed ceres to be unique in the asteroid belt having round shape and a very smooth surface likely as a consequence of its icy mantle likewise pluto will be visited by nasas new horizons mission in 2015 to study its geology and atmosphere
3481721 its good for people to know that debate in science is the norm
3481722 science is dynamic science is argumentative science is continual testing and challenging science is not about something everyone has to memorize because some organization has given it its blessing
3481723 at the end of the day scientific debate is a tool we use to increase our knowledge and understanding it is also fun
3481724 i dont want to deal with this so ill just rely on someone else to do so

3481730 six months ago natural resources canada was warning that emissions from idling cars can lead to serious health problems and even death
3481731 now the health warnings have been completely removed from the website and recommended standards for idling cars have been significantly weakened
3481732 science tells us that thousands of deaths are caused by air pollution each year in canada and that vehicle emissions are a major cause of that pollution
3481733 clearly mr lunn preferred to pander to the interests of an industry instead of looking at the hard evidence and defending the health of canadians

3481760 you edited the rules so of course they say what you want
3481761 at some point the assembly is going to be under the voters scrutiny as the largest reason for ny state government not working well enough this year may be the state senates turn but the assemblys turn is not far off its almost predictable that 2010 will be that year and it would wise for good legislators to get and stay ahead of the problem for them that means intelligently stepping away from a good amount of what is engrained and habit and usual in the assembly so that when the voters start looking for culprits you are not one of the ones they choose you know indiscriminant voters can be

3481767 im not going to antagonize the republican majority by telling them were working together and then go out in the evenings and become so political that it becomes public and aggravates them
3481768 if i get the cooperation im seeking from bruno and the senate majority and they help me cut into this budget i will have to honestly state to the public knowing it will help them politically that they did what i asked them to do

3481803 i had a hard time finding your phone number when i wanted to call you
3481804 you should put the telephone number for the branch on the page that displays the branches and their address having to select an individual branch and the click contact is not intuitive and i dont always get there quickly enough to be satisfied with the current presentation
3481805 i dont like how the online cd purchase works it offers me the non partner rates when i purchase a cd and there is neither explanation or information that would make me confident to believe im going to get the partner rate
3481806 i was trying to find information about the new savings plan and could not locate the information this is very frustrating
3481807 this weeks update was a very big one so we are already way over 1 million
3481808 it is a huge milestone for us in our internet content store we have almost 9 000 sets and more than 1 600 video scenes available those numbers are growing every day and multiple niches and categories are available at our stores which our online clients appreciate
3481809 our idea of more bang for the buck was proven true these toxxxic 20 hour sets are our next step forward and it is a perfect time to release them
3481810 we are confident that these packs will be a top seller
3481811 my ambition is to come back here next season to have a crack at the apprentices title

3481816 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3481817 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3481818 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3481819 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3481820 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3481821 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3481822 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3481823 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong
3481824 we go to about three games a year and no one ever even mentioned it

3481827 home buyers increasingly want to know how their homes fit into the new environmentalism and real estate professionals need to know how to respond to that demand
3481828 were proud that weve been designing and building eco friendly homes for more than 40 years and we are excited to team up with ecobroker to share ideas and methods that follow these principles
3481829 in todays housing market despite the slowed economy green built homes are still the hot ticket its what buyers are looking for
3481830 it just makes sense to team up with mcstain to educate local real estate professionals how to recognize and market these features to homebuyers

3481857 he russian president dmitry medvedev told officials that the safety of russian citizens and peacekeepers in south ossetia had been restored
3481858 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible things like the continuance of british rule in india the russian purges and deportations the dropping of the atom bombs on japan can indeed be defended but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism question begging and sheer cloudy vagueness defenceless villages are bombarded from the air the inhabitants driven out into the countryside the cattle machine gunned the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets this is called pacification
3481859 i never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print

3481865 objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account
3481866 by using stale metaphors similes and idioms you save much mental effort at the cost of leaving your meaning vague not only for your reader but for yourself
3481867 as an englishman commenting on an american site i find this amusing to say the least
3481868 if you cultivate a 25 word ghetto vocabulary you just might end up with a personality to match
3481869 the word fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable the words democracy socialism freedom patriotic realistic justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another in the case of a word like democracy not only is there no agreed definition but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides it is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning

3481875 the routine lipid panel which measures total cholesterol hdl and triglycerides and calculates ldl has been shown to have a 40 percent predictive value for coronary heart disease chd
3481876 the vap test provides twice the predictive ability in indentifying chd risk compared with traditional lipid panels
3481877 this is a more advanced blood test that can far more accurately gauge your risk of heart disease
3481878 the vap test not only offers a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular risk but also supplies vital information that can help you and your doctor formulate a customized disease prevention program and measure its progress over time this powerful diagnostic tool can help people take the steps necessary to avoid preventable health catastrophes like heart attack and stroke

3481892 race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your lord and paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth prepared for those who believe in allah and his messengers that is the grace of allah which he bestows on whom he is pleased with and allah is the owner of great bounty
3481893 and they have been commanded no more than to worship allah offering him sincere devotion
3481894 actions are but by intentions and every man will have only what he intended so whoever emigrated for allah and his messenger then his emigration was for allah and his messenger and whoever emigrated to attain something of this world or to marry a woman then his emigration was for whatever reason he emigrated
3481895 the month of ramadan in which was revealed the quran a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days which one did not fast must be made up from other days allah intends for you ease and he does not want to make things difficult for you he wants that you must complete the same number of days and that you must magnify allah for having guided you so that you may be grateful to him
3481896 as for him who is given his book in his right hand he shall surely receive an easy reckoning and he will return to his family rejoicing but as for him who is given his book behind his back he shall call for destruction on himself and will burn in a blazing fire
3481897 and the quran is a proof for you or against you
3481898 whoever reads a letter from the book of allah he will have a reward
3481899 the month of ramadan is the one in which the quran was sent down a guidance for mankind clear proofs for the guidance the criterion so whoever amongst you witnesses this month let him fast it
3481900 do they not then think deeply in the quran or are their hearts locked up from understanding
3481901 the first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the day of judgment is the prayer if it is sound then the rest of his deeds will be sound and if it is bad then the rest of his deeds will be bad
3481902 when have finished performing the salah remember allah standing sitting and reclining but when you are free from danger perform the salah surely salah is enjoined on the believers at fixed times
3481903 the night prayer is offered as two rakat followed by two rakat and so on
3481904 the difference between our observance of the fast and that of the people of the book is eating of breakfast
3481905 eating the sahoor is blessed do not neglect it even if you take a gulp of water because allah and his angels invoke blessings upon those who partake in the pre dawn meal
3481906 if every muslim paid their zakat there would be no poverty in the world
3481907 these things cannot all meet in a single person but that they will enter paradise
3481908 whoever allah has given tawfique to they will never find any shortage of doing good
3481909 the one who shows somebody good is like the one who does it
3481910 whoever gives a fasting person food to break his or her fast he the one feeding will get the reward equivalent to the fasting persons reward without diminishing anything from the reward of the fasting person
3481911 umrah is an expiation for the time between it and the previous umrah and an accepted hajj has no less a reward than paradise
3481912 do you know something amazing right now 1 billion people on this earth are fasting today
3481913 o allah make it such that we arrive to ramadan
3481914 jasmines extensive experience in technical product marketing coupled with her sales knowledge makes her an ideal candidate to manage national sales efforts
3481915 eu acho que esse ano eu vou fazer o bolo
3481916 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3481917 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3481918 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3481919 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3481920 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
3481921 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3481922 weve been able to place some people ourselves in terms of our own operations on the island
3481923 at this point we know of 16 that have found work out of the 36 and we expect that number to grow
3481924 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3481925 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3481926 although our sales continue to be strong we are concerned about a general slow down in the economy
3481927 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3481928 we value our ongoing relationship with the usw and appreciate the contributions that our employees make to the success of our business
3481929 we believe that this agreement is in the best interests of our company and all of our stakeholders
3481930 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3481931 les prix du wti qui ont t en moyenne de 72 dollars le baril en 2007 devraient tre en moyenne de 119 dollars le baril en 2008 et de 124 dollars en 2009
3481932 laie confirme que la r alit de loffre et de la demande a repris le dessus cest ce qui explique le reflux des prix
3481933 le dollar a renou avec sa qualit de valeur refuge dans les moments dincertitudes son redressement depuis quelques jours p nalise les mati res premi res
3481934 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3481935 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3481936 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3481937 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3481938 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3481939 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3481940 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3481941 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3481942 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3481943 we estimate that we will deal with 2 000 people in these days
3481944 one of the topics to be discussed is the risks control particularly for peru which is a very important topic for the country due to the permanent weather changes here there is a few of everything such as earthquakes el ni o frosts and hailstones and many of these are frequent however they are considered phenomenon
3481945 this amount is calculated based on our 2008 goal of attracting at least 2 million foreign tourists who spend between 1 000 and 1 100 dollars during their stay in the country
3481946 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss unfortunately while there are a few bright spots like pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin that reached record high values most markets are likely to remain in negative territory for the next few quarters given the magnitude of current year over year declines
3481947 casinos were considered some time ago to be recession proof theyre not but the casinos themselves are pretty strong
3481948 while the complexities of this proposal have yet to be vetted it seems doubtful that this is the sort of idea that oregonians could get behind
3481949 democrats in the legislature would prefer to store our water here at home before shipping it off to california
3481950 first and foremost while not closing our minds to long term viable solutions for state funding we are committed to ensuring that oregonians and our agricultural community have the stable and sufficient water supply they need
3481951 we are in the middle of a state wide water needs assessment and we will respond to those needs before we divert our water anywhere outside of oregon senate democrats have demonstrated leadership on this issue and im confident that we will continue our record of smart and sensible water planning for our state
3481952 we will offset a portion of this inflation through our ongoing productivity programs but the exceptional nature of these cost increases has outpaced these programs and requires us to take this action
3481953 its hard to adapt new technologies to an existing plant
3481954 we are doing stack tests to determine the proper controls
3481955 there are no standards for mercury in the state or federally so when you say we are complying you are saying that you are doing nothing
3481956 i ask that of you for my children and grandchildren
3481957 if i dropped two or three ounces of mercury into a reservoir id spend my life in guantanamo bay
3481958 if lafarge can buy fire trucks how about an air monitor
3481959 we have a plan to install a particulate monitoring device
3481960 it will be freed up at the end of this year we are considering different locations
3481961 talking to the department of health to see if they have something
3481962 please be assured we will take a searching and probing look at the application everyone understands the current plant is not serving our needs or theirs
3481963 at this time there isnt one single technology that will capture 90 we intend to integrate something into the new plant but we dont know what
3481964 to extend the same concern for the health and safety and health of residents as you do for your workers
3481965 its a very emotional thing to have a person walk again when theyve been paralyzed
3481966 its very rare to make a full recovery because the spinal cord is a very sensitive part of our body and any injury to it is basically permanent i think hes a very lucky man
3481967 the last game of touch footy i played i fell over five times i thought i was getting uncoordinated but bigger things were happening
3481968 i just thought it was a bad back a pinched nerve
3481969 some may arise from birth sometimes after surgery or a minor injury they can develop but were really not sure why they come about

3481973 while fiercely competing in the marketplace does create some degree of tension or even mistrust between two companies that activity also creates a lot of common ground for discussion about the market and the future

3481989 continuation of the horrifying portrayal of disabled characters in entertainment
3481990 aapd is also disgusted at the use of the word retard numerous times in the movie and promotional items for the film
3481991 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities
3481992 although the movie is considered satire this depiction of a person with intellectual disabilities is far from funny
3481993 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3481994 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3481995 we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3481996 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3481997 us growth is doing much better than domestic spending would indicate both because exports are booming and because some of the weakness in domestic demand is being passed on to the rest of the world through lower imports
3481998 while rapid export growth has been a crucial support to the us economy that now appears under threat as the evidence from europe and japan shows a rising threat of recession
3481999 we are not buying a whole lot of goods from anywhere but with a lessening of inflation pressures from the drop in oil prices and the firming of the dollar the fed will likely stay on hold for quite a while
3482000 with an aim to finish it by the coming autumn
3482001 i believe it is a step forward that we have been able to agree that they will launch a full investigation again
3482002 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3482003 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3482004 so he is really the man for the job at this critical time in world history
3482005 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3482006 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3482007 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again and stop john mccain from shipping our jobs overseas
3482008 john mccain should be ashamed of himself not just for voting against protecting an american company like harley davidson but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in sturgis and pretending to be one of them
3482009 i believe they are the heartland of america and the judeo christian values they hold are the strength of america
3482010 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3482011 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3482012 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3482013 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3482014 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3482015 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3482016 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3482017 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3482018 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3482019 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3482020 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3482021 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3482022 this is simply not a time for politics as usual i have no doubt that a lot of republicans will be attracted to obama in spite of the flaws in this years primary process
3482023 there is a deepening split between the traditional nixonian realist wing of the republican party and the neo conservatives that has become more pronounced with john mccains hardline anti russia rhetoric
3482024 i have good reason to believe that there will be other republicans such as james baker the former secretary of state who may withhold endorsement from mccain rather than endorse obama directly
3482025 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3482026 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3482027 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3482028 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3482029 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3482030 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3482031 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3482032 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3482033 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3482034 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3482035 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3482036 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3482037 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3482038 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3482039 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3482040 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3482041 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3482042 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3482043 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3482044 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3482045 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3482046 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3482047 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3482048 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3482049 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3482050 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3482051 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3482052 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3482053 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3482054 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3482055 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3482056 our peacekeepers are continuing to perform their duties and will continue to do so because they are a key factor for upholding security in the caucasus
3482057 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3482058 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3482059 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3482060 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3482061 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3482062 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3482063 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3482064 until recently bhatia knew nothing about developing cities the 39 year old san francisco resident is an electrical engineer by training and profession and with a ton of cash in the bank the last challenge he thought he would face is the hassle of navigating indias cash under the table democracy while preaching sustainable development india with a population of 1 12 billion is beset with energy and infrastructure problems most citizens dont have access to safe drinking water
3482065 but now after spending 4 million of his own money and learning some hard lessons about international development bhatias project could be on the brink of starting this summer he partnered with a major indian developer that pledged funds to help purchase the land needed in the northern indian state of haryana to break ground on nano city
3482066 but major hurdles remain and the project could easily fail
3482067 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3482068 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3482069 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3482070 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3482071 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3482072 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week while holidaying in america peaches first met max 23 a harvard graduate in anthropology two years ago maxs band chester french played at the itv itunes festival where peaches was a co presenter of the show the acclaimed new boston band were signed by pharrell williams to his label star track a subsidiary of the giant interscope label
3482073 these numbers are obviously of special concern to the government as it the economy remains in a difficult time
3482074 supposing president musharraf is impeached how does that help me on a daily basis
3482075 i believe it was the holy koran which i keep with me in the truck that saved me from the bullets
3482076 in the summer months i would expect to be attacked once or twice a week
3482077 last week we were caught up in an attack on a convoy of fuel trucks on a road we are working on it looked like a war zone with five diesel tanks burst open by rocket propelled grenades and burning diesel flooding out over the road
3482078 the talibans new tactics of blowing bridges between kabul and kandahar forcing convoys to slow down and become softer targets is causing severe problems to companies trying to supply kandahar from kabul
3482079 stopping all non essential movement and offensive operations because of fuel shortages
3482080 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3482081 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3482082 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3482083 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3482084 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3482085 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3482086 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3482087 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3482088 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3482089 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3482090 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3482091 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3482092 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3482093 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3482094 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3482095 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3482096 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3482097 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3482098 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3482099 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3482100 conditions and events cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern
3482101 negative publicity relating to our financial results and the financial results of other financial institutions together with the seizure of indymac bank by federal regulators in july 2008 has caused a significant amount of customer deposit withdrawals thus affecting our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations as they have come due

3482106 we are getting anyone who has not received their solutions to call their congressman and senators to get their friends family and neighbors to call the ceos of banks we are giving them all their addresses and phone numbers
3482107 the only problem is ceos have a lot of property and there are a lot of doors to knock on but its personal and were going to make it personal
3482108 analysts pay close attention to the volumes and trend of nonperforming loans and thats a key performance indicator that analysts zero in on
3482109 our experience has been reasonably good in that 50 of these modified loans remain current with their modified terms after about six months
3482110 once a borrower gets into trouble its very hard to get out of it
3482111 the new stuff thats coming on is just overwhelming and theres so much noise out there for this to make an impact

3482121 we therefore urge all parties interested in new oil fields in northern areas to attend the conference in reykjavik
3482122 at the conference we will go through geological data on the area as well as inform on taxation and financial conditions

3482124 the san jose mine is producing high grade gold and silver ore from an underground operation this means we move fewer tonnes to produce an ounce of gold or silver which in turn helps us maintain lower costs per ounce we anticipate that production costs will trend even lower as the production is doubled and we receive the benefit of the economies of scale from the expansion

3482128 heute stehen wir an vorderster front zwischen europa und russland
3482129 unser kampf gegen russland ist ein kampf zwischen david und goliath

3482131 sie sind der entscheidende faktor f r die sicherheit im kaukasus

3482133 with the launch of the truth with jeff johnson along with all of our other in depth political coverage we are providing a unique and necessary perspective on the issues important to the black community
3482134 bet news is committed to informing our audience with the news they cant get anywhere else with a diversity of voices and opinions that our audience demands
3482135 we want to recreate the spirit that existed that people could actually make a change
3482136 i dont think we could ever be as media savvy as abbie hoffman but i think we need to learn from history
3482137 in 1968 you had a democratic party that was refusing to stop an illegal war and was criminalizing dissent in 2008 you have a democratic party that voted to continue the iraq war and the patriot act
3482138 the protests in the streets are just as integral to the political process as what happens on the floor inside the convention
3482139 if you are inviting the convention you are inviting the protests that come with it
3482140 we knew that recreate 68 was a provocative name but we were very clear that we didnt call ourselves recreate chicago 68
3482141 but we are not going to shy away from that either because what happened in chicago and this is according to the walker report was a police riot
3482142 ive been involved in other campaigns where it took us months to get any attention at all but the second we threw on a provocative name on a press release the next day i was on cnn talking to wolf blitzer
3482143 we have commitments from the immigrant communities who normally dont come out for the anti war stuff to come out
3482144 and the anti war folks in return are going to be supporting immigration its made a strong solidarity movement
3482145 no american should be put inside of a cage and told thats where theyre free
3482146 we are going to file our appeal in the street
3482147 we dont have any information that would cause us to believe that were going to have any significant problems in arapahoe county but i would be remiss if i didnt plan for the public safety
3482148 this is just another way to make us look like criminals instead of community members expressing our constitutional rights
3482149 what was going on in the convention hall in chicago was the nomination of a candidate who had not participated in any of the primaries or caucuses
3482150 the bigger impact of the protests was on the democratic party nominating rules
3482151 protests associated with national conventions have become so commonplace its hard for protesters to break through the normal background
3482152 part of it may also be whether the protesters can get past the idea of the protest being about the time and place they want to protest

3482157 theres a level of recognition and trust that weve managed to foster over the years it is something that we are very proud of
3482158 its a pleasure that we are able to offer schools rebates and other charitable programs through which they can do things like fund technology improvements bring in guest speakers or offer special assemblies

3482167 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
3482168 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as 2006s
3482169 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
3482170 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
3482171 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3482172 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3482173 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3482174 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3482175 we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
3482176 from the pulpit homophobia is preached by some arrogant religious leaders who think their beliefs are superior to our inborn and some would say god given nature
3482177 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3482181 he told me dont worry nothing will come of it
3482182 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3482183 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3482184 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3482185 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3482186 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3482187 weve worked with russia in terms of the wto accession and they still have a ways to go so its not as though theyre close to it they still have some work to do before they get to it
3482188 we should convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3482189 we are making progress on the last details of the negotiations i think it is important to finish this up
3482190 as i mentioned before russia has quite a bit of work that they need to do before their accession before we have to cross that bridge

3482210 the iau damaged the public perception of science by the high profile spectacle of imposing by vote a controversial definition of a commonly used term
3482211 too often science is presented as lists of facts to be learned from authority instead of the dynamic open ended process that it really is the iau reinforced this misconception of science
3482212 the importance of the ongoing debate is that it provides an opportunity to show the public how science really works in an area of great interest
3482213 there are also many areas on which we will agree
3482214 im hoping our debate will give the public a better understanding of why these differing views on planets serve the different purposes of various kinds of scientists and will illuminate the extent to which those purposes are narrow or broad
3482215 this was comparable to or more than the number who voted in favor of the iaus planet definition in 2006
3482216 the public and even many scientists are confused about what this means and wonder if asteroids crossing the orbits of earth and even jupiter compromise their planetary status because these are objects that have not been cleared from their orbits
3482217 if pluto were half the mass of uranus it would still not be a planet
3482218 and if the earth traded places with jupiter earth would not be a planet its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table
3482219 the iau definition better worded may be useful for identifying those objects that gravitationally dominate their vicinity or perhaps those objects that managed to sweep up most of the mass of the primordial disk of the solar system but it does not help us understand which objects orbiting the sun should have similar physical characteristics
3482220 and it is those physical characteristics that we go to study with spacecraft
3482221 when i first started in this business a large fraction of planetary scientists were astronomers who had cut their teeth on earth based telescopes
3482222 since then weve been flooded with data coming back from close flybys orbiters landers and rovers most of the planetary science questions being asked today are geophysical and geological planetary science is merging with terrestrial science to become real comparative planetology only a small fraction of the planetary science community belongs to the iau anymore
3482223 for planetary scientists it makes more sense to have a planet definition that is motivated by the physical characteristics of the objects
3482224 it has no geology and in fact jupiter may have more in common with sub stellar brown dwarfs than earth by comparison i expect that when nasas dawn mission reaches ceres in 2015 we will see very interesting geology and possible evidence for a subsurface ocean the hubble space telescope has revealed ceres to be unique in the asteroid belt having round shape and a very smooth surface likely as a consequence of its icy mantle likewise pluto will be visited by nasas new horizons mission in 2015 to study its geology and atmosphere
3482225 its good for people to know that debate in science is the norm
3482226 science is dynamic science is argumentative science is continual testing and challenging science is not about something everyone has to memorize because some organization has given it its blessing
3482227 at the end of the day scientific debate is a tool we use to increase our knowledge and understanding it is also fun
3482228 i hate that question what are you doing tonight what have you got to offer
3482229 hell be given one then hopefully through his attorney well be able to talk to him
3482230 i dont understand how anybody can hurt a child in any way especially this way

3482234 i know it is hard to believe its hard to fathom but this is mission accomplished for them they want americans to take transit and move to the inner cities they want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements and take light rail to their government jobs thats their vision for america
3482235 if they try to imitate fosbury he will wipe out an entire generation of high jumpers because they will all have broken necks
3482236 there were some doctors who felt i was threatening kids lives
3482237 spectators were in awe the first time they saw it
3482238 i remember the stadium was packed full with 80 000 people as i went from the warmups to the competition and the bar kept raising higher there were 80 000 people going silent watching this kid this gringo take his mark and rock back and forth preparing to take a jump
3482239 the problem with something revolutionary like that was that most of the elite athletes had invested so much time in their technique and movements that they didnt want to give it up so they stuck with what they knew
3482240 the revolution came about from the kids who saw it and had nothing to lose
3482241 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3482242 i first picked this up in bits and pieces last week off daily rotation a more in depth story is available at zdnet which reports a weeks worth of speculations around russian internet forums have finally materialized into the attacks have already managed to compromise several government web sites with continuing ddos attacks against numerous other georgian government sites prompting the government to switch to hosting locations to the us with georgias ministry of foreign affairs undertaking a desperate step in order to disseminate real time information by moving to a blogspot account there is a question whether the computer work is being done by the russian military or others zdnets story offers further analysis of the attacks themselves and their origins some pretty good reporting
3482243 we saw the reporting and the announcement from the russian president medvedev
3482244 were trying to get an assessment of what exactly it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3482245 lesley wasnt even aware that skip had been arrested hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail
3482246 one possibility is that if wed looked further out the benefits would go away
3482247 you only need to lose 5 to 7 percent of your body weight to have a major impact on glucose levels
3482248 when someone gets a diagnosis of diabetes its a little like cancer
3482249 she was in the vanguard of the movement she recruited a generation of young leaders
3482250 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3482251 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3482252 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3482253 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3482254 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3482255 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3482256 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3482257 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3482258 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3482259 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3482260 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3482261 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3482262 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3482263 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3482264 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3482265 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3482266 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
3482267 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3482268 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3482269 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3482270 its just letting it heal and doing the rehab and strengthening it more than anything
3482271 hell be able to work on his chipping and putting in pretty short order and i would think hell be able to practice that for a long time
3482272 if hes working out and he has swelling hes got to back off and let it calm down maybe then youve lost a day or a week or 10 days none of this has happened but its a possibility we just dont know the timetable he is on would put him back before augusta but youre really just guessing
3482273 as a two time defending pga champion it was a lot more frustrating not to be competing and that hurts the most
3482274 the thing i miss the most about not competing is the fight ive gone through this experience before so i knew what i was in for i know im in no condition to beat anybody right now so i dont have a problem with not being able to compete
3482275 i will definitely watch some of the ryder cup matches and will be pulling hard for the american team i wish i could do more than root
3482276 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year i just dont have a choice
3482277 we simply didnt know what type of swelling there would be i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3482278 im taking it day to day week to week all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day
3482279 the big thing is i have started my rehab and can ride the exercise bike i cant ride it hard but am getting in two or three sessions a day
3482280 initially i lost about 10 pounds because i wasnt working out all of that was muscle ive put about two pounds back on but im still pretty light
3482281 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year i just dont have a choice
3482282 we simply didnt know what type of swelling there would be i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3482283 im taking it day to day week to week all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day
3482284 the big thing is i have started my rehab and can ride the exercise bike i cant ride it hard but am getting in two or three sessions a day
3482285 initially i lost about 10 pounds because i wasnt working out all of that was muscle ive put about two pounds back on but im still pretty light
3482286 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3482287 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong
3482288 we go to about three games a year and no one ever even mentioned it
3482289 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3482290 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3482291 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3482292 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3482293 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3482294 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3482295 we were able to achieve strong revenue and earnings growth by continuing to exploit our strength in the low and middle income segments of the residential market and we are on track to meet our full year targets
3482296 make no little plans make big plans aim high in hope and work think big
3482297 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
3482298 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with
3482299 one possibility being considered is the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders
3482300 i am shocked by ci cis tragic death she was very popular with the staff and work colleagues
3482301 my sympathies go out to her family and friends everyone has been devastated by the events
3482302 she was so popular i cant speculate on anything to do with the inquiry but i dont know any reason why anyone would want to do this to her
3482303 as far as i know at this time two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get an education who have both worked hard done extremely well and graduated with good degrees have been killed
3482304 there is nothing that we are aware of at this precise moment in time to suggest why these people should be targeted
3482305 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3482306 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3482307 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3482308 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3482309 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3482310 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3482311 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3482312 hpv vaccine deemed safe and effective despite reports of adverse events
3482313 these include reports of injury and death and we are seeing a pattern of what we have termed atypical collapse
3482314 these include cases where a girl suddenly passes into unconsciousness either immediately or within 24 hours of vaccination and then revives feeling weak and unable to speak properly or exhibiting other neurological signs what we are concerned about is that girls are not aware of this possibility and could be crossing the road or driving a car and suddenly pass out

3482432 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focussed on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3482433 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club
3482434 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football all the rumours unsettle the players of course they do we could do without it that is why i want to end them right now

3482472 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3482473 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3482474 their refining margins would because of excess supply so there s no incentive at all for them to do that
3482475 if i was an oil company i would like to know in 10 years when i m going to have this refinery built what the eventual specs are going to be and what the emission standards are going to be
3482476 we d rather just be putting gasoline in the ground and letting our customers fill up their tanks but we re in a situation where we don t have the volume of gasoline that we normally do

3482553 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3482554 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3482555 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3482556 what we love about this campaign is that it speaks very directly to the ideas of self expression and individuality create your own gap is about creating your own look through mixing and matching pieces that best represent you its about conveying who you are and what you stand for through what you wear

3482568 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3482569 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3482574 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3482575 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3482576 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3482577 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3482578 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3482579 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3482580 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3482581 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3482582 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3482583 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3482584 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

3482586 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3482587 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3482588 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3482589 trabajar con ustedes no queremos estar excluidos de su proceso
3482590 encuentro continental de pueblos y nacionalidades ind genas del abya yala
3482591 si usted fracasa fracasamos todos los ind genas del mundo
3482592 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3482593 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3482594 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3482595 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3482596 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
3482597 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3482598 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3482599 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3482600 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3482601 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3482602 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3482603 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3482604 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3482605 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3482606 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3482607 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3482608 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3482609 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3482610 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3482611 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3482612 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3482613 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3482614 i do not know why i am so angry hurt upset etc
3482615 yes i am the leader of this company make no mistake however every member of this menagerie as you put it has significant skill in their own area and i would happily bow to their expertise when required
3482616 too posh and french sounding oh you wouldnt know the french all got blown up a long time back
3482617 remember the french at all any of em about last time you went outside
3482618 statement of action since im no longer needed here im going to take a look around
3482619 they are still in the room with the violet panel but i am starting to be concerned
3482620 yobo youre small enough to escape notice go knock on the purple door
3482621 olive can you detect anything down the eastern passage i swear something moved down there
3482622 theres something down there im sure of it either its waiting for us or hiding from us maybe if we move out of view it get curious and enter the hallway
3482623 come let us begone from this place i find it unsettling
3482624 make no mistake however every member of this menagerie as you put it has significant skill in their own area and i would happily bow to their expertise when required
3482625 in fact many of the unusual powers they possess such as the ability to read emotion states or the power to manipulate light were programmed into them by my ancestors and it would be foolish to discount the use of these gifts of the ancients just because their forms do not match the ideal
3482626 so in your absence sir i am to follow their commands
3482627 some of your uh friends appear to require assistance from a mental health professional and possess unsavoury habits

3482630 the distinguished president of israel wrote a few lines of lyrics called
3482631 thats exactly what i was thinking we need to do
3482632 ill be honest i suggested we go for a walk because what i really wanted to do was parade you around
3482633 its true babe i wish that every guy ive ever known since highschool walked by so they could see you with me youre absolutely gorgeous you know that im so blessed
3482634 because i like it when you can admit youre not perfect
3482635 and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me
3482636 thou hast made me king over a people as many as the dust of the earth give me now wisdom and knowledge for who can rule this thy people that is so great
3482637 every single time harassing the researcher ends up spreading the research
3482638 the bottom line is independent security research is how we get more secure networks
3482639 but because anyone can just say anything the way we differentiate whats true from whats not is to actually show the details that can be independently verified
3482640 our intention amp was to find out what vulnerabilities might be present and then determine how those might be fixed
3482641 no choice but to seek assistance from a federal court judge
3482642 reviewing the information to determine if there is any degree of substance to the claims being made by the students
3482643 the court stopped researchers from speaking about their research traditional academic research
3482644 it essentially decided that talking about security vulnerabilities was somehow forbidden
3482645 its one thing for academic purposes to do research its something entirely different to actually carry it out
3482646 the first amendment doesnt protect people from breaking the law its a fine line to draw between violating a law and freedom of speech
3482647 there is no denying it the system failed the active wrongdoing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong
3482648 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3482649 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3482650 goodling improperly subjected candidates for certain career positions to the same politically based evaluation she used on candidates for political positions in violation of federal law and department policy
3482651 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department
3482652 we havent announced any of the discussions that have taken place with any outside parties that are interested in the brand
3482653 its something that i havent seen since i was a kid
3482654 i cant speak for what is considered funny in spain i dont know if it has the same impact that it would here its clearly racist and not even in a jovial way
3482655 this is coming from grown men who are supposed to be representing their nation
3482656 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3482657 typically these kind of things have little impact on the bids themselves
3482658 lots of people are asking how is this going to impact madrid 2016 my reaction is it wont
3482659 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with
3482660 i actually think that patients think that the risk is a lot higher than it is so i hope that this paper somewhat reassures them that their risk of recurrence after they are five year survivors is probably not as high as they think it is
3482661 that was certainly a finding that we were surprised to see
3482662 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3482663 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3482664 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3482665 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3482666 no matter what they do no matter how much they bomb us no matter how much they cripples us georgia will never surrender
3482667 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3482668 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3482669 hey a bunch of americans are eating there it must be okay
3482670 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3482671 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3482672 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3482673 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3482674 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3482675 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3482676 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3482677 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3482678 henri j nouwen a priest born and educated in the netherlands
3482679 henri nouwen spent his life helping people respond to the universal yearning for love unity and communion that doesnt go away
3482680 today i personally believe that jesus came to open the door to gods house all human beings can walk through that door whether they know about jesus or not today i see it as my call to help every person claim his or her way to god
3482681 teaches a course on the spirituality of henri nouwen at fuller theological seminary
3482682 h e withdrew in order to look inward to learn how to love god and be loved by god
3482683 wordiness in prayer often subjects the mind to fantasy to and dissipation
3482684 81 emphasis mine and this is what evangelical leaders like chuck swindoll and david jeremiah open their readers up to by their quoting this fool in an approving manner
3482685 the quiet can help us descend with the mind into the heart
3482686 find satisfaction in a certain word and stop at that point
3482687 but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do
3482688 i was at the olympic training center in colorado springs and glenn eller was in houston shooting by himself
3482689 all of us are now shooting together in the marksmanship unit with great competition day in and out among us and its just improved all of our games
3482690 the hardest part of this olympic experience is waiting for the day to get here
3482691 i wanted to compete at the highest level of clay target shooting to do that i had to commit myself to the sport the u s army and the usamu have given me the necessary resources to compete and win at the level required to win an olympic medal
3482692 the olympics were greater in every aspect than i had anticipated both in highs and lows the emotions involved are so great because of the years of training that go into that one day of competition
3482693 over 12 years 353 participants 11 9 percent had incident coronary heart disease related deaths
3482694 it was his idea that instead of sitting here waiting for a major wind developer to come to us amp to instead take matters into our own hands
3482695 i didnt know anything about wind i was just a landowner farmer but it seemed intelligent
3482696 but this is one emergency we cant dill our way out of
3482697 some of the biggest tree huggers are against it i dont see why anyone would be against wind power
3482698 some people point blank dont like the looks of the turbine my wife and i love the look
3482699 farming or driving a truck are the only jobs around
3482700 at first the idea was hey this is going to be the largest land owner windfarm in the country until you know the facts its easy to dream big
3482701 we had a lot of negotiating power in the first proposal
3482702 we came up with a plan where everybody benefits regardless if you get a turbine or not
3482703 it allows for proportionality while ensuring its not the dominating factor you get the best of mmp without it being overpowering that is the reason why
3482704 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3482705 but they dont understand that brett made those guys better than they were
3482706 people think its the system but it aint no damn system brett favre just knows where his guys are going to be at all times and i dont think aaron rodgers has got that yet
3482707 thats been the focus of my whole summer the green bay packers
3482708 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds
3482709 would not be in the best interest of the community
3482710 not only for us but for himself there are so many people out there who dislike him its safer for him to stay in jail
3482711 your shits soft like wheat bread on your own block you make shit they wont knock
3482712 i can do all things through christ whom strengtens me

3482716 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress there is still much work to be done what we want is to secure the best result
3482717 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery

3482724 he was running for president and had he won the nomination imagine what that would have done

3482728 ashen tree ashen tree i pluck thee this night my true love for to see
3482729 but reports indicate russian military forces have continued attacks in some areas and the situation remains fluid and dangerous
3482730 today the killing goes on and the aggression goes on
3482731 he wanted me to say thanks to you and give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america

3482869 pure play music offers independent artists an immediate strategy for creating consumer awareness of their music thus monetizing their talent and efforts
3482870 retail chains throughout europe and the u k are delivering vast exposure for independent artists something that could never be achieved through myspace or other online opportunities
3482871 in store music continues to be a major differentiator for retailers to create a shopping experience
3482872 but in todays music world independent artists define what is new hip and trendy
3482873 at the same time we have quickly penetrated major retailers because they can differentiate their shopping experience with new fresh sounds while reducing their cost to license music by 80 percent by using new independent artists instead of mainstream acts we have found that retail airplay along with online movie commercial and video game placement services provides a huge revenue opportunity for artists who sign with pure play on a non exclusive basis to merchandise their music through alternative venues
3482874 we have finally cracked the code by introducing independent artists to new audiences worldwide thus providing them with an income stream based on the quality of their work
3482875 including boosters for launching high into the air or accelerating at break neck speed on the ground

3482903 the message never stated but constantly emerging is that we all have our self justifying myths we tell ourselves a story of our lives in which we almost always appear as the heroes these myths prevent us from engaging with climate change the most powerful story of all endlessly narrated by the hired hands of the fossil fuel industry just as it was once told by the sugar slavers is that we are both all important and utterly insignificant we are too important to be denied any of the delights we crave but too insignificant to exert any impact on planetary processes we fill the whole frame of the story when it suits us and shrink to a dot when that scale is more convenient we are capable of occupying both niches simultaneously it is not just because the great global warming swindle is at odds with the entire body of scientific knowledge on this subject that i have bothered to contest it it is also because it is consonant with the entire body of human self deception we want to be misled we crave it and we will bend our minds into whatever shape they need to take in order not to face our brutal truths

3482991 the benefit of being in texas is we will have positive employment growth somewhere in between 1 5 percent and 2 percent
3482992 nationally however one source of continued economic weakness is the credit crunch that began last year as lenders have become much more cautious after a credit binge earlier this decade
3482993 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

3483034 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3483044 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3483069 but i dont think theres anyone around here who hasnt seen one
3483070 bright shaft of light beaming down out of the sky
3483071 it looked like it was about 200 yards off the road hovering over an open field
3483072 it was impossible to determine the size or shape because of the darkness anyway we saw four lights that looked like portholes red green amber and white we figured they were about three or four feet apart all in a row
3483073 we just stood there and watched it for about 10 minutes
3483074 then all of a sudden the lights went directly up in the air with absolutely no noise and just disappeared over a hill
3483075 i was lying on my bed i wasnt asleep when i saw a flashing light
3483076 it didnt have any chopper blades on top like a helicopter just some rotary like blades in front where an umbrella like part extended up it was about 30 or more feet long very beautiful light colored body with a darker tail
3483077 there were no lights on in our house at the time i watched it for about one or two minutes it was about 200 or 250 yards from my window flying below the oak treetops
3483078 we didnt try to go near it as we had company coming at the time
3483079 roy started speeding up to get a close look at it
3483080 he was doing about 70 miles an hour but we still lost it we got to the creek area and there were some other piedmont people standing on the road looking at it
3483081 i slowed down and watched for five or 10 minutes
3483082 when the lightning flashed i could see a dome shape with sort of an antenna at the top this amber light was shining from the antenna all the other lights were off i would say the thing was between 15 and 20 feet in diameter it wasnt making any noise at all
3483083 i was feeding cattle at the farm just about dark and i saw this thing come down over brushy creek
3483084 it was about a thousand feet in the air and shaped like a top i couldnt tell if it was rotating or if the lights were just flashing the lights were yellow green and red they couldve been portholes for all i know the object sailed over the farm and didnt make a sound
3483085 i cannot explain the object it is not a lens flare or light reflection
3483086 like a barrel with protrusions like arms sticking out of it
3483087 the only way i could see the shape of this thing was when the object seemed to tilt a brilliant white light appeared to go behind it the object was tilting from a vertical to a horizontal position and then back to a vertical position again then it moved straight up and disappeared into the night sky
3483088 it looked like the lights were red white and yellow there was no sound we tried to make out the shape but each time the lights went out we could see nothing we watched it for four or live minutes until it circled out of sight
3483089 bright light moving right under the surface of the lake
3483090 aimed a flashlight beam at the traveling light and it went out immediately
3483091 and there it was hovering about 1500 feet in the air and about 200 yards from me
3483092 it was a round saucer shaped object about 25 to 30 feet in diameter
3483093 i kept walking and got to within 100 yards of it i looked at it for two or three minutes until it darted behind the power plant almost like a blur i went north of the power plant to see where it had gone and found it hovering over a water intake pump on the other side of the station i stood there for a couple of minutes and watched it
3483094 is the way this object moved rapidly with no effort and perfectly silently
3483095 a big orange light glowing from white to orange it appeared to just go out and then would come back on
3483096 and every time it blinked it shot up 10 feet when it got about 300 to 500 feet in the air red and green lights came on and then the object flew horizontally
3483097 actually the red and green lights were very dull in comparison with the white light which was so intense that our eyes couldnt adjust to it the light was almost blinding the farther away the object got the better you could see the other lights
3483098 these people say that when the tv starts rolling and reception gets bad they can go outside and see a flying object
3483099 saw this thing in the air off to the side of the road
3483100 the object was hovering just above treetop level off to the right of the road there is a possibility that it came up from the ground and stopped right above the trees
3483101 a light no visible body or object attached to it white in color with some yellow
3483102 we saw this fellow walking up the road toward us in a frogmans outfit he was wearing flippers or something resembling them on his feet and he was carrying something in his hands
3483103 we couldnt see very well visibility was poor so we couldnt see his face but his body was completely covered the suit didnt look wet black river is about a quarter mile away from the road but its rather inaccessible from the point where we ran into this figure
3483104 the temperature was well below freezing and i dont know of anyone who lives in that area
3483105 i dont know what were seeing but i do know were seeing something

3483109 die fortgesetzte verschlechterung des wachstums kombiniert mit einem r ckgang des lpreises um 30 gegen ber seinem h chststand gen gt vielleicht um den markt davon zu berzeugen dass boe gouverneur mervyn king einen geldpolitisch gem igten kurs einschlagen wird
3483110 die boe kannte die daten als sie vergangene wochen den leitzins unver ndert lie das spricht daf r dass das zunehmende d sterere bild f r die wirtschaft die notwendigkeit einer strafferen geldpolitik berwiegt

3483194 we are pleased to see these candidates actively seeking the vote of gun owners the fact that their first appearances together at the same event isnt just a group of gun owners but this organization speaks volumes as to how far we have come in making gun owners voices heard loud and clear in statewide politics

3483196 t he question of whether to nationalize an issue in the name of the constitution calls for an exercise of judgment and when the nation is deeply divided over an issue to which the constitution does not speak with any clarity and a uniform national policy would override differences in local conditions nationalization may be premature
3483197 reigning theory of legislative interpretation in the eighteenth century which was loose or flexible or nonliteral construction
3483198 heller decision is exposed as an example of loose construction
3483199 there is an important difference obvious but often overlooked between using loose construction to prevent making the constitution a straitjacket and using it to make the constitution a straitjacket
3483200 preference for judicial modesty for less interference by the supreme court with the other branches of government cannot be derived by some logical process from constitutional text or history

3483207 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3483208 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3483209 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3483210 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3483211 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3483217 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3483218 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3483219 its amazing to come home from your first games with any sort of bling

3483223 i think that with the footage weve got someone will know who this individual is and wed certainly like to have a talk to him about his bladder problem
3483224 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3483225 it hit me when i was given the medal of honor over at the ellis island thing you know because my parents came over from italy although i was born here in new haven connecticut but you know i took it upon myself to speak that day about the people that were around me generals admirals police chiefs everything that you could possibly imagine all from different parts of the world who have come to this country to make this great country and people forget that you know people forget that they came from people from the other side you know its an amazing country people just dont realize how wonderful this place is and they just take it as a lock and oh yes i deserve this you dont deserve anything youve got to prove that youre a good american by being an american thats what i feel anyway
3483226 and they just take it as a lock and oh yes i deserve this you dont deserve anything youve got to prove that your a good american by being an american

3483229 un titlu olimpic nu i schimb via a poate doar percep ia asupra a tot ce ai dat sportului care i a adus cea mai mare satisfac ie g ndul c dac e ti suficient de puternic mental nimeni nu iti poate sta n cale
3483230 son unos buenos principios para solucionar el problema y para salir de esta situaci n dram tica
3483231 no hemos llegado a la paz pero estamos en un cese provisional de las hostilidades
3483232 la soberan a es la supremac a de los poderes centrales y rusia desde luego reconoce la soberan a de georgia
3483233 pero este reconocimiento no significa que el estado soberano pueda obrar a su antojo
3483234 si rusia tuviese otra posibilidad de reaccionar a la agresi n desatada por georgia contra osetia del sur la utilizar amos pero no ten amos ninguna otra posibilidad de reaccionar
3483235 en cuanto a las afirmaciones del presidente georgiano de que ellos observaron el alto el fuego durante dos d as se trata de una mentira
3483236 las normas de relaciones internacionales de acuerdo con las cuales operan las fuerzas de paz rusas fueron formuladas en 1992 y refrendadas en documentos internacionales de pocas posteriores dichas normas siguen en vigor
3483237 porque era dif cil el estar en contacto han hablado con los m s cercanos colaboradores
3483238 nos veremos obligados a adoptar otras medidas para impedir la repetici n de la situaci n que surgi como consecuencia de la agresi n georgiana
3483239 llevaron la verg enza a s mismas como fuerzas de paz cometieron cr menes y dispararon a camaradas con quienes sirvieron en la misma unidad de fuerza de paz
3483240 he tomado la decisi n de poner fin a la operaci n para forzar a las autoridades georgianas a la paz
3483241 i dont think i am good enough to be in architecture
3483242 personally i think its a top four decision im prepared to say that
3483243 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3483244 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3483245 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3483246 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3483247 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3483248 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3483249 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3483250 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3483251 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3483252 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3483253 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3483254 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3483255 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3483256 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3483257 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3483258 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3483259 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3483260 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3483261 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3483262 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3483263 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3483264 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3483265 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3483266 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3483267 we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3483268 rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress
3483269 both candidates recognize im sure that this means they will confront an entirely different strategic map of europe and central asia than they anticipated
3483270 russia and the united states are no longer mortal enemies
3483271 there is a fundamental difference which is sen mccain wants to isolate russia and he thinks that is a way to change their behavior
3483272 resist the temptation to be drawn into a military conflict
3483273 according to last 2 weeks sic sell off it looks like its going to be ugly
3483274 would not be in the best interest of the community
3483275 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3483276 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3483277 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3483278 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3483279 people care about each other by bringing people together it makes a difference
3483280 because weve been planning this now for the last three weeks and kind of immersed ourselves in this project you know were ready
3483281 we came up with an idea to do some fundraising i have twelve local artists who are going to painting chairs and then theyre going to be raffled off
3483282 our marketing team is really helping with the public relations and communications
3483283 weve been asked to come in and do some of the trim work maybe installing kitchen cabinets
3483284 its not always about those things that we often perceive as being heroic heroic is simply taking the time out of your life to change another persons life thats what i consider a hero

3483293 positive sentiment seen at the end of the first quarter that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived
3483294 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3483295 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3483296 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3483297 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3483298 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3483299 please explain how you will tax corporations and not have them pass that cost on to consumers
3483300 easy they might not make 11 billion dollars in profit one quarter
3483301 at the opening ceremony they cordoned off an area at the back of the stadium for smokers it did last nearly five hours

3483304 market conditions have become more challenging particularly in the us
3483305 however the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive and our broad portfolio of brands and fee based business model positions us well to take full advantage of this
3483306 its very clear that were in for a dose of stagflation with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing
3483307 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3483308 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3483309 the governments unjust public sector pay policy means that our members are having to cope with the biggest rise in inflation since records began on a real pay cut
3483310 when the sun sets all that energy thats been stored by the earth absorbing it is re radiated and we harvest it
3483311 our design goal was to get away from silicon wafers and rigid substrates
3483312 our current techniques only allow us to make a master template about six inches in diameter
3483313 weve had to stamp six inch regions stamp and repeat and mosaic them together to get a larger sheet
3483314 we chose to design our antennas at these longer wavelengths for proof of concept because theyre easier to manufacture for larger devices at that scale
3483315 were a national lab our goal is to get technology out to the private sector and we want to get technology thats going to be affordable
3483316 generation one of commercial solars cells right now are about 12 percent efficient at taking solar energy to power
3483317 our design shows that we can leapfrog that and go up to about 50 percent efficiency
3483318 even by an automobile engine the exhaust just goes out as waste so the concept is instead of letting it just go to ambient air is convert it back to electricity
3483319 were working on some designs where you do thermal energy management theyre like heat sinks sponges that can absorb certain wavelengths of energy

3483323 we let you handle capture retention archiving and content management to manage your content proactively because the information has already been retained classified and managed
3483324 they are expensive because organizations often have to expand them to deal with other cases and typically these solutions dont address the bigger problem of information retention
3483325 we want e discovery to be part of the basic daily process rather than having you run around putting out fires
3483326 nobody has the breadth anymore to cover all databases all repositories it requires a very large set of capabilities and ibm global services and eds are among the few entities that folks love to help solve that kind of complex problem
3483327 a very important part of the ediscovery process is that the tools you use must respect things like deletion policies and keep accurate logs of access and searches

3483330 to admit to others that i yearned for a long term commitment or marriage sounded regressive as soon as it emerged from my mouth
3483331 it was atavistic in nature a throwback to a time when women couldnt financially support themselves it was a piece of treacherous anathema in the age of strong independent working women
3483332 we are told that its best to meet friends of friends

3483347 before the downpour let me just say that my new movie my best friends girl is the best funniest film ive done yet
3483348 that being said let me address the fact that although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3483349 speaking about a party since it involves so few people seems to be an exaggeration to me
3483350 if it was about a party seeing that this party had no intention to overthrow the government or resort to violence this sentence seems to be exaggerated and contrary to every interpretation of the law

3483355 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact banging his videographer
3483356 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator

3483416 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3483417 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
3483418 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
3483419 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see

3483444 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3483445 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3483446 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
3483447 we really feel that justice was done here we are thankful
3483448 she took responsibility she manned up and admitted what she did
3483449 from the moment that chandler was born he lit up our lives his beautiful spirit was broken down by the monster sitting before us he tore our entire world apart no prison could be as bad as what chandler was put through
3483450 he took my beautiful grandson from me he did this knowingly and with malice and hate in his heart and he did it to destroy my daughter i hope every day he suffers the way my baby did i want him to live in the terror chandler must have lived in he is a monster i miss chandler every single day i have a new grandson that will never know chandler except from us
3483451 it would be an understatement to tell you this case was horrific
3483452 that community is suffering a huge loss its horrible its beyond belief what jon phillips did when i talked to my 7 year old boy this morning
3483453 there is not a sentence long enough for jon phillips he deserves the maximum you can give him thats what justice requires
3483454 the cat that basically must have exploded in the closet
3483455 the absurdity that cat droppings would account for the amount of feces found in the closet on the box and the air mattress
3483456 and ask yourself how someone cleaning up cat droppings would smear them all over the air mattress and the bottom of the closet shelf
3483457 after jan 11 jon phillips thought no one was watching chandler any more and thats when things changed dramatically
3483458 he forgot someone was watching a really smart 5 year old boy who led us to the evidence
3483459 at some point of screaming for food and water he probably gave up and only dominic could hear his pleas
3483460 chandler had ceased growing long before he succumbed to starvation and dehydration
3483461 in the end you have to ask yourself did they prove this to you
3483462 this is not the most serious charge you can be charged with first degree murder this is someone who missed the signs
3483463 those people had every reason to be upset by what they saw
3483464 if youre gonna do a cover up wouldnt you pull the carpet pad too
3483465 what has to be done to a child for a child of 7 to describe himself as not good enough for food
3483466 what 7 year old has the concept of going to jail if he lies
3483467 who does this who puts a child in prison who does this to a photograph and then displays it for everyone to see
3483468 he chose to deprive this child of food and water knowing if you do that the child is going to die
3483469 being beaten was just the starting point for chandler he was being beaten and abused and he was being programmed not to talk about it
3483470 i get in so much trouble when you interrogate me
3483471 chandler would beg me for food sometimes they would feed him sometimes they would not
3483472 he showed you through those drawings what happened in the closet
3483473 chandlers little body tells you he wasnt even allowed to be comfortable in this cell chandlers little body tells you he was in this closet for a long time
3483474 by may of 2007 jon phillips had had enough of chandler grafner
3483475 his motive against this child is spelled out in bruises from that school in january to the morgue in may he had a choice to make based on self preservation jon phillips had a choice to make he chose a dead body over explaining a sick and battered child jon phillips chose a dead body over having to explain an injured child again
3483476 a dead body doesnt talk doesnt talk about the closet about the bruises and a dead body wont put you in jail
3483477 who on this planet would look at this child and say hes just a little sick he was a living corpse
3483478 they show you that this man knew he had a corpse in the closet
3483479 vent the odor of chandlers demise out of this apartment
3483480 on may 4 what did they do they went to wal mart to buy more things to cover the stench of this dying boy
3483481 his eyes were open but he wasnt able to talk because his throat hurt
3483482 anything less than guilty of murder in the first degree is not the full measure of justice that the evidence shows you
3483483 anything less than that is a gift of mercy to a man who showed none
3483484 unless the blood had totally degraded and has mold growing in it
3483485 i dont need a pediatric pathologist to tell me what the findings were in this case
3483486 it would not at all affect the liver changes or the pancreatic change
3483487 you would agree that his appearance is not normal correct
3483488 based on the one measurement in the blood he did not have acetone in this blood however that did not negate the likelihood that he had diabetes with severe hyperglycemia
3483489 because parents usually take their kids to the hospital when theyre sick right
3483490 this is something that takes months to develop if not years
3483491 confirmed my belief that he had diabetes as a cause of his wasting and dehydration
3483492 so the elevated levels of glucose showed that he had elevated levels of glucose in his body for a long period of time weeks
3483493 the body has to shift for metabolic reasons to using up fat and protein stores in muscle tissue for energy
3483494 the main factor in our decision was whether we wanted to make dominic participate in a prosecution where his father could be put to death
3483495 if you allow a child to go back and back and back certainly it will set a memory that may overtake what really happened
3483496 when you develop a therapeutic alliance you are sending a signal to the child that no matter what is said or how terrible it is you are with a person who is nonjudgmental and you can say or do anything thats different than what you do in an investigative interview
3483497 he was acting like a good parent while you were watching wasnt he
3483498 he knew you werent coming back to that house after jan 11 2007 didnt he
3483499 they were doing awesome chandler sang me songs he was going to sing in the thanksgiving play at school dominic sang songs and counted
3483500 my mommy and daddy did bad things they made me take showers they didnt take care of me and made me eat fish
3483501 dominic said he had never been in the closet and seemed surprised by the picture
3483502 i hate fish i want the fish to be kicked in the face fish makes me puke
3483503 dominic said his brother often asked for food and that his brother was hungry
3483504 he said he asked his parents for food he said chandler asked to get out of the closet often and that it was very scary in there he said sometimes they would let him out and sometimes they wouldnt
3483505 he was screaming for food and water and to get out of the closet chandler looks very skinny
3483506 his big brothers eyes were open and looking at dominic
3483507 he said chandler wasnt able to talk because his throat hurt dominic said it felt very sad
3483508 became very distant and numb his voice became quiet and quieter wasnt able to look at me in the eyes
3483509 i noticed several stains more heavily on the outside of the carpet there were some reddish brown stains that smelled heavily of urine and feces
3483510 i have cats and i know what cat feces smells like
3483511 kids who are abused and neglected often still love the person who is abusing them
3483512 they want to take it back and have things go back the way they were
3483513 he would have been lethargic and i would have thought it would have been quite apparent that he was sick
3483514 he had less than half a teaspoon of urine in his bladder
3483515 by the time he was one year old he hit the normal curve for the national growth chart
3483516 he was in the fifth to tenth percentile for weight and since he was shorter than average his weight was only a little bit lower than his height
3483517 in my opinion it seems very likely that he died of a combination of dehydration and starvation
3483518 you can destroy fingerprints by wiping them off of an item
3483519 it is something that will always stay in my memory the fact that he looked extremely malnourished i became very angry ive never seen anything like this
3483520 ive had many days of emotional distress because of this
3483521 he was so extremely malnourished he would not have been able to move around enough to sustain accidental injuries like these
3483522 that would happen over a period of time not just an hour or two
3483523 bruising of the ear is one of the first areas i look at if there is bruising of the ear it elevates my concern
3483524 i think its free so say i did not spend my time working on your case
3483525 there is a book you rely on called forensic pathology isnt there
3483526 they were as high as ive ever seen them in forensic toxicology
3483527 a cross section of rib showed that he had stopped growing at least five days if not weeks before he died
3483528 half of all 3 year olds weigh more than he did
3483529 he was small and thin throughout his whole life but he was basically a healthy boy and thriving
3483530 mommy and daddy put chandler in the closet because he was being really bad
3483531 sometimes he poops in his hand and rubs it all over the walls of the closet
3483532 i think he said his son had asthma or was having problems breathing
3483533 mostly he was a great father and he took care of them
3483534 he said that he was sick that they called 911 jon was trying to save him they took him the hospital and they werent able to save him
3483535 he was dark around the eyes that was the only difference
3483536 he showed me a bump and bruise on his forehead he pointed to his right ear i could see that it was bruised very purple
3483537 he hesitated for a second then he said he fell in the bathroom because it was slippery he said he hit the wall and thats how he got the bump on his head he looked sad he was looking down
3483538 i said who did it he was looking down he wasnt answering
3483539 didnt really want to talk to me he was looking down most of the time
3483540 very inquisitive he asked to touch my badge and things on my belt
3483541 somber but there were no gasps no physical reactions none were crying it didnt appear overwhelming
3483542 in your training and experience do abused parents still love their parents
3483543 very common for them to run up and hug their parents and to still want to please their abusive parent
3483544 he told me that nobody hit him that he fell in the bathtub and thats what he wanted me to know
3483545 are bad they have to take showers when they are good they are allowed to take baths
3483546 chandlers eyes lit up and he started to point to everything in the refrigerator he wanted everything on his plate he finally settled on two hot dogs pudding milk and a bag of chips
3483547 doctor did you fail to locate the bodys testicles during the autopsy
3483548 you dont have a horse in this race do you
3483549 in other words in the end you dont really care who wins thats not your issue your issue is the science
3483550 if the government calls you up youre happy to talk about it if i call you youre happy to talk to me that happened in this case
3483551 had you known the pancreas was an issue you would have kept the pancreas
3483552 would you agree that a misdiagnosed case of diabetes is the most common cause especially in young children
3483553 when you look at the pictures of chandlers sores there is only one that fits the classic form of bed sores
3483554 and when you wrote the report for chandler you never used the clinical or the common name for bed sores
3483555 from looking at the things you saw on chandler you cannot tell the jury that the sores came from confinement
3483556 you can say they are consistent with but not that they are caused by confinement
3483557 when you began your physical autopsy there are certain things you gathered to have a general background knowledge when you got the medical records one thing you noticed was that chandler was always small
3483558 what i found did not come from a refrigerator i wouldnt exactly call it food but brown secretions that were probably just gastric and intestinal
3483559 this is what you expect it to look like in a severe case
3483560 you can actually see the shoulder blades through the skin
3483561 the cause of death is dehydration and starvation due to restricting fluid and caloric intake
3483562 do you remember on what time of day you performed chandlers autopsy on may 7 2007
3483563 thats when i jumped down there and i yelled for sarah
3483564 i dont believe that he got sick and that caused him to die
3483565 dominick just called me and said chandler called him over and told him you and i better get him something to drink or hes gonna get out of there go to the kitchen and get a knife and kill us both
3483566 his ear is discolored and looks almost black on the inside of it
3483567 the smell here was almost overwhelming it was very powerful and the smell was coming from the floor
3483568 i got on my hands and knees and saw these brown marks chunks stains on the wall something was stuck to the wall it looked like poop feces
3483569 god says listen to mom and dad do not lie do not steal do not blame your brother for what you do be thankful for what you have
3483570 it smelled like urine smelled like feces and it smelled like cleaning products
3483571 god says listen to mom and dad do not steal do not lie
3483572 how do you feel you have done as a parent
3483573 they both eat they both play they both do everything
3483574 our doctors said in their expert opinion your son starved to death
3483575 thats something that occurs over a very long time period
3483576 they say hes skinny but thats the way he is thats the way i was
3483577 i dont understand how you can look at his photos from five months ago and say he doesnt look any different than he did when he died what would happen in five months that would make him look like hes in a concentration camp
3483578 where he has no cheeks his eyes are sunken in you can see the tendons in his legs he has sores all down his spine his shoulder blades are sticking out like icicles
3483579 if anyone looked at those pictures they wouldnt think this child is just thin they would think there was abuse neglect in five months he went from looking like a healthy child to a living skeleton
3483580 i dont understand how this could happen and someone not call for a doctor
3483581 he seemed to be doing fine he went back to watching the movie
3483582 i was sitting on the couch and it just didnt sound right
3483583 maybe he was a little bit skinnier but he always looks like that
3483584 been so healthy for the past year that he hasnt needed to see a pediatrician
3483585 he didnt have even a bit of emotion even after hearing chandler had died
3483586 neither of them wanted to say goodbye to their son
3483587 nothing could prepare me for that moment he was skin and bones you could see every bone in his face every rib in 14 years i have never seen anything like that he looked like a prisoner you see from a concentration camp but it was worse than that it was like nothing ive ever seen there was not one bit of muscle tissue in his body anywhere
3483588 his cheeks and eyes were sunken in he was dirty there was this smell you could see every rib his fingernails were blue he felt very very cold
3483589 i went in and i held his hand and i told him it was ok now
3483590 its not something that goes away ive thought about that little boy every day
3483591 chandler grafner did not die from starvation locked in a closet
3483592 chandler grafner had a secret killer that was diabetes it caused his body to feed on itself in a very rapid period of time even though he was eating and drinking
3483593 he and sarah berry squeezed the very life out of this child
3483594 they crammed him under the bottom shelf of a linen closet in a space no larger than an oven they denied him food and water and left him there to sleep in his own urine in his own feces on may 6 2007 after weeks of starvation and deprivation of water and being stuck in a dark hole chandler grafner died
3483595 chandler yelled to get out of the closet he begged for water and food
3483596 as for the rest of us we share in the responsibility of what happened to this child because our laws are too lax when it comes to the murder or molestation or rape of an innocent child
3483597 and then youll burn in hell hear no evil dont you see no evil dont you oh burn in hell lay no evil down on me youre gonna burn in hell speak no evil dont you think no evil dont you oh burn in hell play with evil cause im free
3483598 lawyer dies trying to rescue wife in river near aspen

3483603 am i a monster how could i we have done this
3483604 i dont care what he thinks feels may he burn in hell
3483605 maybe its time to bring back an updated version of what used to be called an orphanage not just for the short term until another mediocre foster home becomes available or until a drug addled parent stays sober a few weeks but a stable group home place where kids could get comfortable get to be known by the staff and grow up with some other kids and maybe develop some life long relationships
3483606 defend ed the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic
3483607 the young boy contradicted other witnesses by saying he and chandler ate tacos the night before chandler died while his parents ate oatmeal other witnesses including their grandparents testified earlier in the day that chandler often was forced to eat oatmeal as punishment at a family easter dinner chandler ate oatmeal as punishment while the rest of the family including an aunt uncle and cousins ate roast pork
3483608 dominic will testify chandler had food to eat the night before he died
3483609 murder is defined by degree and categorized under different classifications murder falls under the jurisdiction of state laws and laws vary from state to state
3483610 after the exercise of reflection and judgment concerning the act
3483611 this is most common in untreated type 1 diabetes mellitus when the liver breaks down fat and proteins in response to a perceived need for respiratory substrate it can also occur with people undergoing hunger strikes fasting over 3 days or people starving to death as the body is forced to break down fat for sustenance due to their lack of outside nutrition

3483615 dont have sex with someone you may not want to be tied to for the rest of your life if she has a child condoms are not fool proof
3483616 the main factor in our decision was whether we wanted to make dominic participate in a prosecution where his father could be put to death
3483617 gee well yes we locked him in a closet didnt feed him or let him go to the bathroom but its not our fault he died holy mother of god this is a sick and pathetic display
3483618 the main factor in our decision was whether we wanted to make dominic participate in a prosecution where his father could be put to death
3483619 he dr factor said chandlers organs did not show evidence of starvation caused by being deprived food
3483620 not a single comment poster is more qualified than dr factor
3483621 he dr factor said chandlers organs did not show evidence of starvation caused by being deprived food
3483622 on behalf of the lieutenant governor thank you for voicing your opinion and making us aware of your concern with colorados child welfare system the lieutenant governor takes seriously input from her constituents and she will be informed of your concern

3483625 the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons
3483626 there was no evidence of diabetes in his kidneys and his pancreas was producing insulin normally
3483627 the jury can only consider the evidence as it pertains to the specific charges
3483628 confirmed his belief that chandler had diabetes as a cause of his wasting and dehydration
3483629 he asked the jury to find phillips guilty on all three charges
3483630 keeps him from eating drinking and beats him for asking

3483685 t he admissibility of other crimes evidence depends on 1 the materiality of the facts sought to be proved 2 the tendency of the page 8 uncharged crimes to prove those facts and 3 the existence of any rule or policy requiring exclusion of the evidence i e cal evid code 352
3483686 t he prosecutions burder to prove every element of the crime is not relieved by a defendants tactical decisions not to contest an essential element of the offense
3483687 the least degree of similarity between the uncharged at and the charged offense
3483688 the recurrence of a similar result tends increasingly with each instance to negative accident or inadvertence or self defense or good faith or other innocent mental state and tends to establish provisionally at least though not certainly the presence of the normal i e criminal intent accompanying such n act
3483689 the instinctive recognition of that logical process page 9 which eliminates the element of innocent intent by multiplying instances of the same result until it is perceived that this element cannot explain them all
3483690 lived in four different geographically distant neighborhoods arson fires regularly occurred either at her home or within easy walking distance of it the fires were set during her residency and stopped when she moved
3483691 t he doctrine of chances tells us it is extremely unlikely that through bad luck or coincidence an innocent person would live so near so many arson fires occurring so frequently in so many different neighborhoods
3483692 continually lied to and manipulated women including in particular women who like the victim he befriended at the fitness center as a specific example of the pattern he continually led them to believe he came from a wealthy family he did so consistently to obtain their property the evidence shows he could be very charming and at first convincing he also continually lured women to his home where he robbed and raped them
3483693 i t would have been a remarkable coincidence if shortly after the defendant violently assaulted two women he befriended at the fitness center some different person happened to use that same apartment to assault another woman defendant had befriended at the fitness center
3483694 such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations
3483695 highly probative in establishing the defendants use of a common scheme and plan with both victims
3483696 manifested in his foyer with lana clarkson decided to leave and he perceived a challenge to his control this pattern of behavior falls squarely within the purview of 1101 b and the supporting case law and should be admissible as such
3483697 the uncharged misconduct and the charged offense must share common features that are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference that the same person committed both acts
3483698 the prosecutions burden to prove every element of the crime is not relieved by a defendants tactical decision not to contest an essential element of the offense
3483699 to be relevant on the issue of identity the uncharged crimes must be highly similar to the charged offense
3483700 distinctive combination of circumstances between the page 13 prior robbery and the charged robbery shows without resort to disposition that the perpetrators were the same persons and that they acted with the same intent
3483701 evidence of other crimes that meets the similarity requirement for evidence of a common design or plan is also admissible under evidence code section 1101 to corroborate the complaining witness
3483702 i f a person claims the defendant committed rape and the defendant denies it the complaining witness might be lying if however two people claim rape and if their stories are sufficiently similar the chance that both are lying or that one is truthful and the other invented a false story that just happens to be similar is greatly diminished the jury can reasonably and quite properly infer that it is more likely both are truthful
3483703 as the prosecutions own evidence and argument made clear the various uncharged incidents at most a half dozen occurring over a thirty year period if they occurred at all
3483704 t he more similar and the more independent the two accounts are the greater the strength of the corroboration
3483705 evidence of uncharged crimes is inherently prejudicial but may still be admitted if it has substantial probative effect the matter lies within the discretion of the trial court
3483706 its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will create substantial danger of undue prejudice
3483707 the probative value of such evidence would increase further if independent evidence of additional instances of similar misconduct were produced
3483708 the leeward marks today were a full on pileup in the current boats would stop right at the mark and it would make it easy for boats to catch up and create overlaps if this were a normal regatta id be mad at myself but this feels more like a learning experience all i can to is to be positive and try to improve

3483714 if you want to come root for another team thats ok but we dont want somebody pouring a beer over your head
3483715 the awareness and urgency of energy issues is beyond where it has been before
3483716 youre seeing energy prices and climate change overlap and point toward a clean energy future
3483717 on both sides there are a lot of opportunities they could seize
3483718 what we want most of all is to make sure opportunities arent overlooked
3483719 instead of having a steady upward growth you have growth during a year then a decline
3483720 this is by far the most important federal policy that the solar industry could have right now
3483721 the problem with relying on tax credits is that not everybody can use them
3483722 many small companies arent going to run profits and have to team up with somebody else
3483723 there are only a limited number of sites where geothermal energy is available
3483724 you cant expand it indefinitely cant make it anywhere whereas wind and solar you can make with current technology but is more expensive than fossil fuel based electricity
3483725 theres a lot of rhetoric around renewables but on again off again stuff doesnt really help us
3483726 were not driving the game were trying to stay in it
3483727 designed with an eye to make the most out of wind power
3483728 i think and i hope that we dont have too long to wait before we get good climate change legislation
3483729 but i dont think it will happen until we have the new administration
3483730 there are folks out in coastal communities that are absolutely mortified by the prospect of losing acadia national park the jersey shore the outer banks the gulf coast of florida and the entire california coast
3483731 that helps to explain why congress has been stuck between floors on this issue in the last month or so and will no doubt continue to be unable to open the coasts
3483732 i dont have casinos i dont have big hotels we dont have cruise ships coming in its our dance with mother nature that truly makes us one of americas last great frontiers
3483733 on the other hand im in charge of tourism and i have to make sure people are getting on planes getting on trains and getting in cars thats critically important because thats how we feed people here
3483734 north carolinians didnt elect sen dole to be stubborn and intransigent and she doesnt take positions and make policies in a vacuum sen dole takes into consideration the facts and the concerns of those she represents and facts and constituents opinions can evolve
3483735 for several years now sen dole has heard from various coastal community leaders who were interested in the state having this option to explore offshore because of the jobs and revenues this could mean for their communities
3483736 many individuals who are candidates or incumbents in congress started in the state legislature and have had an opportunity to visit these operations offshore theyve seen that theyre safe dont pollute and are good for the states economy and good for the national economy
3483737 the oil and gas industry is being heard however more importantly americas consumers are being heard
3483738 the u s economy and the growing energy challenge are two of the top issues on the minds of voters for the upcoming elections and issues that are not going to go away in the near future the longer policymakers wait to do something about this crisis the worse off the countrys energy future will be
3483739 tourism is largely driven by perception and the perception of our area as a desirable vacation spot depends on the sugar white beaches and emerald green water and offshore drilling has the potential to destroy that both the perception and the reality
3483740 a catastrophic spill could shut down our beaches for several seasons damage our estuaries decimate our commercial and recreational fishing industry and devastate our economy
3483741 the constituents in south carolina are very interested in this plan because it can be done safely and effectively to help on the supply side without tarnishing the states tourism
3483742 its not like youre sitting off the coast of myrtle beach charleston and hilton head and looking at an oil rig
3483743 ive sat in a room with the big oil guys in the back its scary
3483744 theyve got a lot of money itll probably come down to whos got the best oiled campaign money and politics goes hand in hand
3483745 theres no one particular industry that benefits from offshore drilling it benefits everyone the working class will benefit the most and are feeling the impact the most rarely are those the same people who make campaign contributions
3483746 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3483747 hospitals and doctors to adopt a statewide electronic records keeping system by 2015
3483748 mandates hospitals report all hospital acquired infections and bans them from charging for so called never events like wrong side surgeries
3483749 the most hostile state in the nation when it comes to biopharmaceutical sales
3483750 they have policies and procedures in place to foster compliance with the code
3483751 transparency brings about accountability and benefits everyone consumers most of all
3483752 if the bible is the word of god why is there so much hate bigotry and misogyny in the
3483753 but now we must free ourselves from foreign oil and we know we can through an aggressive energy plan that provides for environmentally responsible offshore drilling and investments in new technologies and alternative energies we can free ourselves but the democrat lead congress is standing in our way
3483754 i think the ship has sailed on us believing that roscoe bartlett has an energy policy
3483755 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections
3483756 the presence of the divine ark christ will constitute the life of this church
3483757 the birth of this virgin church was typified by st
3483758 there is not at this day 1679 visible upon the earth such a church all profession being found light when weighed in the balances
3483759 wherefore the spirit of david shall revive in this church and most especially in some elect members of it as the blossoming root
3483760 egypt doth figure this servile creation under which abrahams seed groans but a prophet and the most prophetical generation will the most high raise up who shall deliver his people by the force of spiritual arms for which there must be raised up certain head powers to bear the first office who are to be persons in favor with god whose dread and fear shall fall on all nations visible and invisible because of the mighty acting power of the holy spirit which shall rest upon them
3483761 thus moses joshua and aaron may be considered types of some upon whom the same spirit will come yet in greater proportion
3483762 there will be some who will be fully redeemed being clothed upon with a priestly garment after the melchisedek order
3483763 upon this body will be the fixation of the urim and thummim that are the portion of the melchisedek priesthood whose descent is not counted in the genealogy of that creation which is under the fall but in another genealogy which is a new creation
3483764 none but those who have so ascended and received his glory can condescend and communicate the same being thereby his representatives upon the earth and subordinate priests under him now
3483765 therefore there should be a holy emulation and ambition stirred up among the bands of believers that they may be of the first fruits unto him that is risen from the dead and so be made principal agents for him and with him that they may be if possible of the number of the first born of the new jerusalem mother all true waiters of his kingdom in spirit under whatsoever profession they may be ought to be numbered among the virgin spirits to whom this message appertains be watchful and quicken your pace

3483785 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3483786 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3483787 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3483788 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3483789 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3483790 best of luck with the new venture i feel there is a huge amount of educating required in this area as wikis in my opinion are still not being given the recognition and investment they deserve
3483791 great to hear it stewart i enjoy your blog and your guest spots on wikinomics can you steer me to some public communities that focus on wikis and enterprise 2 0 issues so that i can supplement my blog reading i enjoy reading independent thinkers but id really like to see some rapid fire
3483792 great i wish you a lot fun with your new venture tim
3483793 i know that i said on my first day that i did not count on him but i also said that i would treat him like any other player
3483794 his behaviour and attitude in scotland and the united states have made me decide that he will remain with us and as well as that he is a player with immense talent
3483795 the negotiations to sign a number nine were stopped some weeks ago following a decision by me and txiki begiristain sporting director
3483796 before bringing players in you must let players go and as everything was going well i decided that it was not necessary to sign anybody and everything would remain the same
3483797 it all stems from the administrations decision to endorse torture
3483798 once the decision was made to use torture the administration needed a system of rules that would allow them to rely on evidence obtained from torture thus these military commissions
3483799 the most absurd thing is that if by some miracle hamdan had been found guilty on all counts acquittal wouldnt have meant liberty hed have just been moved to a different cell the trial was essentially meaningless because the administration takes the position that it has the right to hold enemy combatants until the end of the war on terror whether or not they have been convicted of crimes
3483800 the instructions came from eckstein you never received those instructions from garth or myron
3483801 you had no first hand knowledge whether mr eckstein had in fact met with the boys or whether the adjustments were raised with them
3483802 the concours is the most comfortable sport touring bike youll ever ride
3483803 donya carlson rider magazine likes it shes got legs up to here
3483804 youre tall enough too im waaay too short for that bike youll love it really
3483805 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
3483806 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him your sentence should say the united states will hunt you down and give you a harsh but appropriate sentence if you provide material support for terrorism
3483807 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
3483808 godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes that you are able to return to your wife and daughters and your country
3483809 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
3483810 to hold a man who has been judged to be of minimal risk to the country would make a mockery of the legal proceedings just completed
3483811 weve just initiated a process to go out and respond to people who have proactively approached us over the last couple years as theyve became familiar with this opportunity
3483812 now that weve finalized the engineering study weve decided to go out to them and solicit proposals
3483813 so we would own a smaller share of a larger facility which we think would be a much better value opportunity for shareholders
3483814 power and stability are the keys to getting to the finish line
3483815 i was proud to see our 313 skid steer go toe to toe in strength but the overall balance of our machine over uneven ground was the key to victory here
3483816 although our sales continue to be strong we are concerned about a general slowdown in the economy
3483817 when it comes to pdas or similar technology its inconsiderate people that cause the problems not the technology
3483818 the solution is education blackberries like cell phones are still relatively new and people need to be educated to become more courteous users the same courtesy applies to the use of all technology be respectful and considerate of others and other peoples time if someone does something that annoys you dont do it yourself
3483819 youre not giving anyone your undivided attention if you are continually sneaking glances at your messages just in case someone more important is sending a message
3483820 think of a similar situation the work networking event you are standing and talking to one of your associates and they are looking away keeping an eye on the door this wouldnt be acceptable either
3483821 conversations on your blackberry or cell phone are better carried on in private places where you dont disturb others and wont be overheard
3483822 even though you arent speaking when you are e mailing on your blackberry you shouldnt be texting someone while you are carrying on a face to face conversation with someone else you may call it multi tasking but most people call it just plain rude the person you are with takes precedence over calling e mailing surfing or checking messages on your blackberry
3483823 jo is going to the olympics and wont get a full pre season that will mean hes not at his best until january
3483824 carlos and javier found it difficult when they first went to west ham and missed out on pre season
3483825 but we saw the best of tevez at the end of that season when he was magnificent
3483826 with a lot of hebrew schools today you have to be affiliated with a synagogue
3483827 but this is for anybody to feed children knowledge they dont get at home and school we want to bring the south african style which is very community based to san francisco
3483828 he comes to the bay area after a career in the kosher food industry
3483829 im sure you know that he is rabbi pils son in law we didnt want to get into all that i had length conversation with rabbi langer about this i decided to handle it straight and to keep it short
3483830 they plugged in the electric iron and then burnt me punched me and slapped me with the side of a panga in front of my wife three children and domestic worker
3483831 they were speaking xitsonga mixed with english i gave them r1 000 cash but they said it was not enough
3483832 it is up to you we will chop him to death in front you if resist giving us the bakkie keys now

3483835 rape by a person in a position of public authority
3483836 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3483837 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3483838 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress
3483839 we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3483840 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a cease fire
3483841 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3483842 to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict
3483843 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and well continue our discussions with all of the parties involved

3484307 intelligent input darling why dont you have another beer then
3484308 i went to him and asked him if there was any part of iowa that was active in filmmaking and he highly recommended that we go to davenport
3484309 we are still scouting throughout the quad cities and the countryside beyond obviously since its children of the corn
3484310 they put a lot of sugar if you will into the coffee
3484311 we wanted to stay faithful to the decisions in his original story
3484312 i have a lot of interest of people wanting to be in it
3484313 its always great because it brings several millions of dollars into the quad city economy in terms of hotels foods and restaurants
3484314 it gives the quad cities exposure on a national sometimes international stage all in all its a good deal whenever we have movies come to the quad cities
3484315 what if he likes me more than i like him
3484316 what if i like him more than he likes me
3484317 my kids used to use it every day to go to school
3484318 people stroll up and down there a lot we like that
3484319 this is something thats so simple but its turned into such an ugly dispute
3484320 its a private easement not a public easement the construction of the metal barriers were a violation of the city building code we intervened because they refused to remove them
3484321 theyve put wooden barriers there which dont need a permit
3484322 they are barring access for other property owners but thats a civil matter
3484323 i dont want to go on the road with them so im stuck to me
3484324 we dont want to fight we dont want money we just want to use the trail
3484325 its no different than anyone else fencing in their yards weve never denied our neighbors access to our trail all weve ever asked is that they show some concern and close the gates behind them
3484326 comcast corp and metro goldwyn mayer inc said tuesday they are teaming up to introduce a video on demand channel featuring action movies and tv shows

3484331 cuz there was a pool going on around here that you were laid up someplace dying in your own shit
3484332 mobile business users are starting to rely on smartphones to synchronize with the enterprise
3484333 i know i havent heard of any incidents i went to three schools yesterday and everything seems to be moving a long
3484334 because if our kids are not safe we cannot educate them and thats the main point of the work we do
3484335 if every time we propose something is all we get the push back of what could happen we need these kids to know everyone in this community expects them to be in school
3484336 im coming to you as an optimistic fellow ive seen what happens when america deals with difficulty i believe that were a resilient economy and i believe that the ingenuity and resolve of the american people is what helps us deal with these issues and its going to happen again
3484337 i think we made the right decision i think the federal reserve made the right decision here and again i dont know what to say other than what ive just said is weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country
3484338 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3484339 by the way do you have a youtube channel called your world politics
3484340 generally breeding of these animals is especially difficult in captivity
3484341 but with 23 clouded leopards howletts wild animal park is one of the very few zoos to have been successful in its breeding programme with no less than 30 births since 2003
3484342 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3484343 each compiler should get points for causing the listeners to buy discs
3484344 its hard to find a place to exchange we have to go downtown to the central station or post office
3484345 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
3484346 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget
3484347 he has very little debt i just love it anybody who wants to make him out as this wide eyed liberal i just dont see any evidence for that not in the way he runs his campaign and this tells you a lot about how he can administer things how he manages things how he deals with situations
3484348 this race is very similar to the 1952 campaign that brought my grandfather to power
3484349 he was an outsider who was nominated by the republican party but it was not an easy process at all he was an outsider who threatened to shake up the party itself
3484350 i served with sen mccain and he and i were the only two to vote against the bush cheney tax cuts
3484351 during this campaign it is a different john mccain he is saying he would make the tax cuts permanent he is advocating more drilling whereas he voted against drilling in anwr it goes to his credibility and that is such an important issue for this country plus his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
3484352 we can do this in order to clear you and to assure us that this man didnt give you any money if you give me your money we can check it against a database at our police station here in zona rosa

3484360 how to be green many people have asked us this important question its really very simple and requires no expert knowledge or complex skills heres the answer consume less share more enjoy life
3484361 it is only a minor simplification to suggest that those activists drawn from the peace movement saw ef uk as a means of promoting mass nvda non violent direct action of a largely symbolic form while those from an animal liberation background regarded ef as a vehicle for more militant tactics
3484362 certain types of damage to property like pouring sugar into a bulldozer which is going through a sssi i dont have a problem with that
3484363 you cant come into an event like that hitting a bbc cameraman just because he was filming what was going on
3484364 a greater capacity for collective action greater tenacity greater satisfaction from movement participation
3484365 higher degrees of membership coercion narrowing the number and range of people who will participate
3484366 the turmoil within the green party is simply one symptom of a wider crisis other signs include the haemorrage from foe of local members who are frustrated by the restrictions placed on them by the leadership and are attracted by the more confrontational direct approach of anarchist influenced groups

3484372 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment

3484400 over the full life cycle from mining of the uranium iron ore and other minerals manufacture of the components and construction of the power station operation and maintenance of the power station through to decommissioning of the station and the management and disposal of waste nuclear power emits less than 11 grams of carbon equivalent per kilowatt hour
3484401 this is the same order of magnitude as wind and solar power including construction and component manufacturing and two orders of magnitude below i e one hundredth of the average for coal oil and natural gas
3484402 nuclear power thus has the potential to make a substantial contribution to sustainable development and a significant contribution to reducing south africas greenhouse gas emissions
3484403 due to south africas rich resources of uranium it makes sense for eskom to utilise this energy source
3484404 renewable forms of energy are also under investigation and are likely to be constructed
3484405 at present however the identified renewable forms of energy for example wind and solar are inadequately developed to provide large scale power generation facilities that can supply a reliable base load and easily integrate into the existing power network in south africa

3484432 el presidente morales me dijo que le permiti ramos jugar ahora en su capital pero que construir a un estadio nuevo
3484433 quiero pedir al presidente de la fifa que corrija sus declaraciones pero fundamentalmente que se sume a defender esta universalidad del deporte los vetos que intentaron hacer con bolivia no coinciden con las mismos estatutos que tiene fifa
3484434 forma parte de mi trabajo tomar decisiones y ahora decido que etoo siga con nosotros

3484441 como consecuencia de la persistencia en la lesi n de isquiotibiales que viene padeciendo baggio desde la pasada temporada club y jugador han llegado a un acuerdo para rescindir el contrato que vinculaba a ambas partes
3484442 todo a quien conozco en inglaterra cree que el arsenal va a ganar
3484443 el arsenal siempre quiere jugar en liga de campeones y creo que tiene la necesidad de hacerlo porque dispone de buenos jugadores y de un gran estadio
3484444 entrar en el partido relajado con la creencia de que podemos ganar pero tambi n disfrutar de ello porque enfrente tenemos al arsenal es un acontecimiento porque es la primera vez en la historia que el club juega liga de campeones
3484445 no puedo seguir teniendo una inversi n tan grande como la que ha hecho por miguel caneo su sueldo su costo de jugador por el que pagamos cerca del mill n de d lares y resulta que no nos ha salido patrocinio y es una verdadera tristeza esta situaci n para el campe n de colombia
3484446 todo el mundo tiene las mejores intenciones pero el f tbol avanza todos los d as salen m s costos as que es factible que esta semana se pueda cerrar un negocio con el f tbol argentino para que miguel se vaya es una tristeza
3484447 pusimos todas las ganas trabajamos muy fuerte pero no se dieron los resultados que quer amos
3484448 ellos los jugadores dieron absolutamente todo de s durante este tiempo eso les agradec de coraz n
3484449 nos trae suerte pero no puedo decir detalles para no quitar la magia
3484450 de vez en cuando hace falta aportar una brizna de diferencia y de frescura con alguien que ha tenido una vida de jugador principalmente en el extranjero
3484451 mejora del nivel de confort de trabajo para unos y otros
3484452 aunque el resultado puede que marque mucha diferencia el partido estuvo disputado hasta el final
3484453 cuando uno va jugando m s y va ganando se va sintiendo m s c modo y hoy creo que no comet errores tontos y eso fue muy bueno para el resultado final
3484454 la ltima vez que jugu con rochus fue en la final de auckland hace tiempo es un jugador que hay que respetar tiene mucha mano gan dos partidos muy buenos y por algo esta en tercera ronda
3484455 partido perfecto jug de manera muy inteligente cometi muy pocos errores no forzados y sac muchos primeros servicios a tres cuartos de velocidad
3484456 pens mucho entre punto y punto que es lo importante creo si fernando sigue as nos puede dar grandes alegr as
3484457 plasmar en el campo todo lo que hemos ensayado en la pretemporada
3484458 ya no lo recuerdo bien pero es una sensaci n de agitaci n como jugador intervienes en el partido pero como entrenador poco puedes hacer
3484459 me preocupa la sensaci n de que por ser poco conocido se le valore menos he visto v deos y s que tenemos por delante una eliminatoria muy dura
3484460 tendremos que jugar a muy buen nivel para sacar un buen resultado
3484461 parents placing more importance on personal and marital happiness and seeing parenthood as less fulfilling
3484462 el era un muchacho fornido para estar tan peque o
3484463 pero su disciplina y preparaci n lo llevaron a ganar merecidamente la medalla en pek n
3484464 tenemos muy claro lo que nos jugamos y lo que pretendemos
3484465 no tenemos presi n presi n es no estar en europa porque un grande como el atl tico necesita estar todos los a os en europa sta es una final todos sabemos que tenemos que devolver a este equipo al lugar que se merece tenemos la firme convicci n de que tiene que estar donde se merece
3484466 por eso estar aqu es una alegr a m s que presi n aunque los jugadores est n ansiosos porque venga el partido tenemos muy claro lo que nos jugamos y lo que pretendemos en lugar de jugar amistosos de pretemporada nos jugamos la vida el a o pasado lo hicimos en ruman a y ste en alemania
3484467 habida cuenta del rival que tambi n puede obtener un buen resultado en la vuelta tenemos que hacer algo m s que defender un marcador aqu podemos encarrilar la eliminatoria y matarla en casa no podemos pensar en que podremos defendernos durante 90 minutos
3484468 el kun es muy importante pero como simao maxi forl n o leo gracias al esfuerzo de todos estamos aqu sab amos que no le bamos a tener a ag ero y el equipo fich bien sinama se ha adaptado rapid simo al esquema y al ambiente del vestuario y en ese sentido la pretemporada fue buena el equipo est preparado siempre he dicho que no dependemos de nadie
3484469 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3484470 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3484471 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3484472 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3484473 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3484474 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5

3484478 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3484479 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3484480 en estos partidos lo nico peligroso es que nosotros no hagamos las cosas bien porque los partidos son f ciles o dif ciles en funci n de c mo lo hagamos nosotros
3484481 cambiar ser a un error porque esa manera de jugar es el camino a seguir
3484482 sabemos que cuando un jugador sube otro tiene que bajar y viceversa y lo estamos haciendo bien hasta el momento
3484483 atacamos como un equipo y defendemos como un equipo si seguimos con este equilibrio seremos un equipo muy dif cil de batir ojal no cambiemos nunca
3484484 con un ochenta o noventa por ciento a nuestro favor
3484485 nos gusta competir y conseguir objetivos y eso pasa por superar este tipo de partidos parece f cil pero se te puede complicar
3484486 tanto para estudiar a los rivales como para ver nuestros errores
3484487 imponer nuestro ritmo de juego y nuestra forma de jugar
3484488 tan s lo en ver c mo es su forma de jugar para poder contrarrestarla y dejar la eliminatoria bien encaminada
3484489 hemos llegado a una situaci n que tenemos que corregir
3484490 queremos la pasi n y las rivalidades lo que no queremos es la falta de respeto y los abusos
3484491 me preocupo de que sea el primer expulsado como lo fui el a o pasado por una decisi n m s bien inofensiva pero creo que la idea es estupenda para controlar los excesos
3484492 a veces y recuerdo la temporada anterior se producen incidentes en que se pasan de la raya y la conducta de jugador y t cnico se tornan inaceptables
3484493 los rbitros tambi n tienen su responsabilidad al establecer mejores relaciones con los capitanes de los equipos y con los dem s jugadores y comunic ndose como corresponde ayudar n a los jugadores y eso a su vez har mejor el f tbol para todos
3484494 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3484495 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3484496 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3484497 als resultat verschiedener externer effekte die celesio beeinflussen sind wir der meinung dass das derzeitige gesch ftsmodell mehr abw rts als aufw rtspotenzial liefert
3484498 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3484499 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3484500 strategies to advance the process of entry by troops cannot ignore children and junior youth if the victories won in one generation are not to be lost with the passage of time it is imperative then that at this point in the process of systematization of the teaching work definite steps be taken to ensure that the vision of the community fully embraces its young members
3484501 we geloven dat deze problemen typerend zijn voor een onvolwassen chipset en radio protocolstack waarbij we bijna zeker zijn dat infineon de leverancier van de 3g chip is

3484505 homeland security is not just a homeland security or military concern we need to prepare a condition of anticipation
3484506 yes ive been through all that but who am i now thats where my truth is and all of what ive experienced has brought me here
3484507 yes i remember that i remember when i got this
3484508 when i dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether or not i am afraid
3484509 when i dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether or not i am afraid
3484510 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3484511 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3484512 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3484513 not as bad a place to be as you remember

3484524 youre just left with yourself all the time whatever you do anyway youve got to get down to your own god in your own temple its all down to you mate
3484525 we did give them a license yes but only to carry out mapping activities in northern kenya i am not aware of any other secret activities they are involved in
3484526 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3484527 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3484528 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3484529 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3484530 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3484531 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3484532 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3484533 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community
3484534 im very grateful i survived this i didnt think i would
3484535 i wish that i had followed it with all my heart
3484536 thought that they had not finished the investigation they hadnt considered all the evidence
3484537 that secret church documents about these pedophile priests will be made public
3484538 these courageous victims are the ones who deserve praise today
3484539 no single check magically erases years of cover up and insensitivity and recklessness and deceit of public relations posturing by church officials
3484540 nor does a check magically restore the shattered trust stolen childhoods and devastated psyches of dozens of victims of predatory priests and complicit bishops
3484541 thats okay but well probably not be able to ask you back we dont want people to sue the mayor
3484542 well just put your name on the bottom of the prayer person list from now on
3484543 thank you for the honor of being able to give the invocation at this council meeting i understand that i am not allowed to pray in the name of jesus i will honor that request but want to let everyone know that i will be praying to my lord and savior jesus christ who saved me from hell by dying for my sins on a cross i dont want anyone to be confused on whose god im praying to
3484544 and i pray this in the name that is above all names the king of kings and lord of lords amen
3484545 i need my living room to look like that with touches of red and black
3484546 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3484547 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him not understanding it
3484548 this is a disgraceful and unsubstantiated witch hunt and shows how few ethics gene ethics really have
3484549 maybe i was shooting up while you were working at safeway pregnant with my child
3484550 most of them dont know about these things basically were encouraging them to step over the line
3484551 to increase their mobility their flexibility to get out and try new things
3484552 complementary medicine is going mainstream quickly part of the impulse is therapeutic part of it is economic
3484553 those with low vitamin d on top of just being at higher risk for heart attack in general were at particularly high risk to have a fatal heart attack
3484554 traditionally physicians have only been concerned about the bone effects but perhaps having these chronically low levels of vitamin d may be having these subtle physiological changes in a lot of tissues
3484555 basically what i do is play golf take off the socks roll em up put them in my shoes and ive been doing it for two and half years now
3484556 im not trying to encourage unhygienic habits i do it simply because i want to see how far we can go
3484557 some copper compounds are anti bacterial but that does not mean copper containing compounds put in socks will necessarily be good
3484558 very often claims of copper especially in arthritis have been shown to be pure quackery
3484559 the interest in antimicrobials especially antiviral coating is very very high
3484560 whoever gets it right will have a very nice business
3484561 all i can report are anecdotal studies from my office
3484562 but i think its a very exciting technology for the future
3484563 cupron has interesting ideas and the world is hungry for new ideas that work
3484564 but relatively few survive the rigor of first rate medical investigation
3484565 an estimated one quarter of all cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented with 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity alone
3484566 carbohydrate intolerance higher insulin levels and insulin insensitivity in fat and muscle tissue
3484567 weight loss alone can correct all of these abnormalities and either significantly improves diabetes or totally resolves it
3484568 both on the part of the physician and the patient
3484569 mrs coretta scott king was in mexico for observation and consideration of treatment for ovarian cancer
3484570 she was considered terminal by physicians in the united states mrs king and her family wanted to explore other options
3484571 a very eclectic approach to the treatment of chronic degenerative disease diseases by and large considered incurable by the orthodox medical profession
3484572 who have been told that there is no hope all traditional therapies have failed
3484573 as with men womens most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort but women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms particularly shortness of breath nausea vomiting and back or jaw pain

3484621 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3484628 i dont see any way that the nuggets can possibly win because he was a key guy for them
3484629 without camby i dont see any way that they can possibly win because he was a key guy for them
3484630 believe me i watched at least 70 games they played maybe more and he was a key guy
3484631 im sure it didnt make any sense to anybody from a basketball point of view
3484632 from a financial viewpoint i guess stock is down a little bit or something must be down a couple hundred million dollars i dont know i didnt know money was a problem in that family
3484633 i dont know how you can let marcus camby go
3484634 he was like the heart and soul of that team when it comes to defense protecting the basket and rebounding its tough to replace him
3484635 my belief is its about players and about teammates and who youve got on your team
3484636 you cant do it alone in the nba i dont think hes had enough with him to enable him to get his team to the finals
3484637 obviously the west is much more difficult top to bottom than the east dwyane had shaq lebron had a great run and lebrons a great player
3484638 but carmelo won a national championship so he can win dwyane wade didnt win a national championship in college so carmelos already proven he can win i believe he can win in the nba
3484639 i think allen is a tremendous offensive player but hes not a point guard that gets other people involved hes a guy that scores i think they just dont have enough to win
3484640 theyre a great offensive team but in the nba in the west particularly youve got to stop people
3484641 there are great teams out there its hard to outscore those teams they have not been a great defensive team
3484642 they just have never seemed to be able to play consistently at a high level not necessarily defensively just overall i dont know enough about them to know all the reasons for that

3484660 i know that i said on my first day that i did not count on him but i also said that i would treat him like any other player

3484662 the negotiations to sign a number nine were stopped some weeks ago following a decision by me and txiki begiristain sporting director

3484680 to give youth a future it is important that education be understood as a search for the integral and harmonious development of the person as the maturation of the moral conscience to discern good and act accordingly and as attention to the spiritual dimension of young people as they develop
3484681 true education must start from the truth about man the affirmation of his dignity and transcendent vocation looking at every young person in this anthropological perspective means seeking to help him develop the best of himself so that in exercising all his skills he may carry out whatever god calls him to do
3484682 i urge you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god your spiritual worship do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good and pleasing so you my child be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and what you heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach others as well

3484949 that was such a delightful piece i believe im going to play it again
3484950 its lobster and bacon thats practically cheating for a high end restaurant
3484951 great service and never too crowded this place is a find
3484952 no im fine i dont want another glass of wine
3484953 a stellar place where bike guys can and will speak to anyone about anything to do about bikes
3484954 we sorry its our fault but its not a big deal its just a piece of cake
3484955 thats another reason i love new york just like impress the guests
3484956 i think eight mile creek is the ghetto name of the detroits reservoir
3484957 i think weve done a pretty good job malia and sasha are very down on britney spears and paris hilton malia is the first one to change the channel if something suddenly comes on that she thinks is inappropriate
3484958 and when miley cyrus had that picture in vanity fair holding a sheet to her chest she just offered this very sensible opinion
3484959 well she seems like a good person her family seems to love her everybody makes mistakes so i hope that people wont judge her for just this one picture

3484963 and accounted for 52 of the photo merchandise market value last year by the end of 2008 were going to see this figure reach 57 looking further ahead nearly 30m photobooks will be sold in in 2012
3484964 online is still the channel of choice for most consumers in this market
3484965 accounting for nearly 90 of orders across it makes sense that people are more inclined to create and order photobooks in the comfort of their homes due to the amount of time involved in the creation process and from a retailers perspective theres little appeal in consumers tying up in store kiosks for relatively long periods of time though there are a number of time efficient solutions coming to market calendars and single image gifts require far less creation time and are therefore better suited to the retail environment
3484966 overall the photo merchandise market will be fuelled by falling prices and a growing availability of services at retail which will also drive cannibalisation of the 6 4
3484967 the summer of spam has caught up with us this time
3484968 we are now in the situation where spam accounts for almost 90 percent of all e mail and increasingly contains links to infected sites
3484969 companies really need to employ a combination of e mail security gateways that have anti spam protection using multiple techniques to block malicious content and secure web gateway products that do not just rely on url filtering but also scan the content that end users are downloading and uploading in real time
3484970 with the growing popularity of digital video and the hd format consumers continue to look for ways to extend recording times and maintain fast data transfer rates dtr to maximize the performance of their recording device

3484986 people who need to read this book are scared to read it the subject matter is difficult
3484987 i mean who wants to read a book about breast cancer
3484988 have tried five times i have no apparent fertility problems all doctors say you have a great supply of follicles they say nothing but positive things it should work this way
3484989 i dont have the fun of having sex personally life is never simple
3484990 i dropped some friends who disappointed me i was pretty ruthless
3484991 but i couldnt write the real dark side because i didnt want to hurt anyone it has to be surface
3484992 i keep telling everyone in my life do not even think about writing a memoir until everyone is dead its impossible to write about things without hurting people everything i wrote was true but it was a version of the truth
3484993 the person i was able to write most honestly about was my mother had she been alive i would never have been able to write such things about her
3484994 everyone was okay because i wrote such a loving portrait
3484995 i wrote down every single thing my mother said bearing witness to it all was my way of coping
3484996 when i put my writer hat on i asked myself whats the most evocative scene
3484997 i just had to pick and choose every sentence was verbatim writing the book was my mourning period because i was just in shock for a year or two
3484998 the manuscript is pretty much intact as i wrote it
3484999 my editor took out one section about a boyfriend that was it
3485000 the doctors i wrote about that i liked i kept their real names
3485001 the book was published exactly as i wrote it of course the language was cleaned up but my editor just trusted me and allowed it to be
3485002 there is a lot of stuff that i couldnt write
3485003 it would probably be a more glamorous job if we were hanging out with the actors
3485004 every other writer went to recharge on a beach between grueling writing sessions while i traveled from cancer center to cancer center
3485005 its exhausting i definitely feel unmoored hands down i would choose new york but my career is in los angeles and trying to be a single mom i dont think i could make it in new york
3485006 i dont know how id feel if id never written the book

3485011 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3485012 the enquirer cannot be ignored but neither can it be trusted
3485013 we needed to verify the hotel allegations or at least give john edwards a chance to address them before publishing we reported aggressively but used restraint when it came to publication some readers think we did too much with this story others think we did too little i think we handled it right
3485014 were saying folks there are tools there that you can use

3485022 anti concurrent causation clauses that effectively eliminate coverage that insurers promise to provide when selling their policies but most people skip over the legalistic language if they read their policies at all and until katrina there had never been such an outpouring of challenges
3485023 theres no question that the anti concurrent clause is bad for policyholders said adam f
3485024 when you look at anti causation language it just doesnt look that important said randy j
3485025 they dont appear to be words of substance but theyre actually enormously important
3485026 the regulators look a lot more carefully at rates than they do at policy terms said gary s
3485027 its really the courts that cause insurance companies to go back and re examine their coverage terms
3485028 e i cant believe you were going to untie my swimsuit at the beach
3485029 come and listen to a story bout a man named jed a poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
3485030 about the occurrence of current philosophy of government and prospect that well have more of the same
3485031 seeing the two different john mccains is a fracture to his credibility
3485032 personally im hopeful in the list of people for the campaign to consider would be chuck hagel whether for the veep position or a serious cabinet position
3485033 i think he would be the type of republican who could represent well this country
3485034 still you have to wonder how mccain feels about all this
3485035 black liberation theology has been fostering largely unseen within the church since the 60s indeed it is likely that it would have remained hands off if not for the obama wright controversy
3485036 their focus is always on skin and not sin race and not grace gossip and not gospel racism is always focused on the outward instead of the inward because it cannot deal with the root problem of sin hatred and violence feed on bitterness and racist rage class envy does not help anyone in this life or in the next blaming others for ones own sin and guilt will not solve the problem we must take responsibility for what we do in life instead of blaming the man for our failures and woes this is why we need to break the shackle of black liberation theology which ensnares the black man and keeps him poor and hungry
3485037 black liberation theology is another name for western liberation theology which was created by white middle class european marxist liberal theologians to foster central change by manipulating the lower classes to violent revolution against democratic governments in order to establish a communist state thus black theology did not originate in africa but in europe fundamental ideas of black liberation theology did not come from black thinkers but from such white european thinkers as hegel darwin and marx
3485038 hitherto philosophers have explained the world our task is to change it
3485039 the christian faith does not possess in its nature the means for analyzing the structure of capitalism marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality and thereby help christians to see how things really are
3485040 most of those involved in black theology do not believe in the trinity the deity of christ his virgin birth sinless life vicarious death bodily resurrection literal ascension or his return to this world
3485041 everything was absolutely ideal on the day i bombed the pentagon the sky was blue the birds were singing and the bastards were finally going to get what was coming to them
3485042 in this book i intend to argue that an obama presidency would lead us into an abomination obamas radical leftist politics driven by the cult of personality he has intentionally manufactured would be an abomination in that the result of those policies would be to lead the united states in a costly and self destructive direction both at home and abroad
3485043 after an obama presidency we would be a militarily weakened and economically diminished nation instead of being more united our internal conflicts could well become more sharpened and more abrasive from four years of obama leadership
3485044 samuel etoo se queda con nosotros he decidido que contin e con nosotros es mi deseo pese a que el d a de mi presentaci n dije que no contaba con l pero tambi n dije que cuando empezaran los entrenamientos si samuel estaba aqu se ejercitar a con el resto del equipo
3485045 al fin y al cabo mi trabajo es sacar rendimiento de la gente que ponen a mi disposici n y durante estas semanas que llevamos juntos estoy encantado con su comportamiento

3485053 first and foremost i want to thank the giants and jets management for their absolute commitment to helping the njsea meet our primary purpose of providing a safe and comfortable atmosphere in which our guests may enjoy sporting and entertainment events we further recognize that an element of this experience may involve the consumption of alcoholic beverages but there will be a zero tolerance policy for misbehaving fans
3485054 the management policies announced today shall encompass three objectives staff training public education including a well publicized fan code of conduct and enforcement our goal is to have this policy stand as a model for stadiums across the country

3485056 this new alcohol policy is an excellent framework for addressing the alcohol related issues that can arise during a sports or entertainment event
3485057 we are extremely pleased with the newly formed partnership between madd nj and njsea and we look forward to working with njsea on the implementation of these new policies

3485085 the summer of spam has caught up with us this time
3485086 we are now in the situation where spam accounts for almost 90 percent of all e mail and increasingly contains links to infected sites
3485087 companies really need to employ a combination of e mail security gateways that have anti spam protection using multiple techniques to block malicious content and secure web gateway products that do not just rely on url filtering but also scan the content that end users are downloading and uploading in real time

3485095 we are pleased to report a net revenue gain during a quarter where most broadcasters experienced year over year declines looking ahead overall advertising demand apart from political spending remains weak reflecting the economic slowdown however we believe significant political spending in several of our markets will allow us to increase our share of non political dollars especially in the fall given the current environment we are also focused on reducing station and corporate expenses while prudently supporting our ability to maximize revenues despite a continued difficult m amp a market we continue to pursue all options for monetizing our station assets in the best interest of our shareholders
3485096 im quite pleased to report broad progress across achillions diverse portfolio of anti infective candidates in the second quarter of 2008 especially in our rapidly maturing hcv programs
3485097 based on its promising pre clinical profile we nominated ach 1625 as the first candidate from our internal hcv protease inhibitor program for clinical evaluation ach 1625 operates via a different but potentially synergistic mechanism from our ns4a antagonist candidate ach 1095 also now known as gs 9525 which we are developing in collaboration with gilead sciences
3485098 we also continue to make progress in our hiv and antibacterial programs notably reporting the 48 week treatment segment in our longest running elvucitabine trial as well as performing a full review of data from ach 702 wherein we discovered a potentially more comprehensive profile for this potent compound which we plan to discuss with the food and drug administration at a session scheduled for september 2008 achillion has a depth of experience across multiple indications in the anti infective area and with the completion of our recent financing we believe we have both the expertise and resources to successfully advance this portfolio

3485114 if the enjoyment of equal rights in all these respects has become established by constitutional enactment it is not by force of the xiiith amendment which merely abolishes slavery but by force of the xivth and xvth amendments
3485115 it seems to me that a blemish of this magnitude in a case thats this important really needs to be fixed
3485116 there is reason to believe this based on what davis himself said and i think he was probably himself confused about how exactly to handle the opinion
3485117 then the opinion goes from the reporter of decision who works from the first printed version and makes corrections and becomes what is called the engrossed copy
3485118 my friendship with the rivas family and seeing the work the clinic did to help them was a big part of why i decided to go back to school mid career and get a law degree

3485121 as non citizens immigrants dont enjoy all of the rights people associate with being an american

3485123 its similar to the casework experience theyll have working directly with clients after they graduate
3485124 these people were trusting me with their lives and that was a big responsibility that i was not sure i was qualified for
3485125 knowing that i was the last hope for some of the clients made me want to work harder on their behalf
3485126 the most gratifying part of my work is being able to help people who would be unlikely to find or unable to afford legal help elsewhere

3485176 thin film is really the leading edge for satisfying demand from the utility market
3485177 utilities are sophisticated buyers all they care about is the lowest cost
3485178 the whole market can see a lot of really impressive growth in the long run but thats not to say thin film will displace everything else
3485179 there are high hopes of them launching a business model with electric utilities
3485180 the utility market is a market that could be the gold mine for the solar industry but we dont know how the subsidies are going to play out
3485181 there are a number of key questions that nobody has an answer for
3485182 if the subsidy is given to utilities then all they need is first solar to come in and sell modules or systems
3485183 in that process utilities could potentially put more pressure on first solar to lower prices
3485184 assim que se cuida de gente assim que vai mudar o rio se utilizar de um servi o e n o pagar o que devido deixo meu protesto pois uma forma de mostrar o que acontece nos bastidores da campanha
3485185 minha m e est preocupada com a possibilidade de que visitar um paciente no hospital a fa a adoecer as preocupa es dela t m algum fundamento
3485186 visitar algu m no hospital n o mais arriscado do que visitar amigos em suas casas ir escola ir academia de gin stica ou fazer qualquer outra coisa que uma pessoa costume realizar diariamente como parte de seus afazeres
3485187 a quest o pode ser reduzida a manter firmemente a higiene das m os
3485188 n o toque em bandagens nos bra os ou pernas de um paciente n o encoste em qualquer secre o que ele possa apresentar ou qualquer outra coisa em que voc normalmente n o tocaria
3485189 pensamos nos hospitais como lugares sujos mas n o vivemos em um mundo limpo
3485190 os nibus s o sujos o metr sujo os visitantes de hospitais precisam ser relembrados de que abra ar as pessoas que amam permitido

3485212 weve had a lot of requests for a tool like this
3485213 so we jumped right on it and i think we came up with a tool that our affiliates will be very happy with
3485214 our lockers are right next to each other im here if he needs me if he has any questions he knows who to ask
3485215 hes been the only guy whos ever thrown the ball to me for eight years
3485216 my main job is to keep his smile on keep him happy
3485217 every now and then you can come to a situation like this and lose your focus bretts handling it well hes starting to have fun out there
3485218 i think the main thing is he finally understands the offense
3485219 hes only been here three days and guys are starting to realize why hes brett favre hes done some good things in three days i told them to just wait until he gets comfortable then theyll see
3485220 hes starting to play around with the defense a little bit everyone wants to pick off bretts ball now hes giving them a couple of different looks theres a pump fake sometimes theres two and then he goes deep on them not many people realize how quick his release is and its starting to show the guy can still play football
3485221 when youve been in only one system from college then you come to a new system its a new system its new people new coaches everything is different
3485222 hes been very good at studying hes been very good at setting an example of how to work at practice
3485223 im one of those guys i believe it when i see it
3485224 we were talking more about how it used to be in green bay
3485225 and how it would be a different adjustment for him coming from a small town green bay to the city new york its quite a change
3485226 i can understand how it would pique her interest catwoman is batmans one true love and shes tremendously popular with women
3485227 without om shanti bath salts i simply refuse to bathe
3485228 all parties that participate in the origination of a mortgage to be insured under this section shall be approved by the secretary
3485229 gerry hes just as bad as you everything has got to be perfect
3485230 check us out we have a cute stick figure family 3 boys 2 girls 1 dog a fish and look im pregnant
3485231 you must place this in the left corner of your rear windshield
3485232 did you go to that party last night i swear everyone and their dog was there
3485233 should i spend thousands on going through the legal practice course
3485234 i have been at the pacific grove chamber of commerce for 16 years
3485235 and i dont recall ever getting a phone call from someone interested in a gay wedding since the supreme court ruling i have had six calls at this little chamber from same sex couples who want to get married in our parks some have asked if our community is gay friendly we were gay friendly long before the new law was passed
3485236 having been together since 1992 in our hearts we were already married
3485237 but when we found we could be legally married we wanted to do it right away it is a big deal because generations of gay people have not been able to hold hands while walking down the street without fearing theyd be beaten or killed now here we are with the law behind us we love each other and we wanted to commit our lives to each other it is our human right to be married
3485238 what an amazingly profound gift the chamber gave me as a member of the business community
3485239 genital human papillomavirus hpv is the most common sexually transmitted infection sti the virus infects the skin and mucous membranes there are more than 40 hpv types that can infect the genital areas of men and women including the skin of the penis vulva area outside the vagina and anus and the linings of the vagina cervix and rectum you cannot see hpv most people who become infected with hpv do not even know they have it
3485240 planning to make a visceral dark horror story and says the themes of stardom are as relevant as ever
3485241 that was my immediate thought as well that the books themes of vanity and the desire for everlasting youth and beauty seem to be incredibly relevant to todays world especially in american society though dorian gray does not take place in america
3485242 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3485243 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3485244 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3485245 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3485246 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3485247 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3485248 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3485249 there will be a lot more spending by political organisations

3485257 beginning next year hoima will become a municipality because the government has agreed to elevate it to that status since bunyoro region is going to have a regional tier system of governance
3485258 we have agreed that in every region that has a regional tier the area where the headquarters are located should be a municipality thats why hoima has become a municipality
3485259 we shall have a permanent employee in every office and i appeal to you cadres to work together for the good of our party and our country
3485260 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3485261 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3485262 by providing access to the wealth of experience expertise and capability we have developed over many decades we can support trents effort in areas such as marketing stock management information systems cold chain infrastructure and front end services as they move forward with their planned expansion to 50 hypermarkets in the next five years
3485263 tesco and ourselves have agreed to a wholesale agreement where we will source our products from tescos cash amp carry operations for our star bazaar outlets this arrangement would give us access to the domestic supply chain infrastructure that tesco will set up in india over the coming years however there would be no price preference given to us
3485264 we currently sell indian products with value of over rs 1 400 crore in our uk retail business almost 90 per cent of our products for our new wholesale operation will be also be sourced locally in india
3485265 we believe that the only way to be tuned in to the needs of the market we serve is to recruit and retain local talent tesco has already invested rs 200 crore in setting up a campus which provides it financial and business services to the entire tesco group
3485266 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3485267 the tragic nature of of amys death is compounded by the involvement of these two young people
3485268 it does not only service the government there but also the ordinary zimbabweans
3485269 god forbid they should lose the brown dot they would then have to assume the worst and do more surgery
3485270 what interest would you have in requesting me as a friend we have absolutely nothing in common
3485271 did i blow a fuse again what is it with this house you run a couple of fans and the stereo and blammo no power except hmmmm every room seems to be out oh crap
3485272 its just so unfortunate because the guy hasnt had a chance because of all the variety of injuries
3485273 the plan right now is that hell have the surgery well see how the rehab goes and then well deal with it then
3485274 hmmm what could that be oh yeah this is california so it must be an earthquake
3485275 wal mart whats wal mart do they sell walls there
3485276 he is a very good boxer but i knew that i would score
3485277 it will be a tough fight but i am here to win the gold i am ready to face the world champion because i want to be the no 1 in the world i will show this on august 15
3485278 he was good he used good technique and great tactics he was better than me
3485279 he is a class boxer just look at his determination
3485280 you got to attack if you want to score points
3485281 beijing olympics features over 10 500 athletes in perfect shape
3485282 ultimately you have to be an athlete first and a beauty second but when someone is fantastic at both you are looking at a global brand
3485283 there was a noise and then suddenly explosions we didnt hear any aircraft they just came from nowhere the poor journalists never stood a chance
3485284 when crazy people smell blood its impossible to stop them you have to use surgery to stop them
3485285 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3485286 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the south ossetian zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3485287 not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3485288 another example of a quiet wave of self censorship and cultural cowardice sweeping western art circles
3485289 now appears to be the modus operandi of the transatlantic arts elites
3485290 according to human rights lawyers there are many cases of this kind before the saudi courts
3485291 i wanted to honor aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians
3485292 all i did was try to portray aisha muhammads child bride believed by most historians to have married muhammad at age nine and consummated the marriage at age 11 in the context of her times
3485293 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
3485294 were trying to come to grips with the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went parabolic in the last six years
3485295 the u s economy is at the outset of the first consumer recession since the early 1990s and its facing headwinds comparable to the six quarter recession that pushed the standard amp poors index down 40 percent in the 1970s
3485296 weve gone from housing to credit to employment and now i think were going to start to see some negative consumer spending numbers now that were past this fiscal stimulus program
3485297 generally breeding of these animals is especially difficult in captivity
3485298 but with 23 clouded leopards howletts wild animal park is one of the very few zoos to have been successful in its breeding programme with no less than 30 births since 2003

3485303 she just knows that her grandmother met a p e i soldier in 1946 after the war and he gave her the book anne of green gables and that book changed her grandmothers life
3485304 originally the producers were thinking of doing this in quebec because of the tax credit advantages but i really personally thought it was ridiculous to do
3485305 it involves anne but its not all about anne its present day p e i and people get to see what its really like here and not as it was 100 years ago
3485306 im maybe sort of projecting what the committee will recommend so i want to be ready for them

3485308 if you ban one type of phone then the person will say well i dont have that type of phone i have this other device thats not included in the legislation
3485309 youll be forever having to update your legislation or regulation because its called something else
3485310 would you marry someone you knew 100 would never be rich
3485311 im curious to hear if this would even be possible im talking about a guy that is ambitious but who will never be able to afford anything besides public school for your kids and who will never be able to go skiing or learn how to captain a boat
3485312 if a man is ambitious even in a low paying industry they can figure out how to weasle sic their way into money through some form of import export embezzlement scheme
3485313 if hes good in bed i would consider it what job is it where an ambitous guy would make no money campaign manager in the world workers party
3485314 can we define what rich is are we talking net worth under 5 million sub 400k salary some guidelines please
3485315 coincident indicators like non food credit growth cellular subscriptions and commercial vehicle sales suggest a moderation in activity rather than a sharp slowdown and we expect this trend to continue this financial year
3485316 the twin announcements corroborate our impression of a continuing slowdown in industrial growth the iip growth rate is near the lower band of our forecasts of 5 7 per cent
3485317 in terms of individual industries the highest growth segments were textiles chemicals and transport equipment the first two indicate that exports have become a significant driver for industrial growth whether this will sustain following the partial reversal in the rupee remains to be seen

3485329 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
3485330 there is still a possibility to move the talks forward and conclude the negotiations within the end 2008 time frame which all wto members have agreed since last year
3485331 one of our prime concerns is livelihood security and there has to be a solution to address that moreover interests of infant industry cannot be compromised
3485332 if the basis of the doha round has to see a change in its very objectives it would be a tough going for global trade integration revival of the weakest and not survival of the fittest should form the core of the negotiations
3485333 my simple message here in delhi and next week in washington is that wto members should look carefully at what is on the table and not on the results
3485334 my one agenda is to make the film for the audience and which is why i have made it for i think tare zameen par stars on earth has been made for the indian audience and that is my primary aim of making a film if it goes to win an award like today i have won one i am happy
3485335 i think what we can do is for every person who tries to spread poison we can spread love you know if there is a person who can explode a bomb we can light a billion candles so for every one person whether he is a politician or a terrorist who is spreading poison the rest of us can spread love thats what we can do and thats what we should do

3485344 i didnt know about this at all i only got to know it through the papers i dont think there is any kind of awkwardness between us i have been busy shooting out of the country for almost the past six months
3485345 i havent even been able to meet my parents i am sure if farah had any such issues she would tell me she is the kind who is honest about what she feels i just hope its not true

3485361 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3485362 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3485363 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3485396 calgary recorded the highest quarterly change followed by edmonton up 6 5 per cent
3485397 calgary also had the largest change up 16 5 per cent from the second quarter of 2007 followed by edmonton up 15 4 per cent
3485398 the quarterly increase was mostly the result of higher labour and fuel costs as well as material price increases in particularly steel
3485399 i think maybe the thing i am most proud of is just coming from a small town on vancouver island and playing out of a little nine hole golf course
3485400 just taking that step and going away to college lamar university in texas and being able to get through that was huge for me because i was a homesick kid and then just to get out here on tour i gave myself five years and 25 years later here i am
3485401 im sure it will be emotional for a number of reasons
3485402 its just been disappointing i havent been able to play this last year i want to go out there and do my best this week i want to play well i want to play on the weekend but to be honest with you i will be very rusty just from lack of competition lack of playing
3485403 i dont want this to be ceremonial kind of golf i want to go out and try to play well that is my goal to try and make the cut and play well and surprise myself i still feel like i can play but the golf course is a little bit hilly in spots and i am still a bit limited in how much pushing off i can do on that side its still a little bothersome i cant hit some of the types of shots i used to hit

3485408 when the policeman had me on the ground i was face up i was looking right at him and i didnt see anyone touch him
3485409 they didnt tell me anything and they only charged me with assault
3485410 the relationship between young men and the police in these hot areas is very difficult
3485411 the police are on edge because when they get out of their cars they dont know what is going to happen the young people are on edge because they feel they are being harassed
3485412 were ahead of any police department that we know of we have to continue to work on that
3485413 what happened here is an unfortunate event but will not set us back

3485437 we didnt have a fight no one cheated it plain didnt work

3485441 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts no further comment from either will be forthcoming
3485442 fully examine all their policies in relation to the collection and storage of data to ensure that incidents of this scale and nature can be avoided in future
3485443 it has come to my attention that there are recent reports circulating regarding my daughter i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly the rumors are completely false and unfounded neither reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident my family and i truly appreciate the concern and support shown to us
3485444 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3485445 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3485446 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3485447 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3485448 we must all hang together or assuredly we shall hang separately
3485449 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3485450 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3485451 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3485452 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3485453 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3485454 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3485459 every now and then you can come to a situation like this and lose your focus bretts handling it well hes starting to have fun out there

3485461 hes only been here three days and guys are starting to realize why hes brett favre hes done some good things in three days i told them to just wait until he gets comfortable then theyll see
3485462 hes starting to play around with the defense a little bit everyone wants to pick off bretts ball now hes giving them a couple of different looks theres a pump fake sometimes theres two and then he goes deep on them not many people realize how quick his release is and its starting to show the guy can still play football
3485463 when youve been in only one system from college then you come to a new system its a new system its new people new coaches everything is different

3485473 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3485474 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3485475 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3485476 i came to a fork in the road and i took it
3485477 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3485478 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3485483 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3485484 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3485490 we have a long history of protecting and preserving the environment and these projects will move us closer to our goal of running our u s operations on 15 percent renewable fuel by 2010
3485491 its part of our pledge to be better environmental stewards of the world we share
3485492 we have great employees who work hard every day to ensure our breweries are conserving water energy and raw materials as part of our blue ocean initiative an enhanced productivity plan to deliver more than 1 billion in savings through 2010
3485493 with our blue ocean project were examining everything we do to make sure we are brewing our beers in a way thats efficient considers our environmental impacts and maintains the high standards of quality our customers expect when they drink a budweiser
3485494 any bacteria on his skin could have been deposited giving people food poisoning
3485495 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3485496 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3485497 our peacekeepers are continuing to perform their duties and will continue to do so because they are a key factor for upholding security in the caucasus
3485498 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery

3485502 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3485503 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3485504 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3485505 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3485506 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3485507 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3485508 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3485509 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3485510 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3485511 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3485512 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3485513 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3485514 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3485515 we plan to save the cells where doors can open wider for accepting ice samples

3485519 uns wurde geantwortet dass ohne eine letztinstanzliche entscheidung ob die spieler gegen das arbeitsrecht versto en haben keine m glichkeit sei vorzugehen

3485544 in the previous matches cristiane did not score so todays goals were important both for her and the our team
3485545 our target is win the gold medal now is the time to fight for that
3485546 im delighted by the three goals i scored its the second time in the olympics
3485547 the important thing is that my goals helped brazil to win
3485548 the defense left a loose ball in the air and i took advantage of that mistake and tried what we call a half bicycle kick and i was lucky it went in
3485549 we all know marta is the best player in the world and will come up against tough defense
3485550 didnt play her best in the last game were glad she found her shape and scored three goals today
3485551 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3485552 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3485553 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3485554 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3485555 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to proves to be a step towards de escalation
3485556 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus
3485557 the storm sewers didnt have the capacity for the amount of storm water we received

3485561 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3485562 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3485563 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3485564 we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3485565 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3485566 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3485567 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3485568 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3485569 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3485570 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3485571 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened

3485592 the visibility was extremely poor with patchy fog so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on our navigation activities
3485593 shortly after dark the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported light bearing on the starboard bow
3485594 the captain called out is it steady or moving astern
3485595 the lookout replied steady captain which meant that we were on a collision course with that source of light

3485643 the history of the cherokee removal of 1838 as gleaned by the author from the lips of actors in the tragedy may well exceed in weight of grief and pathos any other passage in american history under scotts orders the troops were disposed at various points throughout the cherokee country where stockade forts were erected for gathering in and holding the indians preparatory to removal from these squads of troops were sent to search out with rifle and bayonet every small cabin hidden away in the coves or by the sides of mountain streams to seize and bring in as prisoners all the occupants however or wherever they might be found families at dinner were startled by the sudden gleam of bayonets in the doorway and rose up to be driven with blows and oaths along the weary miles of trails that led to the stockades men were seized in their fields or going along the road women were taken from their spinning wheels and children from their play in many cases on turning for one last look as they crossed the ridge they saw their homes in flames fired by the lawless rabble that followed on the heels of the soldiers to loot and pillage so keen were the outlaws on the scent that in some instances they were driving off the cattle and other stock of the indians almost before the soldiers had fairly started their owners in the other direction systematic hunts were made by the same men for indian graves to rob them of the silver pendants and other valuables deposited with the dead volunteer afterward a colonel in the confederate service said i fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by thousands but the cherokee removal was the cruelest work i ever knew to prevent escape the soldiers had been ordered to approach and surround each house so far as possible so as to come upon the occupants without warning one old patriarch when thus surprised calmly called his children and grandchildren around him and kneeling down bid them pray with him in their own language while the astonished soldiers looked on in silence then rising he led the way into exile a woman on finding the house surrounded went to the door and called up her chickens to be fed for the last time after which taking her infant on her back and her two other children by the hand she followed her husband with the soldiers all were not thus submissive one old man named tsali charley was seized with his wife his brother his three sons and their families exasperated at the brutality accorded his wife who being unable to travel fast was prodded with bayonets to hasten her steps he urged the other men to join with him in a dash for liberty as he spoke in cherokee the soldiers although they heard understood nothing until each warrior suddenly sprang upon the one nearest and endeavored to wrench his gun from him the attack was so sudden and so unexpected that one soldier was killed and the rest fled while the indians escaped to the mountains hundreds of others some of them from the various stockades managed to escape to the mountains from time to time where those who did not die of starvation subsisted on roots and wild berries until the hunt was over finding it impracticable to secure these fugitives general scott finally tendered them a proposition that if they would surrender charley and his party for punishment the rest would be allowed to remain until their case could be adjusted by the government on hearing of this proposition charley voluntarily came in with his sons offering himself as a sacrifice for his people by command of general scott charley his brother and the two elder sons were shot near the mouth of the tuckasegee a detachment of cherokee prisoners being compelled to do the shooting in order to impress upon the indians the fact of their utter helplessness those fugitives permitted to remain became the present eastern band of cherokee in october 1838 the long procession of exiles was set in motion a very few went by the river route by which the army had taken the earlier groups the rest nearly all of the 13 000 went overland hiwassee at a ferry above gunstocker creek they proceeded down the river the sick the old people and the smaller children with the blankets cooking pots and other belongings in wagons the rest on foot or on horses the number of wagons was 645 it was like the march of an army regiment after regiment the wagons in the center the officers along the line and the horsemen on the flanks and at the rear tennessee river a short distance above jollys island at the mouth of the where the noted chief whitepath in charge of a detachment sickened and died his people buried him by the roadside with a box over the grave and poles with streamers around it that others coming on behind might note the spot and remember him somewhere also along that march of death for the exiles died by tens and twenties every day of the journey the devoted wife of john ross was lost leaving him to go on with the bitter pain of bereavement added to heartbreak at the ruin of his nation was crossed at a ferry near the mouth of the and the army passed on through southern missouri it was now the middle of winter with the river running full of ice so that several detachments were obliged to wait some time on the eastern bank for the channel to become clear memories still exist of that halt beside the frozen river with hundreds of sick and dying penned up in wagons or stretched upon the ground and only a blanket overhead to keep out the january blast the crossing was made at last in two divisions at and at greens ferry a short distance below whence the march was on through the later detachments making a northerly circuit by because those who had gone before had killed off all the game along the direct route at last their destination was reached they had started in october 1838 and it was now march 1839 the journey having occupied nearly six months of the hardest part of the year

3485648 we immediately become more effective when we decide to change ourselves rather than asking things to change for us
3485649 this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we asked of him
3485650 the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective

3485666 and were pleased with ourselves because weve kept out of a war but if you ask me i think a war would do us all the good in the world

3485673 very valuable it gave the coaches a chance to know they can trust me a chance to really see what i can do in a game it gave me confidence

3485682 was ich auf dieser g nsefarm gesehen habe werde ich nie wieder vergessen heute noch verfolgen mich die schrecklichen bilder etwa 3000 g nse denen man kurz zuvor die federn ausgerissen hatte lebendrupf nennt man das eigentlich war ich der meinung dass es so etwas im zivilisierten europa nicht mehr gibt was f r ein furchtbarer irrtum ich war am 28 august meiner eigenschaft als obfrau der tierhilfe s den unterwegs in ungarn zu einem hundeheim bei cs d kam ich an einer g nsefarm vorbei was ich sah schockierte mich zutiefst die tiere sahen erb rmlich aus sie standen fast regungslos keines schnatterte sie froren hatten stumpfe augen und blutige stellen am ganzen k rper es lag ein solcher schmerz ber dem ganzen ich war entsetzt bei lebendigem leib hatte man diesen gutm tigen tieren die federn ausgerissen lebendrupf oh gott denken sie nur daran wie weh es tut sich haare b schelweise auszurei en federn aber sitzen noch viel fester in der haut manche tiere hatten die marter nicht berlebt sie lagen tot in der ecke ich habe das alles fotografiert dann musste ich schnell weg ganz schnell sonst h tte ich mich bergeben oder losgeheult das habe ich dann sp ter ohnehin getan vor ort konnte ich nichts ausrichten aber von hier aus werde ich alles tun um diese tierqu lerei zu beenden
3485683 in vielen gesch ften wei man gar nicht ob die ware aus lebendrupf stammt
3485684 die federpapillen eines vogels sind sehr reich mit nervenrezeptoren ausgestattet und schmerzempfindlich das ausrupfen von federn ohne bet ubung ist deshalb als tierschutzrelevant einzustufen tierfreudne sollten aus diesem grund auf daunenprodukte die von g nsen stammen verzichten im gegensatz dazu werden die daunen von eiderenten aus nistmaterial gewonnen allerdings nicht gerupft
3485685 die gesch ftsleute die stolz darauf sind und sich auf t v vorschriften berufen sollten einmal beim rupfen dabei sein sie w rden danach anders denken
3485686 aber ich habe mittlerweile firmen ausfindig gemacht die ausschlie lich federn von toten tieren verkaufen
3485687 wir haben 2 mal im jahr gerupft zur mauser mir soll niemand sagen dass das den g nsen nicht weh tut wir mussten ihen die beine zusammenbinden und ihren kopf zwischen unsere beinen klemmen sie haben f rchterlich geschrien und sie haben tage gebraucht bis sie sich halbwegs wieder erholt hatten

3485697 la mayor a de las fiestas que celebramos en nuestro mbito cultural e hist rico tienen origen cristiano independientemente de que algunas fueran colocadas coincidiendo con fiestas paganas o ancestrales para contrarrestar el influjo de religiones superadas o de supersticiones

3485708 in life we do things some we wish we had never done some we wish we could replay a million times in our heads but they all make us who we are and in the end those experiences shape every detail about us if we were to reverse any of them we wouldnt be at the exact place that we are today so just live make mistakes and have wonderful times but never ever second guess who you are where you have been and most importantly where it is that you are going

3485740 that their protests were already helping to lower oil prices
3485741 hard evidence is emerging that the changing behavior of consumers and businesses may be making a dent in the oil market the energy department reported last week that demand for gasoline for the four weeks ended aug 1 was 2 3 lower than in the same period last year declining demand is the prime force behind the oil markets recent slide
3485742 the international energy agency said oil prices will remain high despite their recent drop and lessened demand in developed countries
3485743 a stronger u s dollar is also pushing oil prices down
3485744 after republicans have spent years ignoring americans struggle with high gas prices its amazing that minority leader boehner and his grand oil party colleagues in the house now believe that their words are lowering gas prices
3485745 minority leader boehner and republicans in congress should now use their magic words to address other economic squeeze issues republicans have long been ignoring while middle class americans struggle to make ends meet in that spirit we suggest a few issues that house republicans ought to stop ignoring and start talking about so that those costs also decline rising unemployment rates increasing grocery prices and the skyrocking cost of health care
3485746 in order to balance our budget we actually did over the course of the year a 4 million reduction in our overall budget

3485751 weve seen this decrease now during the later part of july and the first part of august which is great for the consumer
3485752 consumers are using less were down close to four percent in usage
3485753 anytime you have a decline in consumption of any product the price normally comes down
3485754 what the american public needs to do is to continue to conserve and as long as that happens thats a good indication of what will happen with the retail price

3485781 the visibility was extremely poor with patchy fog so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on our navigation activities
3485782 shortly after dark the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported light bearing on the starboard bow
3485783 the captain called out is it steady or moving astern
3485784 the lookout replied steady captain which meant that we were on a collision course with that source of light
3485785 the captain then called to the signalman signal that ship we are on a collision course advise you change course 20 degrees
3485786 back came the signal from the other ship advisable for you to change course 20 degrees
3485787 the captain barked send im a captain change course 20 degrees immediately

3485810 today the internet has radically changed the dynamics of bullying cyber bullying is a growing problem nearly one in six us children grades 6 ten is a victim each year
3485811 social networking web sites chat rooms instant messaging and blogs are likely areas where this could occur
3485812 cyber bullies aim to intimidate harass belittle and hurt people
3485813 if parents are aware of the signs that their child is involved in cyberbullying they will be able to make better choices and help protect their child
3485814 in a technical sense export and domestic demand are created equal but just in the sense of judging the health of the economy theyre not created equal
3485815 if youre looking at the output data the economys holding up surprisingly well
3485816 if you were just looking at the employment data youd be concluding that the u s is in a recession
3485817 gdp excluding the foreign sector youve had pretty bad numbers
3485818 whether youre selling to a domestic consumer or abroad its still production
3485819 when you measure household wages in terms of their output prices it looks good when you measure it in terms of the things they want to buy it looks bad
3485820 what we export buys less and less in terms of imports
3485821 one reason why the economy maybe feels worse than headline gdp says
3485822 were starting from a place where weve done far too little manufacturing production
3485823 were going to have a couple of years where consumption drags behind gdp

3485836 i think due to the weather conditions as well the hot and humid weather and the rains as for the previous olympic games the first couple of days there were not many spectators that show up
3485837 as from today we will get more spectators into the stadium
3485838 there are too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers to sit in them but if people will come over for these empty seats then they will stand up and go and let the ticket holders have their seats

3485841 ours are for july sales made in the same month and therefore will always give a more current picture of the market
3485842 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3485843 its not surprising that auckland is finding itself very much at the epicentre of the current economic recession and in particular the continued fallout from the finance sector collapses and its therefore understandable that confidence in the auckland residential market at this point is pretty low
3485844 however the fact is that for the market nationally to achieve an unchanged median price against the pressure of the declining auckland market is a remarkably good result in the circumstances and it is beginning to look like the june months figures may have given a poor reading of the markets health
3485845 if you regard the annual percentage change as a yardstick then you would have to say at best the trendline is certainly not deteriorating as much as some would have you believe and on a month to month basis a slight improvement can be detected
3485846 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people talking about a 10 decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3485847 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought

3485869 i was on a bus and saw this gnome in the garden i think it was fate i mentally tagged it and went back the night before i left and liberated it sometime before midnight
3485870 i felt a degree of guilt as it could have been a treasured heirloom it is not something i am proud of i produced the album because i felt i owed it my best i wanted them to have the best photographs
3485871 the gnome was a great icebreaker on the trip it made friends with a lot of people it was difficult getting it through customs every time it appeared on the scanner they demanded to see it
3485872 but i have warned simon not to do it again
3485873 theres more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3485874 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3485875 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3485876 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3485877 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3485878 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3485879 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3485880 it was the strangest gift i have ever received i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise
3485881 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3485882 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3485883 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3485884 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3485885 said hello to the big man and he seemed a decent enough bloke but unfortunately i didnt have my camera with me
3485886 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3485887 the average new car loses 12 2 of its value in the first year according to edmunds com on a 20 000 car thats 2 440 or more than 200 a month some cars depreciate even faster depending on demand incentives offered and other factors why not let someone else take that hit not only will you be able to save money or buy more car but youll pay less for insurance

3485893 they explain what it takes to come to college especially here
3485894 universities can reach out but they have to reach out to everyone
3485895 were focusing on students with low income and disadvantaged backgrounds
3485896 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school
3485897 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
3485898 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort

3485903 she talked about how she and her brother made their own puppets and her love of puppeteering
3485904 its come with some hard work over the past five years to become a jurisdiction that has gone from mediocre to a province that now leads on energy conservation and is starting to get results
3485905 im across the country on a regular basis looking at various issues and seeing whos at the table ontario quebec manitoba b c consistently there consistently there
3485906 we need to see more participation from some of the other provinces
3485907 it wasnt until some time later where environment became a key issue in the minds of canadians that the government really realized that they had to re address and re prioritize energy efficiency

3485909 ours did not come into effect until after the timing of this report

3485911 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3485912 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3485913 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3485914 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3485915 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3485916 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3485917 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions

3485930 my mood is dark and not in a good happy way
3485931 i went through the exact same thing with the doberman pinscher breed in the 70s the exact same thing
3485932 and you know something you dont hear about dobermans anymore and you know something else the dog has not changed the doberman is still a doberman but the people who own them are different
3485933 its a multi prong problem in that it is a lack of education on the part of the owners because if they did have more education then maybe they could be more responsible

3485943 it made me mad at heath ledger for killing himself
3485944 just like now whether walking standing sitting or reclining responding to situations and dealing with people as they come everything is the way
3485945 all dharmas are mind dharmas all names are mind names
3485946 for instance though the reflections of the moon are many the real moon is only one
3485947 all dharmas are buddhadharmas and all dharmas are liberation liberation is identical with suchness all dharmas never leave suchness whether walking standing sitting or reclining everything is always inconceivable function the sutras say that the buddha is everywhere
3485948 like a cloud in the sky that suddenly appears and then is gone without leaving any traces also like writing on water neither born nor perishable this is the great nirvana
3485949 not obliterating the conditioned not dwelling in the unconditioned the conditioned is the function of the unconditioned the unconditioned is the essence of the conditioned because of not dwelling on support it has been said like space which rest on nothing
3485950 the sravakas hear about the buddha nature while the bodhisattvas eye perceives the buddha nature

3486017 o crescimento da economia estimula os investimentos em pesquisa e a inova o e importante ajustar algumas regulamenta es para estimular os pedidos de patentes das companhias brasileiras

3486030 labels are good if they help you understand whats going on and bad if they lock you into some sort of fixed category where you either dont believe you can get out or perhaps worse start to feel comfortable and liberated from your own responsibility for your life and health
3486031 somehow in the last generation of doctors we seem to have lost our ability or perhaps our perceived right to give patients advice about their health only if we diagnose them with a disease or pre disease do we have something to tell them
3486032 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate
3486033 weve never analyzed these activities its always been a part of the show part of the fun nominations are part the pageantry of the convention
3486034 pray for us before our annual convention next week we are being overtaken by fundamentalists who want power have lots of money and defame you if you dont support them
3486035 but with this development we learn that planning to vote for hillary the winner of at over 18 million democratic votes is an act of defiance an act of disunity
3486036 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3486037 that i wasnt on the unity train amp took it august 12th 2008 at 2 33 pm said

3486039 and lo there was a conflict in georgia and the sound of it reached the obamessiahs ears and he was not pleased
3486040 giving up his church said moderator someone posted some pretty ugly stuff on sunday its on your head howard dean might want to take it down said millstone told a fellow delegate in what she believed was a private e mail exchange that she was not sure she could vote for obama at the democratic national convention later this month private e mail exchange hmmm looks like bzeros vote on fisa is working out for him said prolix big brother obama is watching you we can intimidate back dnc nervous heck yeah sds nervous heck yeah want hillary nominated heck yeah game changer hello fellow pumas we finally have some momentum on our side wrt a blistering viral video campaign one theme obama fails commander in chief test 3am moment has come and gone but obama fails please help us with scripts resources ideas or just simply passing the link along http www hillaryclintonforum net discussion showthread php t 23287 it will take a couple days before geekloves friend can begin the construction of the videos once created and distributed to sds media and internet this will help us change the game there is no way that all sds will continue to push such a weak candidate newhorizon saw the video amp comments jeez louise what is this a race for the democrats to look stupid tim kaine sounds like a blithering idiot what does he know he thinks it is right not to have hillarys name on the ballot while the men have always had theirs what is wrong with these people august 12th 2008 at 3 14 pm said stanley kurtz has a new article out with information from obamas time in the illinois senate pretty interesting stuff this information could really hurt obama especially with hispanics the wheels are about to come off bzeros surfboard after 4 days hes still trying to say something relevant about georgia other than peach waffles sound good august 12th 2008 at 3 21 pm said when the mccain campaign does an ad on russia georgia ill bet they use the kaine voice over a pic of bzero surfing in hi any takers on the bet said delphyne ive never lived anywhere else except for one freezing year in ann arbor cheers with a glass of sonomas best to you tonight august 12th 2008 at 3 28 pm said pofed wanna bet olby does a speshul komment on it too calls the best analysis evah of course if theres any fighting still going which appears to be the case itll be hillarys fault natch you are right about needing a special forum for voters rights in light of the corruption in play in the democratic primary i think this needs to be on the puma prowl list oldcoastie on august 12th 2008 at 2 54 pm said i wish i could remember the link but someone posted on another site that obamas color is yellow cowardice refuses to debate hrc refuses to town halls with mccain refuses to place clintons name on roll call this is one frightened man growing weaker and weaker by the minute said ms millstone needs to make public the name of the stasi informant who turned her in to the obama headquarters for questioning everyone in the world needs to know that person cannot keep any kind of confidential information to her himself and everyone can avoid them including employers said there seems to be a grown trend over at mydd of posting comments from here and other puma sites for comic effect here is the latest said yessuh democrats get in line here for the say or look stupid democratic roller coaster ride no hurry folks dont crowd theres plenty of time before november no not you hillary everyone knows you cant ride this one said downticket i totally agree but isnt it great that simofishs video has gone viral into the heart of colbama nation and they are nervous of course stephen showed himself to be the uninformed misogynistic jerk that emerged during the primary said just read that hillary willnot be speaker on tuesday she has been moved to speak w others on the econ said one of the things that has really boggled my mind is how ignorant obama supporters actually are of the process i mean its obvious mccain is the nominee because he got enough delegates through elections to win the nomination obama did not so he has not won why do they just keep chanting she lost get over it she did not loose no one has won or lost is it the pathetic state of education in this country or just an embrace of expedient stupidity said even the news calls him the presumed nominee that should tell them something said prolix peach waffles omg are we sure he really didnt say that as for this tactic of giving oba moi credit for developments in the real world such as the timetable thing maliki agrees with obama and the ceasefire in georgia already violated well its inane beyond words newsflash oba moi is not the f cking president no one cares what he says except our drooling press corpse and his robotic minions pooty poot is certainly not basing his foreign policies on the vague mouthings of a very junior senator from illinois said i think jesse jackson was beaten by some one who hacked off obamas balls a long time ago hes obviously afraid hell get outmaneuvered in the convention and loose http www cnn com 2008 politics 08 12 clinton index html iref werecommend new from cnn will clintons name go into nomination said janet isnt it interesting it would never occur to these so called democrats to even think that we mave have a point about anything all they know how to do is mock and ridicule i find the constant accusations that we are republicans absolutely hilarious yes no one but republicans could possibly be concerned about obamas lack of qualifications his serial flip flopping his vote against the fourth amendment his nasty and divisive campaign said overall between 1972 and 1992 10 democratic candidates who lost the nomination in the primaries went on to have their names formally placed in nomination at the convention significantly however none of them publicly endorsed their opponent months before the convention as clinton did in june

3486046 in a week the israeli cabinet will meet to decide if any more will be selected to come to israel even for those selected the bureaucratic process will take many more months we are feeling hungrier thirstier and more tired during this tisha bav fast but for the falas mura jews tisha bav will not end tonight there will be hunger weariness and despair unless we help

3486075 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3486076 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3486077 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3486078 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3486079 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3486080 om du vill ha l sare eller sk dare s nk dig till deras niv g r dig sj lv lika platt medioker ful och skamlig som de
3486081 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3486082 they are giving priority to saddleback members said larry ross a spokesman for saddleback
3486083 there are 100 000 regular attenders up and down south california with only 5 000 seats available there arent even enough tickets to go around to saddleback members
3486084 we couldnt accommodate everybody said ross he said church officials had hoped to have some tickets for the public but that became impossible when they realized they couldnt satisfy all the church members who wanted a chance to see the republican and democratic presidential hopefuls
3486085 the original intent was that anything beyond a production costs would go toward the peace plan ross said
3486086 its a way for saddleback members to participate in that effort
3486087 i dont think anybody thought going in that this was going to be a fundraiser said barbaro who as of now hasnt received any tickets for local democratic activists
3486088 it seems that this will skew the audience to a more well heeled republican element
3486089 especially young democrats who had been online trying to get in and now will have absolutely no chance to see this by virtue of the expense
3486090 i think the pricing structure you referenced is consistent with other events like this that have been held throughout the primaries ross added
3486091 this event is nothing more than a thinly veiled fundraiser for saddleback church gia lugo of san juan capistrano said in an e mail to the register
3486092 disappointed that both candidates would agree to participate in a church fundraiser the register this morning asked both campaigns to comment on the way tickets are being distributed
3486093 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3486094 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3486128 i am especially interested in the events which lead up to the club being placed into administration a few years back and in hearing submissions about the governance of the club then as well as hearing about wider issues relating to wrexham
3486129 the benefits are that they allow us to manage our clients and their work and our time and our stuff more efficiently and quicker and easier they essentially allow us to get on with what we are paid to do help solve our clients problems with minimal problems we have found that by spending less time and effort managing our business we can spend more time and effort helping our clients to run their businesses
3486130 it is the first time that we have had a theory of this strength breadth and depth in cognitive neuroscience
3486131 the brain is an inferential agent optimising its models of whats going on at this moment and in the future
3486132 its a general computational principle that can explain how the brain handles problems ranging from low level perception to high level cognition
3486133 mathematically free energy is always bigger than surprise therefore if you can minimise free energy you can avoid surprising encounters with the world
3486134 in short everything that can change in the brain will change to suppress prediction errors from the firing of neurons to the wiring between them and from the movements of our eyes to the choices we make in daily life
3486135 i do not think it is testable and i am pretty sure it does not tell you how to build a machine which emulates some aspect of intelligence
3486136 this would i think be an aspect of the theory that could be proved or falsified
3486137 it is quite certainly the most advanced conceptual framework regarding an application of these ideas to brain function in general
3486138 fristons work is pivotal it resonates entirely with the sort of model that i would like to see emerge
3486139 the final equation you write on a t shirt will be quite simple
3486140 it will take time to spin off all of the consequences of the theory but i take that property as a sure sign that this is a very important theory
3486141 most other models including mine are just models of one small aspect of the brain very limited in their scope this one falls much closer to a grand theory
3486142 pregnant victim was repeatedly thrown to the ground and spit on
3486143 many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprang up
3486144 a lot of my focus has been to help the company as we have evolved from what was once a magazine web site and some media events to a more diversified media company to go from start up to scale up
3486145 contribute to the bottom line and contribute to the greater good of society
3486146 digital will actually overtake the print side of the business in a couple years from a share of revenue perspective

3486164 a complex attack defense control point map with some unique gameplay unlike most tf2 maps capturing a control point modifies the layout of the map opening and closing routes for each team as a result the offensive team has a wide variety of tactical choices around how theyd like to assault the final point should they use scouts and soldiers to rush the final point with only the routes they start with should they go for the side control points and open up more routes to the final should they capture extra points to shut down the defenders routes the many choices keep the map interesting for a long time providing a wide variety of experiences in a game

3486166 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3486167 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3486168 the main news is that after a protracted period of discussion weve come to an agreement on a slightly different approach
3486169 there are also many areas on which we will agree
3486170 im hoping our debate will give the public a better understanding of why these differing views on planets serve the different purposes of various kinds of scientists and will illuminate the extent to which those purposes are narrow or broad
3486171 this was comparable to or more than the number who voted in favor of the iaus planet definition in 2006
3486172 if pluto were half the mass of uranus it would still not be a planet
3486173 and if the earth traded places with jupiter earth would not be a planet its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table

3486311 inflation is a compelling reason why clients would want to have a stock exposure in their portfolios depending on their age
3486312 what investors should be worried about is what are the future expectations for future earnings
3486313 for investors in the equity markets they need to think about which companies can grow their businesses in such an environment
3486314 who has pricing power foreign exposure and the ability to grow a business in a declining u s economy
3486315 it eats away at the purchasing power of the portfolio and as the fed raises rates it also decreases the value of the bonds
3486316 i expect inflation to continue because the fed is under pressure to keep interest rates low to combat the credit crisis
3486317 the demise of the dollar and why its great for your investments
3486318 we are in a recession and that will lead to a decline in other high cost items such as gas and groceries
3486319 those prices will come down in the next six months without the feds taking any further action on interest rates
3486320 we think the way to hedge portfolios from the effects of inflation is to invest in carefully selected stocks
3486321 stocks have historically since 1925 averaged about 10 percent a year and that beats inflation over that time period by 3 5 percent he also suggestions etfs such as rogers global commodity index rji protected bonds and reits
3486322 the emotion behind money building wealth from the inside out
3486323 are the only thing shown to outpace inflation in the last 100 years bonds savings accounts and cds are terrible now i think we are doing a great job as a country with inflation compared to the 1970s by keeping interest rates low but we are in uncharted waters and only time will tell
3486324 we know very little about the toxicity of these chemicals
3486325 is it really necessary to have your tv withstand an open flame for 10 minutes

3486327 i said i havent heard of any of these actors
3486328 then i ended up just falling in love with all of them
3486329 to be honest that was kind of the pull it was such a bizarro scenario it was so bizarre i kind of almost couldnt get my head around it but i thought god this is really going to be an experience this is a whole different culture this is a different part of america that i havent experienced and it turned out to be a positive
3486330 this is a guys comedy road movie and they need a reason to drive the story and its tobys love for this girl
3486331 life in the big city had brought home to her what home was and he was a part of that
3486332 i was actually amazed at how relaxed toby could be hes a really confident guy but hes also humble
3486333 he is very in the moment and actually quite good at improvising ive worked with professional actors way less instinctive than him it was a very nice surprise
3486334 as an actor you get used to being uncomfortable if youre not in freezing cold water in the middle of winter then youre bound and gagged
3486335 i mean i didnt know how big all these guys were i knew who willie nelson was but pretty much everybody else i didnt know and so i was learning as i made the movie and there were all these wonderful iconic country western guys who did cameos and toby would be so in awe and hed speak so highly of them and educate me
3486336 they would sing and then rodney was always one joke after another so it was hard to stay serious and then once we got into politics it was all over michael salomon the director would be screaming at us to get to set and act
3486337 my mom always tells me to keep an eye on her
3486338 we recognize that pets are extremely important to the overwhelming majority of our customers and we wanted to do something to acknowledge that bond
3486339 to be honest i dont think weve had anybody worry about it one way or another
3486340 theres a lot of little details that companies offer im sure somebody thought this was a pretty good idea
3486341 people pay for anything for their pets these days i could see people wanting this
3486342 but nowadays people will spend thousands of dollars for their pets health and thats gotten publicity
3486343 what it means is it is for any fully domesticated animal and that can be a dog a cat a reptile or a rodent
3486344 it has to be a pet your pet cow that you plan to kill and eat does not count

3486353 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3486354 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3486355 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane

3486375 we must immediately call a meeting of the nato council to estimate georgias security and consider the measures which nato may take to stabilize the highly dangerous situation
3486376 the international community needs to deploy independent and neutral peacemaking forces in south ossetia russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw troops from the sovereign territory of georgia
3486377 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border
3486378 we decided to redeploy our troops to be able to resist the russian armed forces which outnumber our troops

3486404 this targeting of mdc mps quite a number of whom are still facing criminal charges even though many of them are out on bail is for us clear evidence that zanu pf as a political party is not coming to the table in good faith and its credibility as a political partner has to be called in to question

3486454 more and more god is teaching me to trust him for every step i take he constantly calls me to stretch beyond what is comfortable to walk through new territory when i would rather stay with the familiar to face difficult physical mental and emotional challenges to do things i know i cant achieve without his power each time something is required of me that im certain i am unable to accomplish on my own strength i see a picture of just one or two steps being illuminated while those before and after are engulfed in darkness and cannot be seen this describes my walk with god i trust him for each day of life grateful for every breath determined to look for the blessing in the moment no matter the circumstances i follow his lead even when i cannot see where i am going even when it scares me to do so because deep within my spirit i know that these simple steps of faith are preparing me for eternity

3486464 google s acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the search market this will likely challenge the current dominance of yandex and although we continue to assume that yandex will maintain its leading position we believe that there is now debate as to whether russia will become a google country
3486465 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by google s inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction

3486498 so far this has only been fixed in an informal political form
3486499 it requires the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force this is a key point
3486500 this is an absolutely binding condition that the georgian side is to pull back its forces not only from south ossetia but also from other areas of georgia from which they can shell and bomb the region
3486501 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them

3486537 i get speeches a lot that i dont give i dont want to be too critical of people who draft my speeches but i get a lot of speeches in draft that i never use they have no relationship with what i say
3486538 i havent bothered asking because im not interested in it
3486539 the social security legislation is very clear about what a relationship is youre either single or a couple a couple is in the nature of marriage which includes civil union and de facto
3486540 its been the same for years its been tested in court theres no interest in changing it
3486541 i get draft speeches from the department all the time sometimes its msd sometimes its dol department of labour sometimes its health sometimes its education it depends what the speech is
3486542 ive got no idea im sort of not interested because i didnt say it and its not our policy
3486543 there would be nobody in msd who is under any illusion that that is government policy
3486544 it sounds like a secret agenda to me i dont think that speeches miraculously appear on the governments website without anyone knowing who put them there

3486572 ive been doing this for 12 years and the primary typically has a low turnout
3486573 i leaned toward voting for candidates who had their information available online
3486574 i was disappointed that some of the candidates didnt have their own web sites so you could read their biography and their background
3486575 i heard about it in the news so there wasnt any confusion for me
3486576 but i could see why someone who doesnt watch the news might have that problem
3486577 i read everything and i watch everything on tv too

3486580 indie was once edgy but now its mostly serene but san francisco has a hold out finest dearest has essentially ignored the current indie scene their new self titled album on bloodtown records could easily fit among discs by the powerful women of 90s indie rock the blaring amps and drums are a welcome reminder of how much impact indie rock can have
3486581 your opinion of finest dearest may very well rest on how much you like 90s indie rock an unabashed throwback to the lo fi glory days of k records and kill rock stars the san francisco five piece delivers a moody crunch amid various modes of catharsis carly schneiders bittersweet vocals bring out the bygone era even more alternately recalling sleater kinney and tiger trap thats not to say finest dearest isnt satisfying in its own right the group gets plenty of variety from its storminess
3486582 the new album features many of the much loved classic finest dearest elements like stepping stone melodies and powerful guitars but with a few more

3486590 the captain then called to the signalman signal that ship we are on a collision course advise you change course 20 degrees

3486868 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3486869 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3486870 we have at times had to choose between baby food and heating fuel
3486871 by february we ran out of wood and i burned my mothers dining room furniture
3486872 not spending those ten hours at home with my husband and son makes a big difference
3486873 we also only eat two meals a day to conserve

3486875 the pennies have all but dried up today i am sad broken and very discouraged
3486876 i dont go to church many sundays because the gasoline is too expensive to drive there

3486886 having himself crowned messiah at a bipartisan gathering of congressmen

3486892 as soon as they started talking about it back in february we saw crime jump
3486893 criminals know were short staffed now were seeing people coming here from richmond and oakland because they think its fertile ground
3486894 i think for the police to say they cant handle certain crimes is completely irresponsible disrespectful and for people who live here very threatening
3486895 im here because i love vallejo but its a simple numbers game the more cops we have the more effective we can be
3486896 we just moved here from richmond and ive slept better than i have in years
3486897 theres not as many sirens or ambulances i feel much safer here and i think the police have been great

3486915 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3486916 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3486917 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved

3486952 in a biological context when two rather similar species i e energy transduction mechanisms compete for the same source of energy e g food the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms e g claws teeth feet etc captures more than the other
3486953 gradually the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other
3486954 let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah
3486955 consequently this cheetah will catch more food i e more energy will channel through this individual the path has become steeper likewise a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep in this case the non mutated paths are the healthy rivalries and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition
3486956 a system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings
3486957 that is to say when the surrounding environment is high in energy then the system will evolve to a high energy stationary state matter on earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density during this process mechanisms of energy transduction have improved but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non renewables

3486975 weve just seen over the last few days as the russians invaded a sovereign nation georgia and watch the response of this man john mccain to that crisis right strong clear principled the kind of president we need in the white house over the next four years to be there to protect our country our security and our freedom
3486976 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not you never know we never know when we elect a president what crisis will occur in the four years of his watch

3486999 however its inevitable because there are so few data in this area of the arctic there will be great interest in using this data

3487025 spirit about two that afternoon i got a phone call from a previous co worker who had moved on to better things
3487026 blayne can you do me a favor man im late to the dentist can you park that car
3487027 i always hope for the best but expect the worst
3487028 you will see a lot more guys making the switch
3487029 since i made the switch ive had guys who i dont want to name ringing me up and saying they are interested in coming over to union
3487030 they see that union is at a really good level now whereas five years ago maybe the premiership was a little lower profile but the game has really picked up
3487031 myself and lesley had talked about wanting to switch codes he left bradford earlier than planned but we kept close contact
3487032 i knew i wanted to make the switch as well so having decided that it was then about finding a club that was going to suit me
3487033 i had a couple of agents looking for me and when the opportunity arose to come to bath after olly barkley had signed for gloucester i knew it was the place i wanted to be
3487034 the reason why i chose to switch now was because i felt i had achieved everything at bradford and i felt it was better to do it now rather than leave it to a later date and think what if
3487035 all the feedback from lesley about rugby union was positive and i thought i would really like to be in that position as well
3487036 for me it is about making the switch learning the rules and my first goal of making the bath starting line up
3487037 you cant really ask someone if they want to play for england if they are sitting in the stand watching
3487038 again its just fundamental errors that we make across the paddock in all aspects of the game that we really need to cut out
3487039 its not one sort of particular thing its just basic errors that we shouldnt be making at this level and were making too many of them and costing us dearly at the moment
3487040 we ended up defending a lot more than we would have liked to and didnt really get a chance to impose our attack on the game
3487041 it was pretty gut wrenching really we thought wed done enough to hold onto the victory and to see that dropped goal go over at the last minute was really disappointing
3487042 were confident in our ability and we know if we cut down our errors we will get ourselves on the right foot eventually and put some victories on the table
3487043 theres no negativity around the camp and theres a good vibe in the team and were confident going into thursdays game
3487044 its massively important beating manawatu but we havent really talked about the importance of winning so much more about the importance of getting our game right and cutting out the mistakes
3487045 i think if we do that the rest should take care of itself
3487046 theyre a very abrasive sort of team they like to set really strong contact and take you on all over the field
3487047 they send to play whats in front of them and were aware of that so weve got to keep our eyes up on defence and get our blitz formation working well
3487048 and im really enjoying the coaching staff weve got here with tony hanks scott mcleod and gibbesy jono gibbes so its very enjoyable on that side of things
3487049 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3487050 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3487051 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them

3487110 the visibility was extremely poor with patchy fog so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on our navigation activities
3487111 shortly after dark the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported light bearing on the starboard bow
3487112 the captain called out is it steady or moving astern
3487113 the lookout replied steady captain which meant that we were on a collision course with that source of light

3487132 this sterling achievement has overcome the numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilize our peace and stability and thus create confusion in our country in short the zimbabwe defence forces have demonstrated unparalleled patriotism and professionalism in the way they have carried out their constitutional role of defending our nation
3487133 in the face of the hyper inflationary environment obtaining in the country the government continues to cushion the defence forces by awarding them regular cost of living adjustments
3487134 i would also like to register the countrys appreciation of the reserve bank of zimbabwes move to provide 21 vehicles to army doctors under the zimbabwe health service retention scheme the zimbabwe defence forces have also received substantial financial support from the reserve bank which enables them to procure blankets mattresses and vehicle tyres among other things

3487167 hope is that we may reach the day when we no longer need to use embryonic stem cells as the foundation of this particular line of research where we can move to the more recent advances and take away the tough decisions about life versus science

3487193 seeing really is believing and is the reason why we compiled all of this great physx content into a free download for our end users
3487194 we want geforce owners to experience for themselves these amazing effects to get an idea how physx will make games much more lifelike in the years to come physics accelerated content is already here and there are a ton more titles on the way we cant wait for our customers to jump in get wet and tell us what they think

3487286 the police intention remains to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved these efforts are still ongoing
3487287 in both our annual report and our recent first quarter results we mentioned that there would be the opportunity for accretive acquisitions during the coming year the recent difficulties experienced by semcanada and ceg have provided us with one of these opportunities
3487288 this purchase fits with our strategy in two ways first in addition to residential customers the ceg customers fit the profile of the stable but targeted larger commercial customers we have accumulated across all of our other markets second we immediately enhance our strategic position in the b c commercial and residential markets where we are already currently active this transaction while not large is immediately accretive to our unitholders
3487289 i am pleased that we are able to offer continuity of fixed price supply to these customers the ccaa filings by semcanada and ceg left many of them in a position where advantageously priced contracts would have been cancelled unless taken up by another supplier we have agreed to honor the obligation to supply these contracts and we hope that this will aid us in renewing these customers at the end of their term this transaction underscores the importance of committing to long term supply with proven creditworthy suppliers like energy savings
3487290 small businesses that are going to be liable for a lot of income tax are likely to use other tax forms so they only pay individual income taxes

3487298 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3487299 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3487300 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3487301 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3487302 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3487303 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3487304 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3487305 sesungguhnya allah tidak mengampuni dosa orang yang menyekutukan dia dengan sesuatu dan mengampuni dosa dosa lainnya bagi yang dia kehendaki
3487306 dan jika kamu tanyakan kepada mereka tentang yang mereka lakukan itu tentulah mereka akan menjawab
3487307 apakah dengan allah ayat ayatnya dan rasulnya kamu selalu berolok olok
3487308 dan barangsiapa diantara kamu mengambil mereka yahudi dan nasrani menjadi pemimpin maka sesungguhnya orang itu termasuk ke dalam golongan mereka sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang zalim

3487343 it was built for me and its sort of like open faced synthesizer i can play it with my hands and depending on what im feeling or thinking as well as the moisture in my hands or in the room i can manipulate oscillators to make sounds
3487344 i can also sample live things going on in the performance space its a very tactile instrument
3487345 im interested in this project that connects me to people and i do feel that when im performing im being social in a way
3487346 and when i started playing open mics i found that i was able to connect in a new way as part of a cultural scene
3487347 thats why i like lo fi venues and houses its as if there arent really performers or an audience but instead its like everybody is creating a scene
3487348 i have a lot of elements to my music i record live and dont overdub so i may run through multiple amplifiers i try to keep things as natural as possible which occasionally mean abrupt entrances and endings
3487349 if a sound naturally trails off then thats what youll hear on record
3487350 if it drops off then youll hear that as well
3487351 i think there are different ways of entering into things there is a lot of improvised music that is inaccessible for different reasons unless you have a continuous relationship with it and it can be sometimes hard to understand the niche it can be so esoteric sometimes but when you play for such a diverse audience a gallery a university and a house with some punk kids you probably become trained to understand that diversity
3487352 i dont really listen to the music i get billed with i listen to african music and folk music and lots of other music i just make music i want to hear and others would too
3487353 okay let me rephrase that statement i dont like him for you
3487354 what about your last boyfriend mr m he still loves you and wants another chance
3487355 i dont love him the way i love b boy
3487356 i know his type stughetto he wont settle down i think he likes the idea more than the reality
3487357 thats an unfair assumption because you dont even know him
3487358 i know enough that man will break your heart eventually
3487359 no not yet im afraid he might not want me to keep it
3487360 so what if he doesnt want you to keep it
3487361 i know but slishy i dont think i could have a baby for a man who didnt want it
3487362 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3487363 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3487364 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3487365 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3487366 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3487367 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3487379 at the time of the conduct alleged in the amended complaint the individual federal defendants were each acting within the scope of their employment as employees of the united states
3487380 the requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter
3487381 address questions pertaining to our jurisdiction before 7 proceeding to the merits
3487382 excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch
3487383 u nless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar we may not dismiss the claims as nonjusticiable under the political 8 question doctrine
3487384 decision making in the fields of foreign policy and national security is textually committed to the political branches of government
3487385 special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress
3487386 the judiciary to decline to exercise its discretion in favor of creating damages remedies against federal officials
3487387 recognized two more nonstatutory damages remedies the first for employment discrimination in violation of the due process clause davis v passman 442 u s 228 1979 and the second for an eighth amendment violation by prison officials carlson v green 446 u s 14 1980
3487388 in most instances the court has found a bivens remedy unjustified
3487389 more recent decisions the supreme court has responded cautiously to suggestions that bivens remedies be extended into new contexts
3487390 an elaborate remedial system that ha d been constructed step by step with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations
3487391 not concern the merits 10 of the particular remedy that was sought
3487392 relate s to the question of who should decide whether such a remedy should be provided
3487393 c onvinced that congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served
3487394 exactly as in bush congress ha d failed to provide for complete relief respondents ha d not been given a remedy in damages for emotional distress or for other hardships suffered because of delays in their receipt of social security benefits
3487395 t he absence of statutory relief for a constitutional violation does not by any means necessarily imply that courts should award money damages against the officers responsible for the violation
3487396 the concept of special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress include s an appropriate judicial deference to indications that congressional inaction has not been inadvertent
3487397 w hen the design of a government program suggests that congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration
3487398 congress is the body charged with making the inevitable compromises required in the design of a massive and complex welfare benefits program
3487399 that congress expected the judiciary to stay its bivens hand
3487400 come better if at all through legislation because congress is in a far better position than a court to evaluate the impact of a new species of litigation against those who act on the publics behalf
3487401 point is not to deny that government employees sometimes overreach for of course they do and they may have done so here if all the allegations are true
3487402 t he point is the reasonable fear that a general bivens cure would be worse than the disease
3487403 tailor any remedy to the problem perceived thus lessening the risk of raising a tide of suits threatening legitimate initiative on the part of the governments employees
3487404 what other means there may be to vindicate a protected interest
3487405 ma king clear that it is the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme involved not the adequacy of specific remedies extended thereunder that counsels judicial abstention
3487406 courts must withhold their power to fashion damages remedies when 12 congress has put in place a comprehensive system to administer public rights has not inadvertently omitted damages remedies for certain claimants and has not plainly expressed an intention that the courts preserve bivens remedies
3487407 i n these circumstances it is not for the judiciary to question whether congress response was the best response for congress is the body charged with making the inevitable compromises required in the design of a massive and complex
3487408 authorizes civil suits by individuals whose privacy act rights are infringed
3487409 retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number symbol or other identifying particular assigned to the individual
3487410 there is every indication from the legislative history that the drafters of the privacy act in choosing to apply the foia definition of agency to the privacy act were cognizant of the conference committee report prepared in connection with the 1974 foia amendments which specifically provided that the term agency is not to be interpreted as including the presidents immediate personal staff or units in the executive office whose sole function is to advise and assist the president
3487411 when defendants demonstrate special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress
3487412 when defendants show that congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the constitution and viewed as equally effective
3487413 the decision whether to recognize a bivens remedy may require two steps
3487414 a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages
3487415 make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common law tribunal paying particular heed however to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation
3487416 there are available no other alternative forms of judicial relief
3487417 for people in bivens shoes it is damages or nothing
3487418 the question of who should decide whether such a remedy should be provided
3487419 congress has put in place a comprehensive system to administer public rights has not inadvertently omitted damages remedies for certain claimants and has not plainly expressed an intention that the courts preserve bivens remedies
3487420 weighing of reasons for and against the creation of a new cause of action the way common law judges have always done
3487421 brought by an acknowledged though covert employee of the cia
3487422 e ven a small chance that some court will order disclosure of a sources identity could well impair intelligence gathering and cause sources to
3487423 impaired her ability to carry out her duties at the cia
3487424 t he state secrets 20 privilege and the more frequent use of in camera judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection the court found necessary in enunciating the totten rule
3487425 at the time of the conduct alleged in the amended complaint the individual defendants were acting within the scope of their employment as employees of the united states
3487426 t he test for scope of employment is an objective one based on all the facts and circumstances
3487427 although scope of employment is generally a question for the jury it becomes a question of law for the court however if there is not sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the action was within the scope of the employment
3487428 t his argument rests on a misunderstanding of d c scope of employment law not to mention the plain text of the westfall act which directs courts to look beyond alleged intentional torts themselves
3487429 is broad enough to embrace any intentional tort arising out of a dispute that was originally undertaken on the employers behalf
3487430 a reasonable juror could find that a laundromat employee acted within scope of employment when he shot a customer during a dispute over missing shirts
3487431 jury reasonably found that a mattress deliveryman acted within the scope of employment when he assaulted and raped a customer following a delivery related dispute
3487432 the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants was a central part of the employees duties as military officers charged with winning the war on terror
3487433 the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants was the type of conduct the defendants were employed to engage in
3487434 alleged tortious conduct was incidental to the defendants legitimate employment duties
3487435 allegations of serious criminality d id not alter 23 our conclusion that the defendants conduct was incidental to authorized conduct
3487436 s peaking to the press during regular work hours in response to a reporters inquiry falls within the scope of a congressmans authorized duties
3487437 ability to do his job as a legislator effectively is tied as in this case to the members relationship with the public and in particular his constituents and colleagues in the congress
3487438 actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve the master

3487457 our intent was to put them into a dilemma where they could either come out and fight like men or run away and yield a position of significance while losing face among both the taliban and the locals
3487458 on the first day we went in with the commandos some of the taliban fought and some ran away but it didnt take long for all of them to leave town the entire operation was a huge slap in the face to the taliban
3487459 we wanted to gauge the talibans fighting abilities their weapons systems and their chain of command effectiveness within the zeriko valley
3487460 their failure to defend themselves only proved how inferior they really are as fighters
3487461 we have people from the zeriko coming to talk to the commando leadership to thank the government for going into the valley
3487462 they are extremely happy that the commandos got rid of the tyranny theyve been living with
3487463 the operation was a testament to their hard work and dedication to this country we couldnt have reached this level of effectiveness without the combined joint task task force eagle air assets landing us right on top of the taliban the element of surprise took the wind out of their sails before the fight even started
3487464 the taliban can go anywhere in this country and attempt to establish a sanctuary and well be one step behind to drive them out
3487465 there will be no safe haven for taliban fighters in this country you can be sure of that

3487496 we need to find 3 million more barrels of oil per day eighty five percent of our oil is located in the continental shelf and it is off limits the reason why that reserve is forbidden is its considered to be an environmental issue and america is not the only country to operate this way
3487497 drilling on american soil would reduce the demand for oil
3487498 the strength of the dollar depends on the price of oil if the price of oil is high the strength of the dollar is weakened

3487517 the people ive spoken with their views of the crop are certainly dramatically different than what these yields today say and what the conditions say theyre much more cautious and much more conservative

3487520 obviously the usda has confirmed how nice the crop looks but in the final analysis we dont think the net yields can be that high

3487551 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3487552 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3487553 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3487554 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3487555 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3487556 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated

3487644 we have received an amazing amount of support from all over our nation for the wounded warrior workplace initiative democrats republicans and independents have made the straniere pledge this is a non partisan effort and the nationwide movement continues to spread every day
3487645 these brave men and women gave their best and now it is our time to return what we can to them and their families
3487646 being a veteran myself i feel we need to do everything we can to support our wounded soldiers
3487647 support for our nations veterans and active duty troops has been a paramount issue in my campaign so i salute bob stranieres initiative and gladly commit to implementing the pledge with regard to my congressional staff if the voters send me to d c
3487648 being someone who has had family in the military i support this initiative because the veterans are the ones who keep us being free
3487649 without question i support this great initiative and i have already hired a veteran on my staff
3487650 employers often find it difficult understanding how military experience translates into real world experience things like leadership loyalty perseverance and duty are often overlooked this pledge means more than just hiring wounded heroes its an initiative to educate employers about the benefits of hiring veterans
3487651 i understand what our veterans go through because i am a decorated iraq war veteran living and working with a disability thats why im proud to make this pledge
3487652 as a veteran i believe we should do everything possible to support all of our veterans
3487653 we can sleep safely at night thanks to what these brave men and women have done for our country
3487654 this initiative is a commendable effort to bring attention to veterans and their families
3487655 i greatly support the initiative and i have already employed veterans for my staff
3487656 i think this is an awesome idea and a great plan i fully support the initiative
3487657 bob straniere shows both leadership and compassion in his outspoken support of the wounded warrior workplace initiative this demonstrates his willingness to take action and not just issue feel good press releases bravo for bob
3487658 i can only hope the members of our congress will follow his lead
3487659 as a vietnam era veteran i take great pride in the actions taken by bob straniere bobs wounded warrior workplace initiative is exactly what i would expect from a fellow veteran and patriot our nation needs leaders like bob straniere leader that are willing to stand up for those who would sacrifice life and limb so that others can continue to enjoy the freedom and privileges our great nation provides

3487666 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3487667 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3487668 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california

3487670 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting

3487961 baloney do our computer pundits lack all common sense the truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper no cd rom can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works
3487962 lacking editors reviewers or critics the internet has become a wasteland
3487963 then theres cyberbusiness were promised instant catalog shopping just point and click for great deals well order airline tickets over the network make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts stores will become obselete so how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire internet handles in a month even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the internet which there isnt the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism salespeople
3487964 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
3487965 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time

3487970 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
3487971 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3487972 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3487973 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3487974 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3487975 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3487976 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3487977 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3487978 the presidents of the european court human rights have granted interim relief to gary mckinnon for a period of two weeks until 28 august 2008 for the application to be heard before the full chamber
3487979 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3487980 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3487981 the departures coupled with spring layoffs have left a significant dent in the firms headcount and sparked public talk of efforts to seal a speedy merger
3487982 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3487983 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3487984 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3487985 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3487986 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3487987 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3487988 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3487989 the only request they made is that they are vegetarians
3487990 they said they had never seen a store like this
3487991 as we indicated when we received the correspondence from the state planning appeals board dated may 27 we have made our response in the timeframe they requested
3487992 in this comprehensive submission we addressed each of the issues raised by the board and reiterated the sound arguments for the development in the centre of the designated gateway city
3487993 we now look forward to a positive decision from an bord plean la on the planning appeals
3487994 we effectively collaborated with the union in being able to restore several key full time positions and bringing back many valued classified employees with benefits
3487995 because of the cooperation and willingness to work together we can now look forward to the opening of the school year
3487996 students in the district will not be getting all the support they need this upcoming school year
3487997 this district is overcrowded understaffed and many programs have disappeared we may not be losing teachers or some of the other staff but this district is not meeting the needs of its students
3487998 ensure all our records are 100 per cent accurate and we have advised the civil aviation safety authority
3487999 we want to make sure that all maintenance documentation is all ok
3488000 since the passage of the housing bill we have been contacted by families industry groups and individuals voicing concern about the long term impact of this ban on themselves and their communities
3488001 when the bill passed we pledged to continue to fight for these programs and dpagroundswell org is an important tool that will enable us to harness the swell of industry dissent against the ban by empowering individuals at all levels to influence public policy decisions we encourage everyone to visit the site find out how to get involved
3488002 more than 75 000 letters have already been generated through this campaign
3488003 we expect to top 250 000 individual actions in the next 50 days all helping us to save and reform sf dpa for the millions of potential homebuyers who need this important program in addition to the industry members who rely upon this assistance to help candidates worthy of homeownership
3488004 we are not ending our fight for downpayment assistance or for the hopes of working class families everywhere seeking to be homebuyers we are going to redouble our efforts
3488005 this provision of the housing bill was buried to the majority of the american people in the panic over the potential failure of large institutions so dpa got left behind in the discussion
3488006 but now is the morning after so we are going to speak far and wide across the united states in every city and town that we can touch letting people know how this is going to impact not only the working families that we serve but the community organizations governmental organizations and the local real estate communities who depend on downpayment assistance in order to put families into single family homeownership
3488007 we will work to make that change happen sooner rather than later
3488008 we were the last remaining safety net the collateral damage to local communities across the country is only now beginning to be calculated new data is coming out including recent statistics on how many communities rely on dpa for homeownership
3488009 were not going away we have spent our entire career confounding the expectations of those who would think that we are not able to defend ourselves
3488010 rather than work with us to determine how to improve a downpayment assistance program that has helped more than one million american families
3488011 when people understand the ramifications of what is going on today they will be outraged
3488012 they are very concerned about the impact thats going to have for first time home buyers
3488013 we tried to fight the good fight as long as we could but we couldnt see sacrificing the greater good for one provision
3488014 there were many factors that contributed to the situation were in now
3488015 we dont feel that dpas were such a primary contributing factor in the decline in housing that they should be eliminated
3488016 we have closed 50 percent of our homes under this program its been a big tool for a lot of us to get some of this inventory moved
3488017 its so easy to walk away if you never put any money down

3488036 if the legislation holds i believe we can expect two developments first there will be heightened activity in the period up to october 1st as affected homebuyers seek to lock into homes before they get sidelined and arent able to second we will see an appreciable decline in buyer activity and home sales as a result of down payment assistances elimination after october 1st buyers who could have purchased homes will have to wait or give up their search
3488037 were going to have 156 pga tour players going around talking about how great this golf course is and thats going to help us down the road
3488038 so a lot of the guys just love this donald ross design and i think that thats going to add to our tournament its going to improve our tournament over the years especially
3488039 a few weeks ago we cut the city work schedule from five days to four days hours from 40 to 32
3488040 thats at least why our full time officer is no longer here
3488041 the city hasnt received the proceeds that are necessary to keep going and thats the real reason for the work week reduction
3488042 were in the natural gas sales business so we dont have a lot of money going into the city especially this time of the year
3488043 the reduced work week has had nothing to do with problems with the state
3488044 were resolving the deficiencies outlined with the state and i am working with the people in benavides that are involved in getting their homes fixed
3488045 people here are concerned about the housing thing but i want to say that we just caught in the same situation that the county got caught in and it took them the state a long time to monitor if theyd done the monitoring two years earlier itd all been avoided
3488046 sheriff barrera and the sheriff elect romeo ramirez are aware of the situation
3488047 its minor like maybe a bench being overturned or a theft at a store
3488048 just stuff like that nothing serious goes on here like it does in other towns
3488049 theres been five bad accidents during the past 10 years
3488050 well have officers hired in september and everything will be fine

3488052 the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
3488053 everything on the huffington post is linked and attributed when i read that paragraph i thought rosen was talking apples to oranges
3488054 the fight currently ongoing between major newspapers and the ap over what the businessmen like to call repackaging content and what other people call stealing
3488055 i subscribe to new york observer reporter tom scoccas definition of plagiarism
3488056 and that is in short form what does this guy have that that guy didnt have already see how i didnt plagiarize there by giving tom his due credit
3488057 theres no way i could wake up every morning and find all of that myself that quickly
3488058 well i dont have too much to say on the subject
3488059 you see plagiarism of ideas without credit all the time in internetland on a daily basis
3488060 its an easy thing to commit too particularly when youre writing a blog and youre tasked with producing a certain amount of what they call content
3488061 right now what i see a lot of is people linking less and less prominently to their source material sometimes its just tiredness and distractedness lord knows i know but its bad for the internet and its bad for all of us
3488062 why cant we have an internet where stories and sources are linked and even named prominently
3488063 i link to things in my column that i get from all over
3488064 theres a huge and obvious difference between fair use blockquoting some text and giving a link and a name credit and unethical reprinting
3488065 this is common practice in newspapers from not only a hundred years ago
3488066 what site lead or managing editor of a website has time to send out a memo saying this is how we attribute stories and this is the theory behind it and its a good thing few if any
3488067 pretty much as things stand now everyone feels bad in one way or another and everyone actually does have a reason to feel bad
3488068 were not certain but best guess is an over owned group trading at peak multiples until yesterday colliding with the commodities sell off with the implication being lower future rail volume and pricing growth on the back of lower prices for coal grain etc
3488069 however in our view there is no short term link and the longer term correlation is tenuous
3488070 the price of rail transportation is driven by the demand and supply of capacity not the price of the underlying commodity
3488071 falling oil should also mitigate any negative impact of falling commodity prices delivering a net eps benefit near term

3488082 if violence is allowed to continue against pad supporters without any action being taken it wont bode well for the governments image
3488083 the government may hope that the violence would deter pad protests which are in fact in accordance with the constitution but in fact it will threaten the governments stability
3488084 the pad is calling on army chief gen anupong paojinda as isoc director to show responsibility rather than staying aloof if he allows the situation to drift further bloodshed will result and national security will be threatened
3488085 those who are mistreated will rise up in arms and it is about time
3488086 if you claim to have no power over the issue just quit so you can stay home and be as powerless as you want if the military does nothing there will be bloodshed
3488087 i will fight against them coming here if they show up here 10 times we will meet each other 10 times
3488088 when we were asked to donate our spunmelt materials for the surgical gowns being worn as part of the medical response for the games in beijing this summer the company and our local employees were pleased to help support this important effort along with daikin chemicals and kunshan jiehong
3488089 more importantly the use of these surgical gowns by the beijing emergency medical center will demonstrate first hand in the field the high level of protection these materials provide
3488090 the medical team in china will experience the same high quality level of gowns used in hospitals in the u s europe and elsewhere around the globe this will encourage further adoption and use of medical nonwovens in asia which will benefit healthcare professionals patients and the public

3488141 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3488142 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey

3488165 all of us have taken it upon ourselves to get better this summer
3488166 in the past we have come back in the summer but in the four years i have never had a team work out this hard and with this many people during the summer
3488167 we want a different outcome from the season we had last year
3488168 our record of 26 36 didnt show what we were capable of
3488169 i think we know we are one of the top teams in the conference
3488170 i just think we need to get over that hump and believe we can win the wac
3488171 i believe another reason we are here is to start growing together
3488172 we know how to play and we have shown that we can play with elite competition

3488180 most of the team who are not here play on summer teams
3488181 our chemistry was not bad last season but there is always room for improvement
3488182 i just feel that we cant afford to get behind

3488239 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3488240 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3488241 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3488242 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here

3488260 in my opinion these are not essential to their survival
3488261 the lifting of long standing fuel subsidies by the government in february 2008 has certainly worsened inflation
3488262 this increase helped the poorest of the poor subsisting in precarious living conditions but for those who are not at that level this change had little impact in reversing the government salary cuts of 1993 which in real terms is a 70 percent cut after the devaluation of the cfa franc west african currency in 1994

3488378 webbs breakthrough ideas show how marketing selling and servicing functions can be approached as a process with input and outputs causes and effects i highly recommend this book to all senior executives whether they are aiming for better forecasting better market share higher margins or reduced cost of sales it will completely change the way you view sales and marketing and help you get a handle on sales process improvement
3488379 hats off to mike webb for tackling this challenging subject improving sales and marketing is like training your cat to come when you call it its an interesting thing to think about but full of pitfalls to the uninitiated mike however is very initiated and this book does a good job of showing you how quantitative methods can apply to a traditionally hard to manage business its not that sales forces dont have metrics you could argue that they have the ultimate metric did we make the sale like your cat these groups seem to have a mind of their own and the cause and effect of the activities that go into making the sale arent usually methodically examined and improved mike shows you how to do that with style
3488380 think about it marketing and sales can easily represent nearly half of your companys annual expenses this expense is far from being optimized when 9 out 10 leads are typically discarded early in the sales cycle companies that do not apply a systematic and truly accountable approach to blending marketing and sales will undoubtedly struggle to survive in this increasingly competitive business climate this book concisely applies practical six sigma methods to help companies boost customer value and realize greater roi out of their marketing and sales investment if you know theres room for improvement between your marketing and sales teams i highly recommend you leverage this book as a key competitive advantage
3488381 this book is essential reading for anyone in sales and marketing mike webbs unique perspective is captured in this excellent roadmap on how to organize measure and lead both marketers and sellers to greater success
3488382 michael webb has once again demonstrated his clear and systematic thinking about delivering value to customers in this must read book sales and marketing the six sigma way in this book mike provides tools to help measure your sales processes in terms important to your customers then you can continuously improve your processes of finding winning and keeping customers
3488383 sales and marketing organizations have historically been slow in adopting the benefits of six sigma for a variety of reasons especially because of the effort required to
3488384 michael webb has a very incisive clear headed approach to untangling complex sales problems sales and marketing the six sigma way breaks the sales funnel into its component parts and systematically identifies bottlenecks and disconnects that waste your time and resources selling might have been done by the seat of the pants in the 20th century but that isnt going to work now those who miss this shift will find themselves further and further behind quotas and locked in a corporate pressure cooker but those who recognize and act will discover that the current business climate can be enormously rewarding and profitable this book is not a sales rah rah session it takes enormously successful methods from manufacturing and applies them to the toughest job in your company getting orders from customers i wholeheartedly recommend michael and his innovative methods
3488385 michael webb brings true understanding to sales and marketing through process thinking if you want a harmonious relationship between sales marketing and customer service that will drive customer value you need to read this book
3488386 if you dont know what you have done to succeed or what has caused you to fail you are leaving your destiny to chance in our experience when you understand and remove obstacles to your customers achieving their objectives you create customer value by helping them succeed in addition putting your own processes under the microscope can reveal the whats inhibiting you from achieving your sales goals michael webbs straightforward approach to sales and marketing using the popular six sigma method is presented with a sense of humor and lots of examples well worth your time
3488387 if more books on the subject were as concise and fun to read as sales and marketing the six sigma way the business world would be a better place the book will provide sales and marketing executives with money making tools they can use daily
3488388 applying six sigma to sales and marketing initially i was skeptical but after reading this book im a believer applying these principles correctly will help sales managers solve many of the challenges they face every day in their quest to improve sales performance
3488389 it isnt often that i can recommend a six sigma book because reducing defects tends to be product focused and internally oriented this book is not only different but better than any other six sigma book ive ever seen because it actually shows how to use it to increase the value of your relationships and experiences with your customers this is the way six sigma should be done
3488390 the name of the game is not to design the sales process around ourselves but to create customer value sales and marketing the six sigma way is relevant to all executives who are looking to deliver maximum results internally and externally

3488408 youd put on isaac hayes and follow it with barry white and it was a special evening
3488409 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to befriend in this life he was an incredible friend my heart goes out to his wife and children

3488453 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3488454 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3488455 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3488456 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3488457 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3488458 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3488459 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3488460 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3488461 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today

3488487 many persons worry about becoming narrow minded before they have learned to be balanced superficial seekers in their wish to appear broad minded indiscriminately absorb differing ideas without first distilling the essence of truth within them by realization the result is a spiritually weak diluted consciousness though i regard lovingly all true religious paths and all true spiritual teachers you see that i am one pointedly loyal to my own
3488488 all true religions lead to god seek until you find the spiritual teaching which draws and fully satisfies your own heart and once having found it let nothing touch your loyalty again give the path your full attention put your entire consciousness upon it and you will find the results you are seeking
3488489 so im writing this for the aba wonder if ill get to go this time last time the meeting was in latrobe this time its in st meinrad thats closer should be able to drive down its the 50th anniversary want to support fr eugene hes worked hard on this
3488490 daily then let each take account with himself of the days and the nights doings and if he has sinned let him cease and if he has not let him not boast but abide in the good and not grow careless nor judge his neighbor nor justify himself
3488491 for a safeguard against sinning use this manner of observing let us each note and write down our deeds and the movements of the soul as if to tell them to each other and be sure that from utter shame of being known we shall cease from sinning and even from thinking over anything bad for who likes to be seen when he is sinning or having sinned does not rather lie wishing to hide it
3488492 just as we should do no foulness in sight of each other so if we write our thoughts as if telling them to each other we shall better guard ourselves from foul thoughts for shame of being known let the written tale be to us instead of the eyes of our fellow monks that shamed as much at writing as being seen we may not even think evil and molding ourselves in this way we shall be able to master the body to please god and to trample on the snares of the enemy

3488495 unceasing prayer is the most important aspect of the carmelite rule
3488496 can say jesus is lord except in the holy spirit
3488497 the paraclete the holy spirit whom the father will give in my name will instruct you in everything reminding you of all that i have told you
3488498 god i thank you that i am not like other people grasping crooked adulterous or even like this tax collector i fast twice a week i give a tenth of all my income
3488499 i tell you this man went down to his home justified rather than the other for all who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves will be exalted
3488500 if this is so then you can not be so sad but be happy and he chuckled
3488501 meg funk its just you and me here now tell me you are so smart do you really believe there is a god
3488502 meg i get how you feel as christian you have your team with color chants social set its comforting to belong and have a sense of identity
3488503 meg is god what i experience when is sit down to write and it simply rises
3488504 it is because of our disdain and negligence that god sends us these trials not to beat us down but to raise us up again we mourn for our sins prostrate weep and moan lord send me a thunderbolt for when i am well disobey you
3488505 it is folly for one who has a dead person in his house to leave him there and go to weep over his neighbors dead
3488506 on seeing an actress the loss of this woman and the other that i am not so concerned to please god as she is to please wicked men
3488507 if you are silent wherever you are you will find rest that is the satisfaction of your spiritual desires
3488508 spiritual sensitivity is impassability of an intelligent being a gift of god the spiritual senses quicken to the extent that the lower senses are deadened
3488509 my most usual method is this simple attention an affectionate regard for god to whom i find myself often attached with greater sweetness and delight than that of an infant at the mothers breast to choose an expression i would call this state the bosom of god for the inexpressible sweetness which i taste and experience there
3488510 sit in your cell and it will teach you all things
3488511 lord grant that i may see you with a pure heart whereas before wrapped in my own darkness i did not even know you
3488512 whosoever perseveres in his love of thee o solitary cell dwells indeed in thee but god dwells in him
3488513 a reflection of the eternal light and a spotless mirror of the doings of god the image of gods excellence
3488514 cold amoral world governed only by chance and by the selfish actions of human persons engaged in the cruel quest for pleasure
3488515 my own acceptance of the existence of god rested on something more like an intuition
3488516 in the beginning when god created the heavens and the earth the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep while a wind from god swept over the face of the waters then god said let there be light and there was light
3488517 look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them and recognize that god did not make them out of things that existed and in the same way the human race came into being
3488518 the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being
3488519 a wind from god swept over the face of the waters
3488520 these all look to you to give them their food in due season when you send forth your spirit they are created and you renew the face of the earth
3488521 to a vague commitment about the dependence of the world upon god simply moves the matter to a higher level of abstraction
3488522 was usually accepted because of a particular reading of genesis 1
3488523 god saw everything that he had made and indeed it was very good
3488524 i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god
3488525 one of the most constant themes in the spiritual teaching of the worlds religious traditions is that human beings ought not to cling to possessions of one sort or another and that things will in fact normally be much more appreciated and enjoyed if one does not cling to them or yearn for them to have a permanence that is not appropriate
3488526 god wishes to be known and it pleases him that we should rest in him for everything which is beneath him is not sufficient for us
3488527 in antiquity every tree every spring every stream every hill had its own genius loci its guardian spirit before one cut a tree mined a mountain or dammed a brook it was important to placate the spirit in charge of that particular situation and to keep it placated
3488528 fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth
3488529 blazing spirit fire personal super substantial be pleased yet once again to come down and breathe a soul into the newly formed fragile film of matter with which this day the world is to be freshly clothed
3488530 if the holy spirit is poured out on the whole creation then the spirit creates the community of all created things with god and with each other making it that fellowship of creation in which all created things communicate with one another and with god each in its own way
3488531 ultimately this because of needs to be understood as a final cause that is as a telos
3488532 the utmost we can say about ultimate reality before admitting its ultimate ineffability is that for us the ultimate is like an infinitely compassionate father mother

3488534 never to keep silent ones own thoughts this confession is barely conceivable without tears or if it is done with no trace of feeling one can conclude that it is worth very little

3488541 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3488542 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad
3488543 we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
3488544 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security

3488578 transactions have become more challenging in recent months due to increased tenant vacancies at properties especially during escrow
3488579 we have provided effective solutions to accommodate both buyers and sellers on multiple transactions to successfully close each deal
3488580 the property is a unique mix of office medical and retail tenants that has historically been over 90 percent occupied
3488581 through our extensive marketing efforts we procured an all cash 1031 exchange buyer from california through a california agent
3488582 it was a challenging sale given the fact coffee bean amp tea leaf announced during escrow that they would not be opening their store at this location
3488583 we overcame that obstacle in addition to some other difficult deal points to successfully close escrow and achieve both the buyers and sellers investment goals even with the coffee bean amp tea leaf situation the buyer liked the strength of the location which was adjacent to uc riverside the closing cap rate of 5 68 percent represents a near record cap rate for similar type product in riverside county
3488584 the sale required a 60 percent down payment and the assumption of an existing loan
3488585 we overcame a tenant vacancy during escrow to help satisfy a 1033 exchange for the buyer and establish a record breaking cap rate for a multi tenant strip center in the area
3488586 despite an economic downturn and continued capital market challenges we continue to close deals in todays market

3488589 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3488590 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3488591 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3488592 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3488593 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3488594 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3488595 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3488596 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated

3488632 my friend and i ran upstairs and hid inside a large trunk and a vast suitcase in one of the bedrooms
3488633 peter and the nurse talked downstairs for what seemed like ages then i heard footsteps coming up the stairs peter said he thought her little black lacy pants with red flowers were saucy
3488634 then they went quiet and i imagine they were having sex instead of thinking about what peter was up to i concentrated on fleeing the house quickly
3488635 when i confronted him the next morning peter seemed impressed by my having caught him out

3488671 maxon has spent the last 20 years developing some of the industrys most advanced 3d software technologies continually raising the bar for 3d animation software excellence

3488680 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3488681 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3488682 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3488683 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine

3488697 its very much a designated 24 hour music channel to build on the success of what channel 4 has done over the last few years in music were gathering a lot of our music output and putting it in one place working very closely with joint venture partner box tv to hopefully offer a music channel like nothing else thats out there at the moment
3488698 the joint venture officially got announced last summer and since then weve been working to bring 4music to air we did a trial earlier this year where we took ten sunday nights on the hits and experimented with different pieces of our content and theirs for 4music sundays that was incredibly well received and then off the back of that the next natural step was to launch our own music channel
3488699 i suppose there are no other music channels out there at the moment that have access to the volume and quality of music programming that channel 4 does without wanting to name and shame if you look to some of the other channels the interpretation of what is music television has been broadened in a number of different directions if you look across the 4music schedule you see live from abbey road the album chart show and transmission through to projects like 4 music presents and live coverage of music events music is absolutely at the forefront of what were doing here if you look to other digital music channels they have occasional pieces of music programming but it feels very occasional
3488700 the conversations have been running concurrently e4 music will return in september and that was always our intention e4 music has a very distinct tone of voice it feels very e4 were not looking to replicate what weve done on e4 music with 4music although clearly theres going to be a certain amount of crossover on 4music the programming will not be curated and authored in the way that e4 music is by our presenting team we feel that theres a distinction between the two offerings
3488701 e4 music is currently commissioned from september until big brother begins in summer 2009 we would never take a decision further than that i think we just want to see how everything does going forward
3488702 on launch night weve got a big authored video countdown with two big channel 4 faces steve jones and davina mccall from 7pm til 9pm then weve got the world premiere of the new kylie concert recorded a couple of weeks ago at the o2 weve also got a big brother live programme which comes off the back of the main c4 show at 11 10pm davina will alert viewers to the fact that 4music has launched a couple of hours ago and then there will be a music based piece of output coming from the big brother house there is a music flavour to our involvement with big brother and this is the only bit of big brother programming you will see on the 4music channel something like the sunday night project is an entertainment and music piece they have a weekly band and a large number of the hosts have been musicians mark ronson geri halliwell boyzone kanye west so its a fit and presents an opportunity for us to revisit that programming
3488703 its important for us to be premiering and playing things exclusively on 4music in the first week we have transmission and the third series of ibiza rocks box tv is bringing the weekly hit 40 uk chart to the table and miquita oliver has a new series that will play monday nights at 8 also this weekend we have about 20 hours of live coverage from v festival exclusive to the 4music channel
3488704 not at the moment there are no firm plans at all a number of our other digital channels obviously do have one and were constantly looking at the portfolio of channels so where there are openings im sure we will seize upon them the 50 joint venture stake that channel 4 has in box tv covers all seven channels so thats a decision the board would look at
3488705 giving exact figures is not something were publicly looking to shout about but obviously the investment in content shows that were seriously committed and are looking to build on what weve achieved thankfully the hits is the number one digital music channel so for us its about retaining that position and building on its success
3488706 jeg tror faktisk at politikerne p det her omr de lader sig forf re af folkestemningen det er forkasteligt
3488707 hvis nogen siger at der ikke er nogen sammenh ng s er jeg bare ikke enig
3488708 sagen er fuldst ndig unik og kan ikke forebygges med h rdere straf det her burde handle om den sociale indsats
3488709 det er nok den del af samfundsvidenskaben vi ved mest om der foreligger et omfattende materiale om straf ogs internationalt
3488710 jeg tror ikke p den forskning konsekvens har alts en effekt det tror jeg p
3488711 let us discuss it with the other participants but i think i can say that its hard to imagine this would be fruitful at this time
3488712 today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you
3488713 were going to have a lot of new faces on offense our receiver core will not be household names but i still think we have some very talented young men that can help us our offensive line might be the biggest weve ever been
3488714 defensively weve got eight starters back technically but i think nine because those nine guys were in all our packages last year
3488715 special teams is a big question mark for us armando cuko takes over the kicking duties
3488716 all and all first day practices im kind of happy where we are again were young on offense but weve got liam coen under center and any time youve got liam under center youre going to have a chance to win thats just kind of the general feeling of where were at right now but i have a good feeling about this group i think wherever we are aug 30 against albany well be way better six weeks later this is an exciting group to coach
3488717 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hardworking patriotic americans who call hawaii home
3488718 for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother and for him and his family to bond and recharge in his home state hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
3488719 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do

3488733 while at amp t does not fundamentally oppose the transaction and believes competition benefits consumers the regulatory process must be consistent for all providers
3488734 we will continue to urge the and clearwire to the same competitive analysis standard under which it reviews all other carriers
3488735 transparent attempt to use the commissions spectrum screen to hamstring prospective competition to at amp t
3488736 claim before the commission that they really have only 55 5 mhz of useable spectrum for competitive evaluation purposes while simultaneously claiming before the investment community and the that their spectrum holdings will be at least three times that size
3488737 at amp t fails to point to a single competitive harm that would arise from the new clearwire transaction

3488747 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3488748 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3488752 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3488753 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3488754 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3488755 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3488761 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

3488804 pakistans inter services intelligence isi agency is a global curse the massive and callous july 7 blast outside the indian embassy in kabul has exposed pakistans hollowness and duplicity for orchestrating the nefarious act the government of india was well aware about isis deceitful maneuverings some months ago no less a person than afghanistan president hamid karzai had cautioned india about what was going to befall and mar indian interests in afghanistan his assessment has proved correct pakistan has exhibited its classic example of hate india relationship with gusto and this time in a foreign country

3488827 we want to use amplifi as a tool for information that will be used by all healthcare providers at uhs not just the pharmacy

3488829 with quantifi we want to improve the process for pharmacists to perform clinical interventions and we want to be able to drill down on them to identify opportunities for improvement in patient care
3488830 were looking at how we can use this tool system wide to improve therapies and identify problems
3488831 computers only cost as much as they do because the makers of the software primarily microsoft go to enormous lengths to make their products necessary and expensive
3488832 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3488833 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3488834 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3488835 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3488836 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3488837 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

3488839 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3488840 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3488841 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3488842 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3488843 entonces jehov dios form al hombre del polvo de la tierra y sopl en su nariz aliento de vida y fue el hombre un ser viviente

3488863 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3488864 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3488865 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3488866 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3488867 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3488868 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3488869 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3488870 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3488871 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3488872 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3488873 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3488874 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3488875 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3488876 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3488877 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3488878 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3488879 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3488880 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3488881 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3488882 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3488883 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3488884 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3488885 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3488886 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3488887 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3488888 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3488889 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3488890 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3488891 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3488892 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3488893 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3488894 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3488895 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3488896 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3488897 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3488898 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3488899 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3488900 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3488901 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3488902 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3488903 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3488904 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3488905 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3488906 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3488907 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3488908 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3488909 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3488910 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3488911 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3488912 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3488913 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3488914 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3488915 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

3488927 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3488963 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3488964 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3488965 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates

3489137 we havent seen that kind of activity in a very long time
3489138 not since the early 1990s it was quite impressive to see
3489139 i have made a decision to resume regular flights of russian strategic aviation
3489140 we proceed from the assumption that our partners will view the resumption of flights of russias strategic aviation with understanding
3489141 starting today such tours of duty would be conducted regularly and on the strategic scale
3489142 our pilots have been grounded for too long they are happy to start a new life
3489143 this is a significant change of posture of russian strategic forces
3489144 its a response to the relocation of nato forces closer to russias western border
3489145 we certainly are not in the kind of posture we were with what used to be the soviet union its a different era
3489146 if russia feels as though they want to take some of these old aircraft out of mothballs and get them flying again thats their decision
3489147 stability and security in central asia are best ensured primarily through efforts taken by the nations of the region on the basis of the existing regional associations

3489157 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
3489158 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things ive got 1 000 in bats but i love it

3489185 ive been out on the street witnessing for about three years now one on one and i cant say confidently that i have seen anyone saved ive seen so many cry and do all that but none of them have ever called me or written about how their new faith is going so the question is what do you do when you feel like youre not doing anything at all

3489189 therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord
3489190 however pavia says the books on both lists were postponed not permanently canceled
3489191 we obviously have restructured our publishing program and are going month by month with fewer titles
3489192 we are talking about either revising the schedule or looking at alternatives such as online publication
3489193 aber doch galt er als stilvoller mann der auch gro z gig sein konnte
3489194 the european digital library will be a quick and easy way for people to access european books and art whether in their home country or abroad it will for example enable a czech student to browse the british library without going to london or an irish art lover to get close to the mona lisa without queuing at the louvre
3489195 however even though member states have made significant progress in making cultural content accessible on the internet more public and private investment is needed to speed up digitisation my goal is to have a european digital library called europeana and rich in content open to the public before the end of the year
3489196 no you dont just get up you have to crack your eyes open and then realize you are late you didnt sleep well the night before you have to crawl out of bed and you have to make yourself something to eat before you do anything else because you have to take your vitamins and have energy for the day and if not you might as well give up on spoons for the whole day
3489197 christine how do you do it do you really do this everyday
3489198 i have learned to live life with an extra spoon in my pocket in reserve you need to always be prepared
3489199 dont worry i see this as a blessing i have been forced to think about everything i do do you know how many spoons people waste every day i dont have room to waste them and i choose to spend this time with you

3489207 due to the fact that i didnt have to write a proposal and to enumerate advanced technologies i would be using to make this piece i was completely free to make what i think is meaningful and beautiful the pressure to be up to date with technology appears insane to me it doesnt bring any more beauty or pleasure instead it creates things that are hard to understand and impossible to handle so nobody can actually experience them beyond reading the artists concept
3489208 hell be given one then hopefully through his attorney well be able to talk to him
3489209 i dont understand how anybody can hurt a child in any way especially this way

3489218 the campus was beautiful i didnt know the campus was that big when i usually go to st johns i go for practice the whole campus is great its big i was surprised

3489221 why do people mice and worlds die when they do
3489222 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3489223 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3489224 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3489225 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3489226 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3489227 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3489228 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3489229 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3489230 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3489231 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3489232 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3489233 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3489234 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3489235 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3489236 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3489237 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3489238 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3489239 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3489240 i guess im just an old mad scientist at bottom give me an underground laboratory half a dozen atom smashers and a beautiful girl in a diaphanous veil waiting to be turned into a chimpanzee and i care not who writes the nations laws

3489253 nei suoi primi 100 giorni di mandato silvio berlusconi potrebbe essere riuscito a fare limpossibile garantirsi il controllo di una nazione apparentemente ingovernabile a un livello senza precedenti nella recente storia italiana
3489254 e sorprendente che qualcuno in italia sia riuscito ad avere tanto successo
3489255 molto pi della maggior parte dei paesi europei litalia stata a lungo tormentata dalla corruzione e da un sistema che tributa un eccessivo peso politico ai partiti piccoli
3489256 uno dei suoi primi atti stato far approvare una legge che garantisce limmunit alle prime quattro cariche dello stato
3489257 che questa nuova legge rappresenti un possibile conflitto di interessi non e passato inosservato ma gli italiani si sentono troppo poveri per prestarvi grande attenzione
3489258 chiedono sicurezza economica e di altro genere e berlusconi la sta dando loro con pugno di ferro in un guanto di velluto
3489259 emblematica stata la sua capacit di ripulire napoli sepolta per mesi sotto limmondizia
3489260 ha affrontato la percezione di un aumento del crimine nonostante i dati dimostrino altrimenti e che la colpa sia degli stranieri
3489261 ora agli italiani piace ma cio che vogliono davvero la stabilit economica
3489262 da newsweek non giunge solo un elogio a tutto tondo dei primi cento giorni del governo berlusconi ma anche una lettura lucida di cosa e successo in italia in questi mesi tutte cose su cui il pd dovrebbe riflettere a mio avviso
3489263 il governo del centro destra ha fatto in 100 giorni cio che il governo prodi non avrebbe fatto in 100 anni
3489264 limmagine positiva del nostro paese in un contesto internazionale nel quale eravamo lontani
3489265 hello greetings and welcome from world headquarters its the big show
3489266 i want to ask the question whether religion may endanger a free society
3489267 we can and should deny the right of any individual to hold office who does not believe in god
3489268 and i will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you i will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
3489269 let me kissmy father and my mother and then i will follow you

3489274 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
3489275 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
3489276 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal
3489277 we want freedom and we will continue our struggle until we are free
3489278 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3489279 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation
3489280 nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3489281 the government of pakistan condemns the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3489282 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people
3489283 we call for immediate steps to end violence against innocent kashmiris
3489284 perch cos che ti frega la vita ti piglia quando hai ancora lanima addormentata e ti semina dentro unimmagine o un odore o un suono che poi non te lo togli pi e quella l era la felicit lo scopri dopo quando troppo tardi e sei gi per sempre un esule a migliaia di chilometri da quellimmagine da quel suono da quellodore alla deriva
3489285 do we have the right skills and capabilities to pull our strategy off
3489286 i worry that the current management team will not be able to take us where we need to go to next
3489287 at the end of the day we bet on people not strategies
3489288 i know of no safer depository of the ultimate powers than the people themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion
3489289 paving the road home the national behavioral health conference and policy academy on returning veterans and their families
3489290 this conference and policy academy is really designed overall to help states and territories and the district of columbia think about new approaches particularly approaches that blend expertise and resources from multiple contributors
3489291 its going to provide framework to consider different approaches dialogue with colleagues and work toward a unified plan that they can take to their states to ensure that veterans have the mental health services they need and want
3489292 whether were from the federal government whether from state or local government the research community or wherever you come from today look for ways that we can address the needs that those men and women return with
3489293 whether were from samhsa or the va or dod we each have a role to play in addressing those needs
3489294 weve come up with a center of centers concept because weve realized that none of us have all of the answers
3489295 we brought in four existing centers that have been doing great work for a long time
3489296 thats why i personally appreciate the expertise and counsel as you formulate better mental care policies particularly to reduce stigma
3489297 stigma is a huge component in the inability for servicemembers to effectively seek support and care
3489298 it doesnt matter how good your opportunities are how effective your integration of community and military and veterans affairs programs are if you dont open the door for participation in a way that men and women will walk through its not going to work
3489299 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
3489300 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
3489301 lin miaoke might be only 9 years old but she is well on her way to becoming a star thanks to her heartwarming performance
3489302 if youre not good looking no matter how well you sing youll not be onstage do you know youre twisting a whole generation
3489303 if foreigners found out theyd think we cant even find a girl who is good at both

3489314 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3489315 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3489316 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3489317 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3489318 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3489319 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3489320 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3489321 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3489322 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3489330 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3489331 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3489332 in the area where we live those children are 12 miles from school
3489333 thats a long walk what are they going to do
3489334 while school systems are working hard to limit programming cuts the sharp increase in costs will have a negative impact on children especially disadvantaged children unless the states and federal government act quickly to provide relief
3489335 we wouldnt do the four day school week if we had money
3489336 with the state budget the way it is theres just no hope right now
3489337 the mortgage crisis going on means there are fewer property owners fewer property taxes being paid
3489338 weve had layoffs before but never this many all at one time
3489339 its no different than what our own families are doing
3489340 were trying to decide how to enjoy ourselves the most for the least amount of dollars spent on fuel
3489341 we worked hard for roughly a year and a half so we could meet the challenges of an economic downturn
3489342 i wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to bob leeks family its so easy to criticize but we should recognize the great work of everyone who responded to this devastating event
3489343 i was within 10km of the incident and it was truly terrifying even from a safe distance
3489344 my heart goes out to the employee and firefighter killed in this accident it is fortunate that not more people got injured or killed
3489345 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3489346 the pinks are running and he had some luck using pixies

3489369 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3489370 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3489371 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3489372 why absolutely no transaction from the tag should be trusted
3489373 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3489374 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3489375 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3489376 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3489377 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3489385 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3489386 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3489387 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3489388 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3489389 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3489390 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3489391 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3489392 whats driving this is that a lot of our customers try to support the application on their own
3489393 and its an application just like oracle apps are applications it needs to change and alter with the company their processes change and it also needs to keep up with salesforce com updates
3489394 if they have a lot of stuff going on from different parties itll get more expensive
3489395 we have to educate people on the support side because salesforce com is so easy to alter and play with that a lot of companies take it on themselves
3489396 customers have a mentality of wanting one throat to choke
3489397 they want to talk to one person for their support and maybe that person then has to go to many other people for the answer
3489398 the flexibility of these solutions whether its microsoft crm or salesforce com is that even an educated power user can really get a project in trouble

3489441 it is clear not only from the language of the bill which must be read in the context of other related statutes to be clearly understood but also from the legislative history that there is absolutely no criminal immunity for anyone in these fisa amendments
3489442 during the january 24th 2008 debate in the senate senator brownback noted
3489443 would require acceptance by them of the fact that they had broken the law and thus be an admission of guilt
3489444 it would be an admission by bush too of his own criminal culpability which is why nixon refused to grant his aides a pardon
3489445 is have my justice department and my attorney general immediately review the information thats already there and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued i cant prejudge that because we dont have access to all the material right now
3489446 youre also right that i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems weve got to solve
3489447 now if i found out that there were high officials who knowingly consciously broke existing laws engaged in cover ups of those crimes with knowledge forefront then i think a basic principle of our constitution is nobody above the law and i think thats roughly how i would look at it
3489448 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing

3489479 my inner editor is of the tyrannical nit picking type who lies awake worrying if s he discovers a single typo in an email after it has been sent
3489480 fifty thousand words sounds like an awful lot at the beginning of the month but when id crossed the finish line on or about day seventeen i was a bit surprised not that the story was good or anything it was a terrible disjointed collection of vignettes with no cohesive plot and even after thirteen more days of work nothing really got resolved the characters were only an inch or so deep worse it was full of typos my inner editor is of the tyrannical nit picking type who lies awake worrying if s he discovers a single typo in an email after it has been sent horrors now theyll think im not perfect but it was a fun month having learned about the existence of the alphasmart in october i ordered two of them secondhand off ebay one for me one for my then 11 year old homeschooling daughter who had decided to write a novel for her english homework during november she paid for her own alphasmart with babysitting money these handy portable little word processors have turned out to be just as convenient and useful as people say they are during november i enjoyed carrying mine with me while grocery shopping visiting the doctor sitting through a childs music lesson mailing a parcel at the post office waiting time that had formerly dragged became vivid and productive when my novel was there to keep me company twenty minutes of standing in line at the post office for example more boring than the grocery store since the only literature within reach is of government issue seemed no time at all when i could hammer out the details of another chapter in my story by the way whoever designed our towns post office must have been sympathetic to the needs of novelists there is a railing with a broad flat wooden shelf just at elbow level running the length of the waiting area while others were using it only to rest their parcels on before mailing i found it to be a wonderful extended desktop for a keyboard every time the line moved up i just slid my parcel and my alphasmart along with me and kept typing possibly the three most interesting results of participation in nanowrimo were these for me 1 i get to tell everyone i wrote a novel which is of course why many of us participants do it in the first place 2 after winning i suddenly realized i had it in me to finish a novel id begun writing as a gift for my two older daughters several years ago it couldnt possibly be worse than my nanonovel i reasoned so i hauled it out and began typing again having transferred the last of novembers finished work into the computer to give me space to start afresh on my alphasmart nowadays thats what i work on while my younger kids are digging sand castles at the park 3 when april rolled around i was all ready to try my hand at a real play with scriptfrenzy the experience of participating in and winning nanowrimo had given me courage to venture even deeper into the world of writing for the theatre none of my previous plays had been longer than about twenty pages but hey anyone who can write 50 000 words of a novel can easily come up with 100 pages of a script right sure enough 108 pages and this time the story hung together and had a beginning a middle and an ending all i need now is an idea for nanowrimo 2008
3489481 the idea to have ozo host mornings for 98 7 was really born out of a wouldnt it be cool if conversation it just made complete sense based on the sound flow and compelling local content of the saturday night show and the spirit ozomatli has as a group we knew we had something special there they are not trying to be disc jockeys they are and relate to the 98 7 audience given their lifestyle and perspective on community music pop culture and politics 98 7 listeners are in for one heck of a morning show

3489517 said he and his colleagues plan to introduce legislation next year a sort of online privacy bill of rights that would require that consumers must opt in to the tracking of their online behavior and the collection and sharing of their personal data
3489518 until now the standard generally for data collection has been opt out opt out is optimal for companies because most people dont do it as we wrote on friday in july yahoo said that 75 000 users a fraction of one percent of the traffic it sees on its network visited an opt out page to refuse behaviorally targeted ads across the non yahoo sites on which yahoo serves ads the internet companies believe that that is because most people actually like targeted ads but it could also be that most people dont understand the kind of targeting thats going on because in surveys when they are asked about it they dont like being targeting

3489551 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3489552 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3489553 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3489554 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3489555 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3489556 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3489557 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3489558 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3489559 i always hide in the basement but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward

3489567 police harassment intimidation and violence against activists their supporters civilian witnesses and journalists both independent and mainstream reporting on contentious political activities continues unabated with abuse of anti terrorism and public order powers commonplace clearly the need to defend our civil liberties is greater than ever and it is up to people like me to do it through action at every level and not simply words todays ruling was a victory for common sense and sends out a clear message that the states relentless attempts to erode our human rights and liberties and to pervert the course of justice must and will be rigorously opposed and challenged otherwise we risk moving into police state territory
3489568 this has been a decisive victory for mr viesnik and i commend the judge for acting as he must

3489585 fifteen hundred red blooded americans just decided to apply to florida state
3489586 id probably be in law school actually trying to take drew rosenhaus job
3489587 thats what i wanted to do i wanted to be a sports agent first i wanted to be an attorney and then i decided i didnt want to argue with people for a living then i was like maybe if i was doing it for sports and it was something i was passionate about id feel differently
3489588 i did a weekly advice column for cnn si and then i started doing their road trips i was one of their pioneers in their web video
3489589 it was really cool going to visit different campuses was like going to college without the homework
3489590 im working on several projects now and a buddy of mine whos in the industry was like i really would like to have you in my movie
3489591 i was a buccaneers fan when they were the creamsicles

3489595 hell if they can find parking theyre happy its new york in general its not just jets fans i hope people take the time to check out the new entertainment that they bring in
3489596 im trying to become a little less southern a little less gentle and a little more jersey i guess you could say ill try my best
3489597 people up here always tell me im too nice so hopefully jets fans can make me a little stronger
3489598 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3489599 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3489600 so i dont know if its about the money either
3489601 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3489602 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on the rules keep it clean and stay on the subject or we may delete your comment if you see inappropriate language
3489603 we are excited to bring an indie inspired new intellectual property to the ea casual entertainment label with henry hatsworth that fuses together two styles of gameplay utilizing the two nintendo ds screens like never before
3489604 the innovative elements of the game have the potential to appeal to both nintendo enthusiasts and more casual nintendo ds players
3489605 its a deep challenging and humorous game that you wont want to put down
3489606 a left wing columnist and author who has plenty of money to travel on his own
3489607 those grants never should have been approved and the criteria should be tightened to prevent such abuses
3489608 i think its fair to say i love reggae music i always have
3489609 we found the event needed a bigger venue that would accommodate the kind of ideas we had for it tjapukai is great because there is enough space its still outdoors and the whole environment with the tropical rainforest backdrop makes it just like the dancehall venues of jamaica
3489610 by now if youre musically inclined youd possibly have conjured up images of an island in the caribbean probably jamaica and heaps of locals moving and grooving to the beats of reggae music
3489611 for me these images should be of somewhere much closer to home cairns and the far north reggae represents a lot of what we all love about the tropical north and why the region is one of this countrys major destinations for tourism
3489612 apart from the visual beauty we have a very laid back lifestyle here and people are pretty easy going
3489613 cairns is reggaetown the biggest festival of its kind in australia and it doesnt receive the recognition it deserves
3489614 i approached richard kingsmill the musical director of broadcaster triple j with the idea of having a dedicated reggae show on triple j instead of the music being played with roots and blues
3489615 it has a growing following in australia and the world and im convinced there is a market that is not being filled
3489616 we have been bringing big name reggae artists to the far north for many years such as third world alpha blondy lucky dube and jah mason and also support local and region artists who share the love of reggae music
3489617 we are satisfying the tastes for all styles of the genre and thats a good thing
3489618 i readily embraced it it had a warm friendly feel and that says a lot about what the music and its roots stand for
3489619 i was always curious as to why rastafarians used the star of david on their flag and many artworks and emblems
3489620 i discovered that according to ancient history ethiopias queen of sheba bore a son to king solomon of israel david
3489621 it may seem contentious to some but those pieces suddenly fit together and rastas many references to the lost tribes and 12 tribes of israel makes a lot of sense
3489622 reggae music has always had a very close link to the rastafarian culture and religion
3489623 ive just heard that chaka demus and pliers have agreed to play at reggaetown
3489624 we have what everyone wants the only reggae festival in australia in the best location
3489625 we should show that we love and understand the sentiments of reggae by coming out and showing what the great bob marley always preached one love
3489626 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3489627 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3489628 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
3489629 liberias wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized
3489630 this conflict has been characterized by ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population between 1989 and 1997 and again in 2003 and 2004
3489631 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
3489632 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
3489633 rehabilitation programs that do not address this specific population risk failing a critically vulnerable group
3489634 this unexpected finding suggests that standard post conflict rehabilitation programs and gender based programs will need to adjust current programming to take into account males who have experienced sexual violence especially former combatants
3489635 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3489636 india is home to approximately 2 5 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv the third largest number of cases of any country in the world and is recognized as the source of increasing hiv prevalence among its south asian neighbors
3489637 despite reductions in prevalence of infection among the general population of india women account for a rising percentage of all hiv cases with husbands risk behavior described as the major source of womens infection intimate partner violence ipv has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of hiv to women in india and elsewhere
3489638 in this first national population based study of the relationship of husbands violence against wives to wives hiv infection status as indicated via diagnostic testing married indian women who experienced both physical and sexual ipv demonstrated an hiv infection prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women
3489639 prevention of ipv may augment efforts to reduce the spread of hiv aids
3489640 findings of the present study based on both the large population based sample and the use of standard diagnostic testing for hiv infection should serve to confirm the nature of this relationship and move public health policy makers and practitioners to increase recognition of ipv as a critically important target in the global fight against hiv aids
3489641 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3489642 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3489643 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers

3489646 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3489647 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3489648 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys
3489649 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3489650 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3489651 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary
3489652 adults with limited literacy face formidable problems using the health care system they are less likely to use screening procedures follow medical regimens keep appointments or seek help early in the course of a disease

3489661 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3489662 lin maokes voice didnt quite meet our standard the breadth and depth wasnt quite up to our standards so at last we decided from a sound perspective to use yang peiyi
3489663 the performer was lin miaoke but the sound was yang peiyi the reason is this one was for the benefit of the country the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression and lin miaoke meets our requirements in those aspects
3489664 however from a sound perspective our entire team unanimously agreed that yang peiyi fulfilled all of our requirements and more she is the best
3489665 the voice that lin miaoke heard was actually yang peiyis sound but she herself may not have realized this
3489666 it was played live at a rehearsal there were many different departments especially leaders from the politburo the central communist party leadership who all gave us their opinions that it must change so we had no choice
3489667 i think all of the listeners and audience should also understand this situation this is for the benefit of the country the national culture this is the face the image of the national music culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3489668 i think this situation is fair for lin miaoke and yang peiyi its fair for both of them this is to say we have the best image and the best sound and we combined the two
3489669 why was the original girl not on stage because she was having dental work done

3489678 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3489679 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters

3489692 ergo the russians are using their a team as expected
3489693 the russians have gone to great lengths to try and implicate the ukraine in the russian air force losses even going as far as to suggest that an sa 5 sold to the georgians by the ukraine was responsible for the backfire loss
3489694 thats clearly not the case but shows the russian attempt to bring the ukraine into the periphery of this event by implication and to attempt to explain how one of their premier long range attack assets could have been shot down so easily
3489695 the russian press has been making lots of noise about the buk and tor systems and i would say that the buk is the most likely culprit for all of these aircraft losses
3489696 if so it points out a major flaw in the russian plan not gaining and maintaining pure air superiority and dominance over the battlespace by taking out the georgian air defenses and air defense network before they went into the conflict
3489697 it appears that the russians underestimated the georgian air defense abilities in this conflict and have paid the price
3489698 i think these are good principles to settle the problem to end this dramatic situation
3489699 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment

3489757 although i am confident the original board decision would have withstood all legal challenges by the lafayette county bar association i am equally confident the end results of the challenge would have driven a wedge in our community and caused irreparable harm to the sovereignty of the board of supervisors as well as the lafayette county bar association and its members
3489758 as it is my desire to squelch and suspend the negativity surrounding this matter i will not oppose the relocation of the lafayette county circuit court of the circuit clerk to the newly renovated courthouse notwithstanding there were sensible and prudent reasons economic and otherwise to keep the circuit court at the chancery building
3489759 we are delighted that lloyd oliphant has listened to his constituents and decided to support the relocation of the lafayette county circuit court and clerk to the newly renovated courthouse
3489760 this ensures the investment lafayette county and the city of oxford has made will not be lost allowing the circuit court to move back into the courthouse will ensure the safety and security of the citizens of lafayette county and those who routinely utilize the courts will be protected we look forward to the board of supervisors taking official action on this matter at the earliest possible date
3489761 im just happy he realized the circumstances and came to the conclusion that he did
3489762 it shows hes got character and i applaud that he listened to his constituents and made the right choice
3489763 my vote was devised in a way to divide that requested space that would have surpassed the space available in the courthouse
3489764 what i didnt factor in was the high degree of emotional attachment to the courthouse i sometimes dont give enough credence to that im a nuts and bolts kind of guy

3489785 el estudio de impacto ambiental ser el que determine caso a caso si se puede realizar un proyecto cercano a un glaciar en algunos casos lo impedir y en otros lo permitir para eso no necesitamos una ley con la pol tica nacional basta

3489789 es lamentable que el gobierno sea tan blando ante la presi n de las mineras esa presi n se tiene que manifestar en el parlamento no en el gobierno porque ese sector tiene una comisi n de miner a
3489790 el desarrollo minero va a generar roces pero el parlamento es el lugar para discutir esos puntos
3489791 ahora si hay una normativa que no acepta intervenciones que destruyen un glaciar tambi n me parece razonable pero cualquier tipo de legislaci n tiene que ser suficientemente amplia para que nos permita hacer cierto tipo de actividades ya sea con fines cient ficos tur sticos y recreacionales y tambi n cierta explotaci n del recurso agua
3489792 y eso va a tener un impacto econ mico muy relevante

3489801 theyre spending millions to spread the smear that barack is just a celebrity and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans
3489802 if you love senator barack obama enough to join his fan club youll love higher taxes massive federal spending government run health care and higher gas prices

3489825 we want the government to come clear on this matter because we are still not sure of what type of metal scrap trading was suspended
3489826 there shouldnt be flexibility in the scrap ban which would encourage export of scrap
3489827 as scrap processors we request for effective monitoring and implementation of the policy which has always been a challenge in the past
3489828 if export of scrap is not restricted there will be low supply in the industries something that will directly and indirectly affect output and reduce employment
3489829 it is something that can be processed locally to produce important products
3489830 we want the ministers to come out specifically on the type of scrap they have banned

3489841 i think sir alex realizes we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3489842 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3489843 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again

3489851 it is now a matter of serious concern we would be lucky if india achieves a gdp growth of 8 in the current fiscal as industrial production has suffered heavily

3489858 the negotiations to sign a number nine were stopped some weeks ago following a decision by me and txiki begiristain sporting director

3489875 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3489876 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3489877 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3489878 i want you to remember this place and what im about to tell you a lot of it isnt going to make any sense to you but its important and one day youll understand it well enough the old man paused now that he was here he didnt really know where to start
3489879 this country was different ive told you about hunting about how everybody who obeyed the law could own guns a man could speak out anywhere without worrying about whether hed get back home or not school was different too a man could send his kids to a church school or a private school or even teach them at home but even in the public schools they didnt spend all their time trying to brainwash you like they do at yours now
3489880 things dont ever happen all at once boy they just sort of sneak up on you sure we knew guns were important we just didnt think it would ever happen in america but we had to do something about crime they said it was a crisis everything was a crisis it was a drug crisis or a terrorism crisis or street crime or gang crime even a health care crisis was an excuse to take away a little more of our rights
3489881 they ever let you read a thing called the constitution down there at your school
3489882 well the fourth amendments still in there it says there wont be any unreasonable searches and seizures it says youre safe in your own home
3489883 that had to go it was a crisis they could kick your door open any time day or night and come in with guns blazing if they thought you had drugs or later guns oh at first it was just registration to keep the guns out of the hands of criminals but that didnt work of course and then later when they wanted to take em they knew where to look they banned assault rifles and then sniper rifles and saturday night specials everything you saw on the tv or in the movies was against us god knows the news people were and the schools were teaching our kids that nobody needed guns anymore we tried to take a stand but we felt like the whole face of our country had changed and we were left outside
3489884 me and a friend of mine when we saw what was happening we came and built a secret place up here on the mountain a place where we could put our guns until we needed them we figured some day americans would remember what it was like to be free and what kind of price we had to pay for that freedom so we hid our guns instead of losing them
3489885 one fellow i knew disagreed he said we ought to use our guns now and stand up to the government said that the colonists had fought for their freedom when the british tried to disarm them at lexington and concord well he and a lot of others died in what your history books call the tax revolt of 1998 but son it wasnt the revolt that caused the repeal of the second amendment like your history book says the second amendment was already gone long before they ever repealed it the rest of us thought we were doing the right thing by waiting i hope to god we were right
3489886 you see thomas it isnt government that makes a man free in the end governments always do just the opposite they gobble up freedom like hungry pigs you have to have laws to keep the worst in men under control but at the same time the people have to have guns too in order to keep the government itself under control in our country the people were supposed to be the final authority of the law but that was a long time ago once the guns were gone there was no reason for those who run the government to give a damn about laws and constitutional rights and such they just did what they pleased and anyone who spoke out well im getting ahead of myself
3489887 it took a long time to collect up all the millions of firearms that were in private hands
3489888 i dont know how they found out about me probably knew id been a hunter all those years or maybe somebody turned me in they picked me up on suspicion and took me down to the federal building
3489889 son those guys did everything they could think of to me kept me locked up in this little room for hours no food no water they kept coming in asking me where the guns were what guns i said whenever id doze off theyd come crashing in yelling and hollering i got to where i didnt know which end was up id say i wanted my lawyer and theyd laugh lawyers are for criminals they said youll get a lawyer after we get the guns whats so funny is i know they thought they were doing the right thing they were fighting crime
3489890 when i got home i found ruth sitting in the middle of the living room floor crying her eyes out the house was a shambles while i was down there theyd come out and took our house apart didnt need a search warrant they said national emergency gun crisis your grandma tried to call our preacher and they ripped the phone off the wall told her that theyd go easy on me if she just told them where i kept my guns
3489891 they wouldnt tell her about me where i was or anything that whole time she said that shed thought i was dead she never got over that day and she died the next december
3489892 theyve been watching me ever since off and on i guess theres not much for them to do anymore now that all the guns are gone plenty of time to watch one foolish old man
3489893 anyway i figure that one day america will come to her senses our men will need those guns and theyll be ready we cleaned them and sealed them up good theyll last for years maybe it wont be in your lifetime thomas maybe one day youll be sitting here with your son or grandson tell him about me boy tell him about the way i said america used to be
3489894 you see the way this stone points you follow that line one hundred feet down the hill and youll find a big round rock it looks like its buried solid but one man with a good prybar can lift it and theres a concrete tunnel right under there that goes back into the hill

3489898 o rdinarily when called for militia service able bodied men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time
3489899 in the colonial and revolutionary era small arms weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same
3489900 the most popular weapon chosen by americans for self defense in the home

3489902 the accident investigation board president wignall found by clear and convincing evidence the cause of this accident was a failure of the upper right longeron a critical support structure in the f 15c aircraft
3489903 no inspection requirements existed for detecting a crack in the longeron
3489904 however we are working with the u s air force to analyze the data gathered from fleet wide inspections
3489905 once all of the data have been analyzed a need for further inspection or repair can be determined
3489906 this is the starting point for looking into that question
3489907 this is an aircraft that was designed during the nixon administration
3489908 it doesnt seem sensible to be making fixes so late in the game
3489909 so what do you think we should name the video
3489910 we capped fiscal 2008 with a very strong quarter and finished the year with outstanding growth driven by solid organic increases and successful acquisitions
3489911 just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well endowed female such as baywatch actress pamela lee is equivalent to a 30 minute aerobics work out
3489912 we believe that by doing so consistently the average man can extend his life four to five years
3489913 indeed the whole point of enshrining certain rights in a constitution is to ensure that the liberties they protect not be subject to competing evolving and often as in this case misinformed policy views of government officials and if policy benefits could be invoked to ignore constitutional provisions delegating power to the government this court would soon be asked to adjudicate the existence of everything from the postal monopoly to the income tax

3489949 you can look at any phenomenally successful company and its pretty obvious that their success was founded on building on something they personally wanted the extent that any company begins to deviate from this course is the extent to which their ship starts taking on water and the key leading indicator that theyre getting ready to head off course you guessed it its when they start talking about gathering business requirements
