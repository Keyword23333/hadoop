3160008 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3160009 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3160010 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3160011 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3160012 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3160013 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3160014 based on anecdotal accounts in our discussions with online brokerages both the number of attacks and dollar volume of losses has grown over the past two years
3160015 the reason for that is that most of the controls are retrospective theyre designed to go in after the attack and find the perpetrators
3160016 those old investigative methods dont work anymore its almost impossible to track down the bad guys or hold anyone accountable so it doesnt defer anything
3160017 our software analyzes your trade in milliseconds so the brokerage can let the trader know immediately if theres a potential risk or scam going on
3160018 in that case i assume the brokerage would honor the price at the time of the trade if the customer still wanted to go through with it
3160019 itll be a few months before you see active intervention in place
3160020 whenever you change user behavior you need to put in training and education programs first
3160021 we think this will change the industry and force the fraudsters to evolve so well keep them on their toes
3160022 there is no ultimate solution for online fraud its always an iterative game just like warfare
3160023 but this is a significant escalation on the defensive side because it puts you online brokerages in front of the problem

3160029 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states
3160030 the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbours such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3160031 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3160032 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3160033 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them
3160034 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously

3160064 if some georgians are disappointed by the wests reaction they only have themselves to blame the west will gladly come to georgias aid in many crises but will never do so against a nuclear armed resurgent russia providing troops or air support to georgia would lead to a confrontation with russia that could lead to a a nuclear war and no one wants that saakashvili should have understood that while i sympathize with georgias position saakashvili should loose his job for the actions he took they were lawful but very short sighted and have put the lives of his citizens at grave risk was russias reaction not terribly predictable
3160065 its unfortunate that the georgians were sold a bill of goods by the us and president bush this emboldened them to take the offensive and try to retake south ossetia by force not realizing how forcefully russia would respond and not realizing that the us would sit on the sidelines making empty pronouncements neither the us nor nato will be coming to their rescue hate to say it but they are on their own and at the mercy of the much larger and better equipped russian military

3160089 we do need money to continue to operate and to continue to grow in size
3160090 the interruption of the strong growth trends we have experienced over the past several years was disappointing but we remain extremely confident about our future growth
3160091 we are continuing to focus on our long term goal of achieving annual sales of 500 million by the year 2011 and we are making good progress in executing the primary elements of our strategy in addition we are seeing tangible results from our ongoing operational improvement programs as evidenced by the increase in the gross margin of our carbon fibers business unit to 33 3 in the recent quarter from 29 6 in the second quarter of this year even though acn our primary raw material and energy costs increased to historic highs
3160092 we are working closely with every one of the major wind turbine manufacturers to address their concerns about incorporating carbon fibers in their design and while we cannot predict the exact timing we expect to win new contracts leading to resumption of zolteks rapid sales growth all the major wind turbine producers are designing longer blades and at some length which may be different for each turbine company carbon fiber reinforcement becomes necessary and economically competitive
3160093 the fundamentals of alternative energy generally and wind energy in particular are strong and growing and we expect that growth will continue for many years to come this business is not going away over the next few years its only going to get much bigger
3160094 this demonstration project follows a smaller scale project and if successful will bring us a giant step closer to making carbon fiber a critical part of the mix in deep sea oil and gas production
3160095 the plant in guadalajara is a key building block in rapidly ramping up carbon fibers production over the next several years
3160096 we have been able to successfully retrofit this plant to produce precursor validating our belief that it represented a unique opportunity to expeditiously add capacity at substantially lower capital costs than new construction in addition with profitable operations and ample financial resources we believe zoltek is poised to capitalize on the opportunities that await us
3160097 there is interpretation of medicare regulations that suggest when a person is in custody they are the financial responsibility of the custodial agency

3160139 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
3160140 this loss of data clearly highlights an issue for businesses when sharing sensitive information with third parties
3160141 large organisations may feel confident in their own security practices but problems can arise when information is being shared with third parties who may not have implemented sufficient security settings
3160142 this loss of information would not have posed any kind of threat if the memory stick had been encrypted as a result of weak security procedures the stolen data has in fact provided valuable information with which to perpetrate both virtual and physical crime

3160205 we protest in the strongest terms the arrests of our fellow bah s in iran
3160206 their only crime is their practice of the bah faith
3160207 especially disturbing is how this latest sweep recalls the wholesale arrest or abduction of the members of two national iranian bah governing councils in the early 1980s which led to the disappearance or execution of 17 individuals
3160208 the early morning raids on the homes of these prominent bah s were well coordinated and it is clear they represent a high level effort to strike again at the bah s and to intimidate the iranian bah community at large
3160209 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
3160210 the split decision overturned a previous court ruling and has temporarily denied attempts by tribes and environmental groups to stop arizona snowbowl ski resort from expanding development and making fake snow from treated sewage effluent on the holy mountain
3160211 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
3160212 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
3160213 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
3160214 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices
3160215 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
3160216 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
3160217 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
3160218 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians
3160219 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
3160220 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
3160221 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
3160222 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
3160223 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
3160224 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
3160225 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve

3160317 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well
3160318 its wonderful that pregnant women now have designer styles to choose from especially those that celebrate and compliment the pregnant shape it only becomes a problem when women become unhealthily fixated on remaining a specific size
3160319 it is questionable how many of these sites the market will sustain

3160335 it was formed 10 years ago by a bunch of students from york university we all sang in a student jazz choir there after we graduated we decided we wanted to continue singing together people really liked our first show which sold out
3160336 its more challenging than other types of singing its more rewarding theres something empowering about being able to make music with only your voice
3160337 he was an example of the types of vocalists we aspired to at the time harmony sweepstakes international competition in new york city in 2003 the next level of the competition was in san francisco in which we placed third
3160338 the police would definitely be among my favourites everybody in the group has a different favourite a different experience of what 1980s music meant to them i like groups like the police and paul simon others prefer cyndi lauper xtc and michael jackson
3160339 probably the drums i often act as the vocal drummer in the band with vocal beat boxing people often think of things like hip hop sounds versus rock or jazz sounds we incorporate some public enemy in our oldskool repertoire we have a medley that covers our favourite dances and hip hop pieces
3160340 the only time weve ever done that was when one of our newest members was getting married it was at a led zepellin its the longest karaoke song ever i did everything in my power to keep the crowd involved

3160347 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3160349 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3160350 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe

3160352 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression

3160354 the concept that all beings are equal in the eyes of the universe regardless of their appearance or origins without concern for their beliefs goes against millennia of human history in which slavery torture and murder were the order of the day for those who did not conform to the will of the state
3160355 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
3160356 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion
3160357 it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes
3160358 as those who are trying to earn money solely through their blog and
3160359 as those who are using their blog to promote products and or services

3160362 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
3160363 ah i will make a batch of mint ice tea to enjoy during the upcoming warm spring days and then i can post the recipe on my blog and show off my pot

3160368 its a really interesting question and it gets so complicated i really should write a bicycle sequel
3160369 it is the broker the means of detached and dispassionate interaction between parties with opposed interests buyers want a low price sellers wants a high price the market works out the price that exactly balances these desires a price that is fair because it is the market price
3160370 context of any transaction so long as that transaction is not directly dictated by the state the word has no content of its own because it is defined simply and by reasons of politics by what it is not the market is the nonstate and thus it can do everything the state can do but with none of the procedures or rules or limitations it is a disembodied decision maker a maxwells demon who somehow and without effort balances and reflects the preferences of everyone participating in economic decisions it can be these things precisely because it is nothing at all
3160371 can anyone in modern american politics deny the markets existence or even its relevance
3160372 to do so would be political suicide precisely like denying the existence of god
3160373 may be imperfect that under certain conditions it may fail
3160374 an overwhelming critique of the very concept of the market
3160375 a pill that cures is good a pill that you take every day is better
3160376 economic man is a machine to whom whimsy and evolution are unknown
3160377 man is inconsistent changeable sometimes though not consistently irrational his judgment biased and distorted and influenced by his peers
3160378 the collective judgment of millions of people around the world
3160379 turned the whole world into a parliamentary system whose citizens vote every hour of every day through their mutual funds their pension funds their brokers and more and more from their own basements via the internet
3160380 modern behavioral economics has begun to show that the actual behavior of presumptively competent people
3160381 ordinary intelligent people appear consistently unwilling or unable to calculate the consequences of their decisions in a manner predicted by the view that they are responding purely to the market instead they act as social beings concerned about their standing with their peers about the fairness of the deal they are being offered and other matters quite irrelevant to the utility of the object or money on offer
3160382 the autonomous individual is not the active agent who matters most
3160383 the capacity to adjust the presentation of such products to what research and experience indicate the public will actually buy
3160384 the capacity to influence the publics buying preferences through advertising
3160385 free to choose only among a menu of items set out for sale
3160386 the freedom to shop is for the rest of us an incident to this freedom
3160387 he concept of a freedom to shop has been extended insidiously into the realm of careers where it plays even greater havoc with the normal use of words in a free capitalist society with private schools and universities free to admit whom they please and charge what the market will bear the freedom to choose ones profession becomes in part the freedom to become what one can afford to become
3160388 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him
3160389 he even stopped shooting so he could go to the doctor and get it checked out we all had to wait around for him to come back
3160390 on his return i tried to discuss the scene with him again and he started complaining about the doctor who had said there was nothing wrong with him
3160391 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3160392 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3160393 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3160394 inconsistent with the assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo
3160395 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3160396 i got a big fight out in the middle of a street
3160397 everybody else is joining in now i am going back in my house

3160416 i heard a bam like somebody ran into a car like a car ran into a car my daughter ran in the room and told me she heard gun shots i could hear a lady i could hear a lady hysterical and then the police came
3160417 alarmed but not afraid because east topeka is known for that i mean its common place to hear gun shots
3160418 things are unpredictable around this neighborhood and id like to see it a little more calmer but east topeka has always been like that

3160420 the proposal would bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats
3160421 together we and our customers will work hard to help close to 10 million children 5 million seniors and countless homeless and near homeless families that are going through personal and natural disasters the money we raise will help support food pantries soup kitchens emergency shelters school breakfast lunch and after school programs
3160422 it is an outrage that the majority of agencies in america are helping other countries and not concentrating on the people we have in this country who are homeless and without food we have single mothers living on the streets without shelter food or even clean water for their children charity begins at home and america is our home

3160653 today china has around ten million junk collectors who are in truth the only green recyclers in the nation they traverse the streets of chinas cities often on tricycles ringing handbells they collect bottles glass paper cardboard pots and pans old electrical goods clothing in short anything that has even the smallest cash value based on its recyclability they are in effect recycling road warriors in may 2007 a new law came into force the regulation on recycling resources stipulated that scrap collectors should not only obtain a business license but also register with their local commerce bureaus the reason these millions of people work as junk collectors is of course that they have only received the most basic if any education most of them are among the poorest levels of society how can such disadvantaged people as these recycling road warriors be expected to enter into and negotiate the complex labyrinth of chinese bureaucracy if theyre driven out of business by strict enforcement of the regulation many scrap collectors would be left with nothing to do as most are from the countryside and have had little education or skills training noted media collecting recyclable material on the roads and streets of china is not a career choice it is however a logical choice brought about by desperation the chinese government by restricting them is pushing them down rather than helping them up seemingly not realizing that the road warriors are the first soldiers of the green army
3160654 we are concerned that investment proposals do not match consumer priorities and believe that the work they are proposing will push prices up beyond what customers are willing to pay

3160660 it is more similar to strains previously identified in europe italy asia afghanistan and the middle east iran in 2007
3160661 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3160662 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3160663 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa

3160681 we need to develop our service team because they talk to customers who are placing orders we really feel that they dont deliver great service and miss lots of opportunities to up and cross sell they dont really have the skills to develop a great rapport with the customer in the beginning of the call and i think thats where the breakdown starts we have a staff of 35 representatives but we only want to spend 8 000 and we need drastic improvements as a result
3160682 did you hear that that was classic i love it the customer took control over when there was dead air they always do that

3160695 expectant motherhood is an exciting thing but it can also be very hectic and stressful
3160696 what we put together for ms presley was a combination of pre natal vitamins and non toxic eco friendly skincare products that would be safe for both she and her twins additionally we invited her to visit us for a complimentary pregnancy massage great for eliminating pre birth stressors and toxins as well as our popular pure pregnancy facial customized to meet the specific needs of her skin

3160700 joe mathlete explains todays marmaduke in 500 words or less
3160701 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3160702 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3160703 most people are familiar with 20 20 vision and do not realize that the limit of human vision is 20 08 many elite athletes see better than 20 20 which is not surprising since the superior demands of competition require their visual systems to perform at the highest level
3160704 at every level of competition vision is emerging as an area that athletes can develop to improve their performance the technology in the achievevision program allows us to measure vision beyond that 20 20 mark and assess the different visual skills needed in each sport this is a breakthrough that means we can customize vision care for each athlete those who see exceptionally well and those who need basic vision correction and incorporate it into their training
3160705 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3160706 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives

3160734 joomla rocks or how to build a professional web site for no money down
3160735 joomla is technically an open source content management system cms but its much for than that for those of us whove been conditioned to think that running a web site means youre locked into a hard to change difficult to use platform working with joomla is a real eye opener
3160736 playing around with joomla made the awesome possibilities of web 2 0 really come alive for me for the first time it was also a heck of a lot of fun heres what i threw together in not too many hours of playing go to alexwolfe net joomla
3160737 they dont need to do the same elsewhere simply because what is happening in georgia has already driven home the message that what happens in these russian enclaves wherever they are is for russia to determine and no one else
3160738 the message is you do not touch any of them because the russian military is determined to defend them even if it means crossing an international border with their tanks
3160739 absolutely no doubt that one of his key calculations was ukraine

3160741 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like the way they are being treated
3160742 i think the biggest problem is not the young people its squarely the police
3160743 i think its important we have this sentiment of security and the only way we can have it is by being very transparent in the investigation that will be put forward by the minister of public security
3160744 i was very clear with him this morning that this has to be done as soon as possible and the information will be made public
3160745 were there to listen to understand what happened yesterday sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations

3160752 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3160753 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3160754 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3160755 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3160756 due to his state of mind at the time there is a possibility that he did cross the centre line intentionally to take his own life and he did unfortunately take someone else with him
3160757 its really a tragic situation on both sides two families are grieving
3160758 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3160759 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3160760 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3160761 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3160762 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
3160763 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs
3160764 at some point it becomes like a saturday night live skit where youre paying for a seat belt and to use the bathroom theyre running out of things to charge us for
3160765 final 8 state websites the websites that were in contention as of june
3160766 nearly 1 55 billion passengers arrived and departed from north american airports in 2007 a 3 5 percent increase from the previous year
3160767 traveling is a luxury you will have to pay more for it live and fly with it
3160768 airlines must change the rules in order to survive high oil prices and the other challenges the industry faces
3160769 as passengers we need to realize that the cost of our airline ticket does not cover these extra services
3160770 will airline ticket prices go down with the price of oil
3160771 dots auction proposal is unlawful unwise and will do absolutely nothing to reduce congestion and flight delays in new york dot has left us no options we will sue to prevent this illegal action
3160772 if ritz carlton hotels put a commercial jetliner into service it would be like the airbus
3160773 the road is a whole lot older that what it was these roads have a certain life span and weve come to the end of that there are a whole lot more people who live in clay and cicero now that what they did before so that whole area of the traffic flow has changed dramatically so its time not only just to look at 81 through the city of syracuse but to look at the entire corridor all the way from central square to lafayette
3160774 there was some study done i believe about depressing that highway but therere a number of hurdles regarding drainage when you depress a highway and it was done in conjunction with the plan at the time to make the large civic community center where the everson and the convention center garage is going to be and those things
3160775 i think it really is going to take two years because one issue will come up and that will get people thinking and then there will be another change as far as how they look at the project
3160776 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off
3160777 i am excited about it in some way every show that followed
3160778 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3160779 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3160780 im really excited to be part of the joomlatools team
3160781 there is no doubting the massive contributions made by joomlas principal architect johan janssens and marketing media guru pete russell they and fellow joomlatools founders mathias verraes and laurens vanderput exemplify what open source is all about the quality code professionalism and fun just about says it all

3160786 this whole genre of model programs sends a very strong message to young people that your main capacity for success in this world is to market yourself sexually
3160787 instead of being part of the solution this teacher is part of the problem hes helping to generate these very very toxic messages that is driving young girls to body image problems and eating disorders and other psychological difficulties
3160788 its not the behaviour parents would expect from a teacher who is a role model for students under their care
3160789 the school community wishes rhys well hes a very popular teacher with the staff students and parents and we cant wait to have him back at school
3160790 i love teaching kids but i need a bit of variety in my life
3160791 this new plan september 2014 aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be the available resources
3160792 we are slowing down the work to match and stay under our available funding and to do that we had to go to a later date
3160793 we are adhering to our commitment date of march 2015 for initial operating capability
3160794 our confidence that the gap will get no worse than five years has actually improved
3160795 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year

3160799 this is no longer a political issue its a matter of survival for my friends and neighbors so i am issuing today a call to randy kuhl to use his close personal relationship with president bush to actually get something done
3160800 if mr massa wants to put his money where his mouth is he would return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from the speaker otherwise his statement is just deceptive its hypocritical and it highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress
3160801 american families are experiencing a horrific burden that the skyrocketing cost of gasoline has inflicted upon them and while house republicans have proposed solution after legislative solution to americas energy crisis the democratic leadership has chosen to rename post offices instead of bring to the floor our legislation
3160802 the american energy act is a comprehensive energy bill that includes conserving more drilling in america bringing online additional refineries and developing all viable alternative fuel sources i call on my democratic colleagues to help america achieve energy independence and allow an up or down vote on this bill
3160803 families in western new york are sick of excuses congress needs to take immediate action to end these skyrocketing gas prices and implement a long term strategy to get us off of foreign oil
3160804 when randy kuhl first took office the national average for a gallon of gas was 1 70 today it is well over 4 00 it is time for democrats and republicans to stop bickering and work together to find a real solution to lower our gas prices we need to drill for oil in the 68 million acres of land already zoned for production use a small portion of our strategic reserve to immediately stabilize the market and lower prices and fund research and development for alternative energy technologies

3160806 it is enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have made all the difference

3160811 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3160812 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally

3161020 despite strong opposition from its own shareholders and other constituencies and the severe antitrust regulatory and financing challenges associated with its unsolicited proposal to acquire republic waste management is pushing ahead with its attempt to disrupt our two companies strategic plans with another offer that pales in comparison to the significant value that will be generated through the combination of republic and allied
3161021 waste managements suggestion that its proposal presents less risk on regulatory matters than a republic allied combination is pure tactical rhetoric that should be rejected out of hand
3161022 the waste management republic combination would create an entity nearly three times as large as any other market participant and would eliminate significant existing competition in many areas throughout the country
3161023 perhaps the greatest loss resulting from waste managements hostile offer to acquire republic would be the benefits that would flow from the pending allied waste republic transaction itself combined allied waste republic will have greater capacity to compete with waste management for national bids and invest in innovation and new facilities including additional recycling capacity

3161036 los australianos fueron bravos y trabajaron duro llegaron con un plan y lo ejecutaron casi a la perfecci n pero al final fueron derrotados por un equipo argentino que simplemente fue mejor en verdad los albicelestes son los mejores del grupo y candidatos a la medalla de oro
3161037 argentina presion y domin toda la noche pero pareci estrellarse contra una muralla amarilla juan riquelme y lionel messi fueron una amenaza constante pero casi nunca encontraron los espacios que tuvieron contra costa de marfil
3161038 pero al final argentina fue un equipo que supo tener paciencia supo que la oportunidad llegar a en alg n momento y a los 76 minutos despu s de una jugada de alt simo nivel entre riquelme messi y angel de mar a ezequiel lavezzi anot el gol de una muy merecida victoria

3161041 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3161042 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america

3161055 the blast equivalent to about 13 000 tons of tnt literally scoured out the center of the city and the resulting fires took care of most of the rest about 70 000 people perished within hours of the blast with another 70 000 dying before the end of 1945 three days later 63 years ago today history would repeat itself over the city of nagasaki this time a plutonium bomb was used increasing the efficiency of the device dramatically due to some topographical quirks there were no large hills as in hiroshima to focus the blast effect the casualty rate was lower still fat man managed to kill more than 40 000 that day and another 40 000 before that fateful year faded into history
3161056 army air force commander of strategic forces in the pacific curtis lemay believed if given six months and freedom to target whatever he wished he could bring japan to its knees by completely destroying its ability to feed itself victory assured at the cost of several million starved japanese the navy thought a blockade would do the trick starving the japanese war machine of raw materials and the people of food they were importing from occupied china would have the japanese government begging for peace in a matter of six months to a year again visions of millions of dead from starvation came with the plan the army saw invasion as the only option a landing on the southernmost main island of kyushu followed up by an attack on the kanto plain near tokyo on the island of honshu dubbed operation downfall the plan called for the first phase to be carried out in october of 1945 with the main battle for japan taking place in the spring of 1946 casualty estimates have been hotly debated over the years but it seems reasonable to assume that many hundreds of thousands of americans would have been killed or wounded while depending on how fiercely civilians resisted perhaps several million japanese would have died in the assault
3161057 it is hard to grasp the wave of helplessness that descended on many in the civilian and military leadership as they watched the japanese on okinawa fight so fanatically and to the death the prospect of invasion and continued combat throughout the pacific was frightening
3161058 the allies issued an ultimatum to japan surrender or suffer the consequences the die was cast and the fate of hiroshima and nagasaki was sealed
3161059 but once just once i would like to hear the horror stories of the men and women of pearl harbor as counterpoint to the suffering of the japanese and a reminder of who started the war and how they did it i want to hear from those who can tell equally horrific tales of death and destruction how japanese aircraft strafed our men with machine gun fire while they were swimming for their lives through flaming oil spills the result of a surprise attack against a nation with whom they were at peace or how the hundreds of men trapped in the uss arizona slowly suffocated over 10 days as divers frantically tried to cut through the superstructure and rescue their comrades perhaps we might even ask surviving pows to bear witness to their ordeal in japanese prison camps surely as brutal inhuman and gruesome an atrocity as has ever been inflicted on enemy soldiers while were at it i am sure there are thousands of witnesses who would want to testify about how the japanese army raped its way across asia this little discussed aspect of the war is a non event for the most part in japanese histories but the millions of women who suffered unspeakable mistreatment by the japanese army deserve a hearing whenever the tragedy of hiroshima is remembered

3161071 ces actions menacent les relations avec les etats unis et leurope
3161072 ces actions seraient en contradiction avec les assurances que nous avons re ues de la part de la russie que ses objectifs se limitaient restaurer le statu quo
3161073 il y a des preuves que les forces russes pourraient bient t bombarder la roport civil de la capitale g orgienne si ces informations sont exactes ces actions de la part des russes repr senteraient une escalade dramatique et brutale du conflit en g orgie

3161076 nuisent grandement limage de la russie dans le monde et ces actions mettent en danger les relations de la russie avec les etats unis et leurope

3161079 the only thing most people around here know how to do is grow sugar and play football
3161080 it will survive but no one knows what will be left of it
3161081 i think its going to have a really big effect around here
3161082 theres nothing really to do besides work for sugar companies and play football here i dont have to worry about it but them little kids coming up will

3161095 even though the jury acquitted me of these charges in less than three hours my political opponents and some of the news media would likely spend the next several months vilifying me further

3161099 as far as big box retailers go it s hard to dispute the sphere of influence that ikea casts over the world market striking a golden balance between quality and affordability has allowed the furniture giant to build an extensive network of 270 stores in 35 countries attracting half a billion customers every year ikea s recent investment is exciting because it stands to mobilize these massive distribution channels towards the proliferation of green technology
3161100 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
3161101 if there is a silver lining in all of this its that users will become more aware and more conscious of who they do business with
3161102 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
3161103 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
3161104 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited
3161105 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
3161106 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades
3161107 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
3161108 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
3161109 we have been trained since we were young to lock the door to our house our car we take these sensible security measures in the environment we are functioning in
3161110 yet when it comes to computer safety we forget to look both ways before crossing the internet highway
3161111 in het judo ben ik de laatste jaren vaak omver gegooid maar het heeft er wel voor gezorgd dat ik in het normale leven kon blijven staan
3161112 rusland heeft zijn spierballen laten zien en getoond dat het in zijn invloedssfeer zich hevig zal verzetten tegen navo uitbreiding maar als het bijvoorbeeld olie en gaspijpleidingen aanvalt die deels in westerse handen zijn dan neemt de internationale betrokkenheid enorm toe daar heeft het geen belang bij dat kan te veel gevolgen hebben voor de relatie met westerse markten waar het afhankelijk van is
3161113 stop er nu mee en claim het morele gelijk in de kwestie zuid osseti of ga door veroorzaak de val van het regime in tbilisi en negeer de westerse woede er zijn signalen dat de haviken de leiding hebben en met name ex president en huidig premier poetin die met de georgische president saakasjvili vrijwel een persoonlijke vete heeft hij reageerde al boos vanuit peking uren voordat president medvedev die eigenlijk over buitenlandse politiek gaat red iets verklaarde hij vloog naar vladikavkaz om de russische aanpak te co rdineren en dreigend te voorspellen dat het georgische volk een objectief oordeel zal geven over zijn eigen leiders
3161114 het gaat niet alleen om het verwijderen van de symbolische persoon saakasjvili ze maken wel duidelijk dat ze nooit met hem willen praten en de relatie dus nooit verbetert zolang hij aan de macht is maar ze proberen ook zijn team op te breken zijn regering is in georgi het eerste coherente team sinds de onafhankelijkheid dat een duidelijke nationale agenda voert zoals een liberaal economisch beleid het elimineren van criminele clans uit het bedrijfsleven het versterken van de natiestaat als dat team uiteenvalt bestaat het risico dat georgi terugvalt naar de brute politiek van de jaren negentig toen onder president sjevardnadze maffiose groepen met elkaar de strijd aanbonden red de russen willen groepen aan de macht die hun beleid co rdineren met moskou
3161115 i should also add that i shared my views on relationships with bow wow because beyond his relationship with angela i wanted to make sure that he was on the right path too
3161116 now you know in this house we dont believe in premarital sex i said so if youre truly serious about angela and shes truly serious about you then we have very high expectations for how you two are going to act so if youre serious about angela then ask her to marry you and do this the right way and if youre not then you two can go your separate ways and still be friends
3161117 theres a history there of agencies making contributions for things they benefit from
3161118 tolls and fares continue to be the last resort as we think about what we need to do to keep the turnpike and the t in good financial condition
3161119 key drivers of revenue such as investment banking and mergers and acquisitions have simply not been happening enough to stimulate related business
3161120 at the moment the light at the end of this tunnel is very dim
3161121 in near term a turnaround in the companys earnings is not in prospect
3161122 i think theres a strong possibility there is a drug connection just because of the nature of the business of the mexican mafia and other prison gangs

3161129 ive been working hard im never satisfied i think you can always improve my goal is to work harder than anyone else out there im hungry i want to eat i want to be the best and that means getting stronger faster quicker im going to do whatever it takes

3161131 i just know that ill be taking a visit to kansas in september and october
3161132 gasprijzen volgen de olieprijs vrij precies maar met een vertraging van een half jaar
3161133 het effect van de extreemste olieprijs van de laatste maanden volgt dus nog
3161134 maar het kan ook zijn dat consumenten er met 144 euro prijsstijging nog goed vanaf komen
3161135 onderzoek hiernaar moet nog plaatsvinden maar energiebedrijven willen zichzelf met prijsopvoering niet in de vingers snijden bijna alle nederlanders kunnen immers overstappen
3161136 daarbij stond de dienende functie van typografie voorop met alle aandacht voor de inhoud van de tekst
3161137 je kunt gerust zeggen dat flexibel werken tien jaar geleden zeker in deze branche een cultuurschok was

3161139 sommige ruimtes zijn populairder dan andere bij deze oorstoelen vind je op drukke dagen als maandag nauwelijks plek een ruimte met meubels van sloophout bleek niet comfortabel om te werken dat is aangepast
3161140 het is niet alleen vrijheid blijheid het is niet de bedoeling dat sommige groepjes of afdelingen telkens dezelfde plekken confisqueren ook moet de bezetting op de afzonderlijke verdiepingen van de afdelingen goed blijven daarom zijn er vloermanagers aangesteld die een oogje in het zeil houden en indien nodig mensen wijzen op een juist gebruik van de ruimtes
3161141 je moet je wel verbonden blijven voelen met je team ook als je twee of drie dagen per week thuis werkt
3161142 managers moeten dus bewust hun medewerkers eens in de zoveel tijd bij elkaar brengen
3161143 wie na 1980 geboren is is dankzij bijvoorbeeld hyves en msn volkomen gewend aan het werken in communities en staat dankzij de moderne communicatietechnologie voortdurend in contact met elkaar het klassieke kantoorconcept met aparte hokjes en eigen bureaus is denk ik volkomen pass
3161144 er wordt al tijden gezocht naar een niet dodelijk wapen dat arrestatieteams kunnen gebruiken als het gaat om afstanden tot acht meter zoals je voor de grotere afstanden een beanbag een zakje met loodkorrels zo groot als bonen red hebt
3161145 je wilt iemand uitschakelen op een manier waarbij je zo min mogelijk letsel toebrengt
3161146 het gaat ons niet zo zeer om het gebruik van het wapen zelf want het verkleinen van risicos tijdens arrestaties kunnen we alleen maar toejuichen
3161147 in de vs en canada wordt het echter laagdrempelig ingezet ook politieagenten mogen het gebruiken
3161148 of als het tegelijk gebruikt wordt met andere middelen zoals pepperspray of dat iemand niet n keer maar tien keer getaserd wordt dan krijg je een optelsom van tien maal 50 000 volt
3161149 binnen vijf jaar zijn er 150 mensen overleden nadat ze beschoten zijn met het stroomstootpistool
3161150 deze proef gaat om arrestatieteams die zijn sowieso zwaar bewapend als we maar blijven oppassen voor de valkuil van de glijdende schaal
3161151 het pijnlijkst zijn die haakjes die in je lichaam worden geschoten
3161152 meteen daarna komt de stroomstoot maar dat doet niet echt pijn het voelt vooral heel raar je gaat automatisch liggen je schrikt enorm je krijgt een soort epileptische aanval
3161153 misschien klinkt het raar maar ik ben enorm te spreken over dit wapen het lijkt me heel effectief ik word liever met een taser neergelegd dan dat ik een of andere politiehond op mn dak krijg want met een hond weet je bijna zeker dat je er letsel aan overhoudt
3161154 if the us can get a point in this game they have a chance of qualifying for the next round
3161155 ok not too bad down one goal they can tie it up
3161156 theres no reason to dwell on it im thankful to have things work out to where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here and work with my teammates when its all said and done thats all that matters to me is what my teammates feel and believe we were able to win a lot of games last year and we could have won some more games but we were able to win our division i definitely want to do that again and build on that this year with me at quarterback growing and getting more comfortable i think i can help this team do a lot of good things

3161176 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
3161177 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
3161178 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this

3161186 smaller numbers of meteors will be visible on monday evening since light from a nearly full moon will wash out fainter meteors the number of meteors visible will increase when the moon sets at around 0130 local time on tuesday for observers at mid northern latitudes
3161187 the meteors will appear all over the sky so the best strategy is to lie down and stare at as large a patch of sky as possible away from the moon if it is still up

3161338 attempts to remain aligned with the rise in crude oil prices
3161339 but about halfway through the season we found that we were not getting the return on investment we needed so we pulled our tv ads and put that money into more print and radio placements we thought that the tv spots we had produced last year just werent striking the right chord with our potential single ticket buyers which is the target audience for the bulk of our advertising campaign
3161340 we thought these spots might appeal to a broader audience than our old tv ads so we thought youtube would be a great free way to get them in front of more people were also expanding our placements on wnpt our local public television station and expanding our online ad buys this season

3161383 as a dj and musician there are many places to have your music and information listed such as myspace and so on but i feel i can do more with a site that is my own i can customize it to fit all my needs picaholic is the one site that allows me to do all my changes as soon as possible that myspace does not allow

3161398 we are not staying home with our children by default
3161399 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3161400 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheque wont come its that much more frightening

3161414 the band staff is not very big so they get a chance to do a lot of teaching
3161415 the section leaders are in charge of how the band sounds and the rank leaders are in charge of how the band looks
3161416 my main goal is to keep our outstanding pregame show with the history and tradition but i also want to continue to take the band to new levels and always work hard
3161417 whatever our endeavors we always want to re earn the title the pride of west virginia

3161419 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
3161420 that basically builds our customer base and our loyalty because once someone buys the blu ray device we think were the best location for them to return and either rent or buy their blu ray products
3161421 we are seeing more momentum behind blu ray as hdtv penetration continues to grow it should be a strong holiday for the format
3161422 theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output
3161423 we have two contrary philosophies going on in this country
3161424 forever we have essentially funded our highway infrastructure based on a tax on fossil fuels at the same time we in the country are doing everything we can to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel the two are 180 degrees opposed to each other
3161425 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
3161426 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined

3161439 we get any manner of odd birds showing up out of nowhere to stay for the afternoon or maybe a couple of years
3161440 as everyone knows one of the problems we have in this country is obesity in the young
3161441 a part of it is that we just eat so well and a part of it is the lack of physcial activity at the y they learn how enjoyable it can be to be in good shape

3161451 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3161452 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3161453 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3161460 when the season was over the community council contacted my mom and she ran it by me
3161461 i was honored we planned a day for july 20 the township is about 700 and its where i grew up i was really happy for everyone involved a lot more people showed up than they expected
3161462 they had lots of teal in it so hopefully ill be with the sharks for a while
3161463 it was a great feeling and i let them know i was very honored
3161464 i know how much theyve supported me and the sign meant a lot a lot of people back home stay up late to watch the games
3161465 a lot of people asked if i remembered them but i havent forgotten them
3161466 in june i went to the k 12 school and it has about 350 students
3161467 its great to go and see the kids and sign autographs

3161470 i say i know this girl shes looking for this kind of a guy and then we look through our files and we say it looks like ive got a match
3161471 just trying to enjoy 100 per cent the experience and later try my best on court
3161472 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3161473 i did the right things to come out on top
3161474 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3161475 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3161476 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3161477 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3161478 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3161479 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mind set
3161480 unfortunately the credit crunch hit at the same time as portability
3161481 if we werent experiencing that portability would be really really impressing people it will work for us yet im utterly convinced of that
3161482 we have banned a number of mortgage brokers and others this year in connection with mortgage fraud and we will continue to make examples of people who commit mortgage fraud until behaviour changes

3161485 hope we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3161486 we erected barricades at several places on the srinagar muzafarrabad road
3161487 we have suffered a loss of at least 20 million rupees since this agitation began
3161488 and if the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us
3161489 concerns are growing that a sustained battle could drive oil prices higher it may turn out that the retreat in oil gas prices over the past few weeks may prove to be a short lived phenomenon
3161490 the offer of repayable investment from northern ireland and uk government departments is subject to eu approval and we are confident it is fully compliant with eu and international requirements
3161491 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto world trade organization
3161492 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the u k to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3161493 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3161494 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3161495 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3161496 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3161497 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3161498 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3161499 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3161500 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3161501 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3161502 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3161503 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3161504 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3161505 we are not staying home with our children by default
3161506 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3161507 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheque wont come its that much more frightening
3161508 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3161509 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3161510 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3161511 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3161512 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3161513 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3161514 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3161515 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3161516 im trying to work out a babysitting swap arrangement with friends
3161517 if it works well go and see the new batman movie maybe
3161518 this is an act of desperation what youre seeing today
3161519 the next logical question you ask yourself as an analyst is are they getting ready to this private
3161520 the actions that weve taken today are obviously to give us financial flexibility
3161521 suppliers in china are working on tighter credit restrictions as part of everything that were doing with our value enhancement plan thats why we are taking this action today
3161522 is in serious financial difficulty due to inadequate liquidity in this period of high demand for working capital before the holiday season
3161523 they would have a hard time selling it to anybody to circle back once theyve got the current issues under control
3161524 probably in every single discipline you can imagine they got into new territory and they couldnt manage it they didnt have the skills and still dont
3161525 fairfax continually reviews its investment alternatives and may purchase additional convertible debentures or common shares of mega brands from time to time in accordance with applicable laws
3161526 the budget for an effective social media marketing campaign begins at 50k for a two to three month period im sure companies have spent less and i know theyve spent more
3161527 we made the decision to go with one name so that its a consistent experience for customers
3161528 still thriving and this is just a process where we can deliver better service
3161529 cindy has a strong reputation for working to create a better future for cranston she has been vocal on issues of finance education and health care and knows how to listen and respond to the needs of the community
3161530 a smart tough experienced leader who will put local government to work for cranston families im confident that she will work hard to make one of rhode islands largest cities a great place to live work and raise a family
3161531 i think if you threw me into the dallas lineup in that series against detroit it definitely would have made a difference
3161532 i think you always work to help your team reach the top and that includes getting guys to play their best and remain healthy
3161533 its a matter of taking the group of players we have and putting them in a situation where they can be complementary and produce our young guys came in and developed well last year no disrespect to the other teams in our conference but i feel we can compete with all of them
3161534 i know ive had my battles with brenden in the past but the good thing about hockey players is the fact once you become teammates that stuff is all forgotten
3161535 itll be exciting to play on the same team maybe even on the same line you almost have more respect for the guys youve battled in the past even a guy like steve ott who i know ill enjoy playing with itll probably bring my penalty minutes down a bit because it seems i always ended up fighting or scrapping with one of those guys itll be tough for other teams to play against me brenden modano ribeiro and richards and ott its going to be a lot of fun
3161536 ive proven myself in the playoffs and thats the part of the season that i consider the most exciting time
3161537 i feel i can bring a physical presence whether thats a kick start or bringing something else to the table i feel itll certainly help our chances against a team like detroit or san jose or anaheim or whoever we face in the playoffs
3161538 this is a better team than the one i formerly played on so thats a big attraction and very important to me because being able to win provides more opportunities
3161539 the relationship i had with brett and now with his moving on to management and the faith he has in me that i can come in and help the team win also played a big role
3161540 brett was my favorite player growing up and then 10 years later i end up living with him
3161541 i probably took on his persona a little bit and i dont think i was really ready to do that but as far as watching a guy play and being able to read the game he was certainly beneficial
3161542 i think im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expecting a lot out of me im willing to take it to the next level and i think i proved what level i can take my game in new york
3161543 when you put the jersey on you represent the team and the city and i certainly do cross the line at times but its not out of anything other than wanting to win the game
3161544 i think im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expecting a lot out of me
3161545 its a nice feeling knowing i could be in a situation where players will be together for a four or five year span
3161546 thats what you want to have an opportunity to win two or three cups in a four or five year period detroit is a perfect example theyve kept their nucleus together and brought in a few other guys and it has worked
3161547 it is an amazing feeling to be in a place that is buzzing with world class athletes and everyone soaking up the experience but yet all there with one big purpose the ever elusive gold medal
3161548 its definitely motivating rubbing shoulders with your peers who are all well established in their fields and also with your countrymen a lot of whom you meet for the first time there is a camaraderie in your designated housing blocks which is an experience that one only feels at the games
3161549 today is my day off and so i am going to spend some time soaking in the village and actually getting my mind to do something it has never done before not think about shooting instead of thinking about perfect bulls eyes today i am going to think of the pretty women in the village the weather the great city of beijing and whatever else pops into my mind will be allowed to stay as long it doesnt involve the words rifle shooting in it it is a great time to be an athlete and this event is what we all live for
3161550 the food at these athletes villages is in abundance so much choice that you sometimes get there and spend a good amount of time being confused whether you are really hungry or not

3161556 2 3 billion people in the world claim to be followers of jesus
3161557 the old paradigm was you pay you pray you get out of the way
3161558 theres a church in every village in the world the potential sits there like a sleeping giant
3161559 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3161560 im so tired of christians being known for what theyre against
3161561 one of my goals is to take evangelicals back a century to the 19th century
3161562 that was a time of muscular christianity that cared about every aspect of life
3161563 im worried that evangelicals be identified too much with one party or the other when that happens you lose your prophetic role of speaking truth to power
3161564 and you have to defend stupid things that leaders do
3161565 politics is always downstream from culture i place less confidence in it than a lot of folks i dont think thats the answer politics is not the right tool to change the culture
3161566 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3161567 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3161568 be on special alert its a 4 cheeseburger day out there today
3161569 there is little scope even in contemporary society for disputing that freedom of speech is regarded as fundamental subject to reasonable regulation for the purposes of an ordered society

3161571 t he most self absorbed unstable because i say so ranter ive ever encountered in the blogosphere
3161572 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century he said in his strongest condemnation yet of the fighting
3161573 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said
3161574 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardise russias relations with the united states and europe mr bush warned
3161575 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government he said
3161576 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush
3161577 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and would be
3161578 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3161579 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3161580 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3161581 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3161582 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3161583 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3161584 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3161585 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3161586 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3161587 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3161588 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3161589 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3161590 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3161591 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3161592 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3161593 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3161594 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3161595 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3161596 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3161597 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear
3161598 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector
3161599 not only will you see panels on the roofs of your local stores but i suspect very soon retailers will have stickers in their windows saying this is a green energy store
3161600 we want to keep pushing as many as we possibly can
3161601 its going to be the wal marts of the world that will buy these things over acres and make a difference
3161602 were hoping that our purchases along with some other retailers will help bring the technology costs down
3161603 every project that starts development has to be finished by dec 31 or you lose tax equity advantage and nobodys willing to take that risk
3161604 solar has become part of the kit that we think about when we open a store
3161605 in germany there are none of the concerns you find in the united states about whether support will be around next year
3161606 one of the challenges is that these things are just flying all over the hemisphere
3161607 so to figure out the needs of these birds sorting out the why requires this huge geographic understanding of the populations and nobody really has that
3161608 documenting this is critical because you cant get groups to act unless you have good data to justify the action
3161609 but when youre dealing with birds that are moving so much it becomes very difficult
3161610 were in the process of building a north american wide monitoring program
3161611 but funding has been limited and you can imagine how difficult it is to track birds across the arctic
3161612 even if weve been successful with restoring wetlands what are they going to look like in 50 years with sea levels rising
3161613 some days i sit here and think with increasing human population sizes and no federal leadership and no curb on consumerism its hard to imagine how were going to do it
3161614 i am saying to the boys to handle what we have got to do next week which is to go to canberra and play
3161615 i think we would need to improve on what we did tonight i think thats the understatement of the year
3161616 obviously i think we can play much better and we are going to need to play better in the coming weeks
3161617 i think the few sides we have got obviously starting with canberra next week are playing really well at the moment
3161618 an item as simple as having too much air in a tire can result in a blow out after loading the car with your summer belongings
3161619 i had a bit of nerves in the marshalling area but once i got out it was okay
3161620 i could have done better but i will swim harder in the finals
3161621 my plan was to go out hard and have a crack maybe i went out a little bit too hard
3161622 i just have so much energy to burn still and fell amazing
3161623 we were extremely pleased with the bidder turn out as well as the prices realized for this years auction which exceeded expectations to be up 20 from last years sale and set world records for major sporting artists in this economic climate is a testament to our firms position in the market place
3161624 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
3161625 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
3161626 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
3161627 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
3161628 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
3161629 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
3161630 if only i could find a great caring sensitive handsome guy but taken down a notch or two
3161631 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3161632 as you may know if a candidate fails to get at least 15 at a precinct caucus their supporters can switch and choose to caucus with those backing other candidates or declare themselves uncommitted
3161633 if the presidential caucus in iowa were held today please tell me which of the following people would be your second choice
3161634 this project has been a chance for many of us to discover how amazingly true barack obamas concept of how we are the people we need is at this fiercely urgent moment at our generations now as our country and world has endured huge struggles and missteps in our recent history this dedicated group of supporters has climbed onto the platform obama has constructed to unify us all and are taking the message to heart by teaming up and using our strengths to leap toward solutions that make a difference to citizens now
3161635 we want our music to help amplify the struggles faced by katrina victims from one of our countrys largest disasters raise money for their efforts to rebuild and help show the power of obamas message when enthusiastically and diligently executed
3161636 press the send button to reset the phone or any other button to cancel this operation will delete all of your personal data and reset the phone to factory settings
3161637 if thats the case its really ridiculous theres no kid who deserves to be shaken at all no matter what goes on i mean theyre just a kid youre supposed to protect them not hurt them
3161638 weve looked at the area since the failure occurred and we have not identified any other high or severe risk trees that needed to be treated
3161639 you combine that with the brittleness of the wood from it being so dry and the hardware in the tree that causes some decay and that what i think really happen here as to why that happen
3161640 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3161641 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3161642 these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august 6
3161643 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3161644 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3161645 i think it will be a number of years before they start paying taxes again
3161646 look at those losses they can carry them forward for a number of years

3161873 i think public safety really calls for morale in our police and fire departments to be good for our officers to feel supported respected to know that they are good enough
3161874 the argument for it is that occasionally its good to bring in some new blood and occasionally such as a number of years ago when we had the death of a police chief there may not be anybody ready for that

3161913 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3161914 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3161915 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3161916 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3161917 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of august 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3161918 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3161919 i guess my question is okay sure so its going to be reported but does america care at this point

3161990 positive growth in the hotel market is an ongoing trend during 2007 and for the second year in succession the sa hotel market as a whole experienced a double digit increase in revpar revenue per available room with 2007 up by a very impressive 16 3 percent compared to 2006 during 2007 and compared with the previous year 5 star hotels increased their revpar by 19 percent while the overall johannesburg revpar growth was 25 5 percent as quoted by the deloitte hotel and benchmark study
3161991 in the current year 2008 this positive trend is continuing at an increasing rate and we are seeing double digit revenue growth for the third year successive year with the sa hotel market as a whole again up by an outstanding 19 3 percent for the first six months ended 30 june 2008 compared with the same period in 2007 greater johannesburg is up by 25 7 percent with a record 36 1 percent increase for the hotels located at or tambo airport indicative of the fact that business is thriving in the hotel industry in south africa as a whole with no slow down on the horizon is the fact that the month of june 2008 reflected a healthy increase of 15 percent over june 2007
3161992 our outlook is extremely positive and for the first five months march july 2008 of our current financial year pgh has already achieved record turnover which is double that of the same period last year and we envisage it will represent triple growth by the end of the financial year
3161993 in addition we have been engaged by one of our south african clients protea hotels to assist with a variety of feasibility studies and facilitation for projects in which they are currently involved these include 43 new hotel projects which are at various stages and notably predominantly located in south africa
3161994 our role is to assist with the concept for topics compilation of the various discussion panels and in identifying suitable sponsorship an important element of this years conference is that it will be far more interactive with an emphasis on panel discussions and delegate participation
3161995 in response to our research questionnaire we have received replies from 160 hotels around the country representing 23 478 rooms in total and incorporating virtually all the major hotel operators and the outcome of this project will set the tone for an extremely interesting and revealing panel discussion with local and international industry experts importantly this panel will also be tasked with making suggestions as to how we can address the issue of increasing cost of capital and construction thereby improving return on investment

3162004 i am happy that the album bringing this change has my name but honestly i think its not possible to recover rs 13 5 crore from a soundtrack today maybe in the long run
3162005 based on our experience and understanding of the current market dynamics we believe we are in a position to monetise the music of singh is kinng not only in a true conventional way but also by creating newer avenues
3162006 i have always maintained that the buyer is more sensible than the seller and so when someone is paying rs 13 5 crore for a soundtrack and that too for a limited period seven years they know what they are doing
3162007 and as producers we never quite know what is the actual size of business of the music and home video industries so the person buying knows best
3162008 all the five songs are punjabi and i can assure you people would know me as pritam singh after the album comes out most of the songs are itemish in nature one being romantic and one slightly sad they have been sung by mika daler mehndi and neeraj shridhar bombay vikings
3162009 it was always coming and it has everything to do with the kind of success akshay is enjoying today he wasnt getting his commercial due and finally it has started rolling in yes it is also a recognition of hit combinations the combination of akshay and me aankhen waqt namastey london the combination of akshay and katrina humko deewana kar gaye namastey london welcome the combination of akshay and pritam bhool bhulaiyaa
3162010 i am not getting anything extra for the album being sold for rs 13 5 crore in fact i have spent way too much recording the album and am running at a loss
3162011 that is exactly why the music industry is not going to benefit despite such a record price the music director never gets his due
3162012 maybe if the album succeeds i will get many more good projects
3162013 we were looking first and foremost for someone who could truly embody the spirit of small town punjab and we know we have found her in anushka
3162014 and while she has no previous acting experience we have seen that unique spark in her that makes us confident that she will be a standout even opposite shah rukh

3162016 i have really worked hard for this role and sought a lot of information by reading books about how spies work
3162017 people taking staycations are not necessarily entertaining themselves at home
3162018 on the contrary many are participating in travel related activities that generate significant revenues for restaurants attractions theme parks as well as hotels and resorts
3162019 although staycations appear to be a real phenomenon the results of this survey suggest that their potential negative impact on the domestic travel industry will be far less than expected based on the extensive coverage this phenomenon has received in the press
3162020 we are delighted that brian binnie has confirmed his presentation is a perfect fit with the congress theme which will explore what new ideas are shaping informing changing and driving the 2020 agenda for tourism
3162021 21 st century guest expectations the mint on the pillow will not be enough

3162026 it was a breakaway glass bong but it was actually filled with water and so it had a little weight to it
3162027 while supporters like you are out knocking on doors registering new voters and organizing in your local communities our opponents are not even trying to match your efforts
3162028 instead theyre spending millions to spread the smear that barack is just a celebrity and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans
3162029 mccain is trying to undermine your hope and we can expect even more misleading attack ads in the weeks ahead
3162030 program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3162031 the mbta will reserve comment on the substance of the presentation until staff has had a sufficient period of time to thoroughly review the information and meet with the students and their professor
3162032 this is not simply saying we did it arent we inventive its also providing a tool to help accomplish this our understanding is that these would likely be software tools that would make it easier to analyze the cards
3162033 this result validates the prospect for economic production of pha polymer in switchgrass and demonstrates for the first time an important tool for enhancing switchgrass for value added performance as a bioenergy crop
3162034 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3162035 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
3162036 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable
3162037 but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
3162038 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach
3162039 moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals
3162040 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
3162041 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia
3162042 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
3162043 on request of the president of georgia the president of the republic of poland has provided the web site of the president of poland for dissemination of information
3162044 poti serves as a vital energy transit route to europe
3162045 over the past 48 hours russian forces have killed over 100 georgian civilians and soldiers after targeting residential complexes in georgia as well as airports bases and other vital infrastructure
3162046 it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3162047 we believe that legal errors were made in this decision and we have every reason to believe that the circuit court will look at them afresh and hopefully agree with us
3162048 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3162049 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3162050 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3162051 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3162052 in the event that the foreign courts uphold those rulings ebays going to have to change the way it does business
3162053 if they have the ability to prevent counterfeiting in france and germany then clearly they have the ability to prevent it in the united states
3162054 there are other online sites that have to realize that theyve got to up their game and do at least what ebay is doing if they want to insulate themselves from liability
3162055 die im freien wettbewerb immer zum wohle des konsumenten die preise nach unten und die qualit t nach oben steigern soll die gibt es in der realen marktwirtschaft einfach oftmals nicht sondern hier herrscht korruption lobbyismus und gezielter doller imperialismus

3162067 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on

3162094 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century he said in his strongest condemnation yet of the fighting
3162095 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said
3162096 the russians are staying near gori they did not enter the city itself
3162097 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardise russias relations with the united states and europe mr bush warned
3162098 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government he said
3162099 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush
3162100 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and would be

3162102 a very clean fuel when used in a fuel cell there is no emission of any pollutant and is only water vapor coming out of the pipe
3162103 it is a fuel cell vehicle takes the hydrogen from the fuel storage tank and oxygen from the air actually creates electricity as we drive and so its a pure electric vehicle but you refuel it with hydrogen rather than plugging it in
3162104 so lets say you have a car that is running today at typically 35 miles per gallon which is a pretty good car by market standard today the same car on fuel cell will do 70
3162105 we certainly have to do something with gasoline i really think this is the way to go

3162144 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3162149 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3162189 we had a guy from canada write us the other day and tell us how much he likes our web site and company overall i think weve had an enthusiastic response from people so far and were just having a lot of fun with it
3162190 if people see something they like on the web site and buy it we hope it may make them more aware of going green and encourage people to make more environmentally friendly choices in their life
3162191 in europe there isnt just a green movement its more of a green lifestyle
3162192 we have to ask ourselves is this stuff cool is this something people are going to want to buy

3162198 i think we will see a definite shift toward local foods and other ways to stretch the food dollar while still maintaining healthy meals for children
3162199 obviously if we can bring portion sizes down to a more appropriate level it will help tremendously with expenses
3162200 this is a great opportunity for schools to examine healthy portion sizes which not only improve the health of students but cut down on costs as well
3162201 districts will probably need to do more seasonal thinking when it comes to food choices
3162202 while fresh berries might be too expensive in the winter at some schools oranges or grapefruit might not

3162209 doctors dont know the exact cause of sarcoidosis although they think it may occur when your immune system overreacts to an unknown toxin drug or pathogen that enters your body through your airways when you breathe
3162210 its also possible that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing sarcoidosis which when combined with an environmental trigger produces the disease
3162211 black americans have a higher incidence of sarcoidosis than do white americans and although sarcoidosis affects white men and women about equally black women get the disease twice as often as black men do also sarcoidosis may be more severe in blacks and more likely to cause skin problems

3162217 i was outside with hary we were bored and headed outside to find something to play with we saw a man herding a few goats probably leading them to the grassy field near our house the goat herder pushed the goats to go faster and so one of the goats which had horns accidentally stepped on the tail of our dog pappy who was on the street taking a nap in the sun pappy shrieked in pain and surprise and instinctively i did not use this word in my original narration tried to bite the goat who of course tried his best to get away so pappy mad and growling at the goat was oblivious to the fact that the goat he was challenging had big horns suddenly the goat realizing that he was bigger than pappy started to chase after him pappy ran straight into our open garage past our kitchen and into our living room our helper who was cleaning up got the scare of her life as she saw what was coming at her and started yelling and running while hary me and the herder chased after pappy and the goat hahaha
3162218 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3162219 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3162220 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3162221 inconsistent with the assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo
3162222 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3162228 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
3162229 this loss of data clearly highlights an issue for businesses when sharing sensitive information with third parties
3162230 large organisations may feel confident in their own security practices but problems can arise when information is being shared with third parties who may not have implemented sufficient security settings
3162231 this loss of information would not have posed any kind of threat if the memory stick had been encrypted as a result of weak security procedures the stolen data has in fact provided valuable information with which to perpetrate both virtual and physical crime

3162291 until recently 85 per cent of the worlds tungsten was supplied by china

3162304 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character

3162347 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over
3162348 it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a paintful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous strugle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes seen not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it

3162372 we paid homage to that style that he did in the 60s and just brought it back in a more modern way with contemporary players
3162373 we call on the government to send a strong signal of its determination to protect the media by providing additional resources to the task force in charge of investigating attacks on journalists
3162374 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3162375 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3162376 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3162377 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3162378 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3162379 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3162380 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3162381 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3162382 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3162383 all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements re georgia fighting rages in s ossetia russian tanks head for battle
3162384 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3162385 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3162386 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3162387 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3162388 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their august 6 positions
3162389 furthermore in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3162390 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3162391 very regrettable that the attacks have happened after the cases of attacks against journalists have gone down last year
3162392 i do not understand why the killings continue this shows the prevalence of a culture of violence
3162393 the woman was very upset and had swelling over her left eye

3162398 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3162399 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3162400 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardise russias relations with the united states and europe
3162401 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3162402 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3162403 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia

3162407 the fsb believes that with a target in place efforts can be implemented to achieving the goal rather than discussing whether there should be one small businesses offer great value to communities and by using small businesses money is kept in the local economy
3162408 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the foreign affairs ministry
3162409 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organizations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
3162410 americans are awaiting a revolution now they say that they like it some are begging for it but unfortunately they forget that revolutions are bloody and fearful when there is a cooperative endeavor or a conspiracy to send a violent message that people are fed up with the way their government is running itself people are injured and some die others who are not in on the conspiracy become fearful of terrorism they demand protection to the point of sacrificing their freedoms revolution is where there is bloodshed and lives lost for an end result that benefits the revolutionaries the winners then spin tall tales of their truth that are told and retold in the annals of history and they are accepted as unquestionable facts
3162411 you can see how someone very good can be whittled down into someone who becomes very bad when there are unseen powers attacking him and those who associate with him powers that are trying to topple what it is that they have worked hard for when i am sorely troubled i ask questions and do soul searching for meaning i have dug a little deeper and bled a little redder and now i am beginning to reach that moment of clarity the clouds are parting and the veil is being lifted i must warn all those who are reading this article now that what you are reading is a therapeutic rebuking of all curses and renunciations i need to do this because there have been instances in my life lately that have convinced me that i am under attack this is more than a silencing or a cancellation of a show

3162525 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3162526 alan got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3162527 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife

3162531 lucky seemed confused but he was up and about eating normally
3162532 people have been wondering if the cows okay and where it was
3162533 maybe he thought someone would swim out and rescue him swimming over the boulders would be pretty hard i might end up with a broken leg coming through there
3162534 a 4 percent cap would be great it goes up every year we have assessors come out every year and check out property you do a little bit it goes up you do nothing it goes up
3162535 i would absolutely say yeah with the price of gas food and everything else going up we cant take the chance of losing our homes and everything else
3162536 i think it needs to be capped at less than 4 percent its way too high if capped at 4 percent they will go 4 percent every year no matter what
3162537 unless we do mandate relief at the same time we do capping ive said it for years capping a tax is not the answer we have to stop spending money like it grows all over our state federal and local municipalities the only way we will bring relief to tax payers is stop spending
3162538 the only way to control cost is to reduce spending which i have been doing for two years or have some relief of some type the percentage of 4 percent is going to help every person in new york state
3162539 everywhere everyones talking about i dont know how were going to pay for our fuel supply

3162554 the basic conclusion of mann et al 1998 1999 was that the late 20th century warmth in the northern hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1 000 years this conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes
3162555 the 1990s are likely the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in at least a millennium
3162556 a search for some basis on which to discredit these particular scientists and findings rather than a search for understanding
3162557 an act to amend the employment standards act to provide for an employee wage protection program
3162558 i am reminded when reading climate audit of certain evasive tactics used by squid
3162559 the weight of current multi proxy evidence therefore suggests greater 20th century warmth in comparison with temperature levels of the previous 400 years than was shown in the tar on the evidence of the previous and four new reconstructions that reach back more than 1 kyr it is likely that the 20th century was the warmest in at least the past 1 3 kyr considering the recent instrumental and longer proxy evidence together it is very likely that average nh temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were higher than for any other 50 year period in the last 500 years greater uncertainty associated with proxy based temperature estimates for individual years means that it is more diffi cult to gauge the significance or precedence of the extreme warm years observed in the recent instrumental record such as 1998 and 2005 in the context of the last millennium
3162560 i would say if you are unwilling to investigate the issues then i can understand your viewpoint and appeal to authority of the climate scientists but as someone who has looked in great detail at the problem at hand including writing my own code to replicate parts of the processes and independently test some claims i can say that the issues mcintyre raises are valid and relevant i can only suggest that if you have a genuine interest in the topic that you do similar yourself
3162561 also that paper depends on calculations from the following paper to be valid
3162562 doug clover your only so called argument seems to be the appeal to authority
3162563 you earlier stated that te ipcc had dismissed mann et al i provided a reference that proved that statement wrong
3162564 you then replied with the quote i have copied above which is that a scientifically peered review of the climate science with actual references to the science itself is just assertion and argument from authority if that is what you think you dont understand science or the scientific process i conlcude you are not a scientist or trained in science and therefore unqualified to make that judgement
3162565 its still in the full report buried deep down but its not in the summary for policy makers and the public that 99 99 people will read mann himself contested this furiously and called it a smack to his face check the review process
3162566 if you assert that mann et al are right even if they have convincingly been proven wrong and that they are right because their work when it was approved before it was shown to be full of errors was peer reviewed and that the refutation does not count because it was not
3162567 high resolution palaeoclimatic records for the last millennium interpretation integration and comparison with general circulation model control run temperatures

3162570 low frequency signals in long tree ring chronologies for reconstructing past temperature variability
3162571 merging information from different resources for new insights into climate change in the past and future
3162572 highly variable northern hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low and high resolution proxy data
3162573 i used to be a scientist and firm believer in evolution until i started to see the truth behind the research
3162574 steve mcintyre has successfully published controversial views in peer reviewed climatology journals either he got lucky or he has some insight which has eluded climate scientists up to now
3162575 i never said that steve couldnt be wrong in fact i mentioned an error in one of his publications above which was corrected and found not to affect the results my comment was in response to a claim steve wasnt a climate scientist one definition of a scientist is that they are actively publishing you have taken my comment out of context and distorted it into a strange absolute that had nothing to do with the original discussion please dont do that
3162576 flame wars and exchaning personal insults doesnt interest me ichthyic this after having said you sound mentally ill moses seriously my condolences i advice you to seek therapy for this condition liar
3162577 if id have been wrong one would have been enough
3162578 thadd your interest in exactly what determines a scientist seems irrelevant to the discussion it is an argument to the person ad hominem not the substance of the issue at hand i see no point in arguing over the semantics of what you or i think makes a scientist if youve got a substantive evidence based point to make about the data or the analysis go ahead and ask otherwise i think weve just reached a dead end here
3162579 you cant resist reaching for the ad hominems yourself its obviously an affliction
3162580 bs youre not arguing about the data youre casting aspersions about the type of argumentation used you could actually try arguing about the data the methodology and the safety of the conclusions based upon them that would be scientific and reasonable what isnt reasonable is to claim that opinion is not valid because insert anti science crackpot here uses similar argumentation thats just ad hominem
3162581 steve mcintyre has successfully published controversial views in peer reviewed climatology journals
3162582 it thus leads almost by necessity to the realisation that our attempts to see and to find the truth are not final but open to improvement our knowledge our doctrine is conjectural that it consists of guesses of hypothesis rather than that of final and certain truths and that criticism and critical discussion are our only means of getting nearer to the truth it thus leads to the tradition of bold conjectures and of free criticism the tradition that created the rational or scientific attitude and with it our western civilisation the only civilisation which is based upon science
3162583 hilarious i made a factual statement steve has published in peer reviewed journals that is a fact i made no suggestion that this makes his work right that is something you have invented that is a straw man attack your subsequent linking to id etc is a guilt by association fallacy built on a straw man sheesh a high schooler could see the failure of logic you are building on here
3162584 remember this is a poll about blogs and some of the responses seemed to only be interested in addressing the blog posts i wanted to make it clear that steve mcintyre has done rather more than just blog perhaps everyone already knew that and it was unnecessary i thought it better to clarify
3162585 it was the professional geologists who dismissed alfred wegeners continental drift theory not on the data but on the grounds that wegener was an astronomer by training and not a geologist
3162586 im not asking you to accept my endorsement im suggesting since you obviously care about the topic enough to post on this thread that you investigate the issue in detail like i did i assumed it would be wrong i was surprised to find it was excellent work why check my code my code is just double checking the original code why not just go to the original code direct it makes considerably more sense is more efficient and easier the link is above thats what i did but no rather than investigate the claims with an open mind youd rather just go on and on and on about a claim that i never made about peer reviewed literature given your failure to follow simple logic in a blog im not sure you would be capable of understanding the issues at hand anyway why are all of you guys so scared of investigating steves work in detail ive put the code up tell us whats wrong with it or would the resulting cognitive dissonance be too painful to bear
3162587 when pointing out rudeness fails to change another persons behaviour i like to retaliate in kind
3162588 i care when someone keeps claiming that i made an inference that i did not make it is sad to see it come from someone who would claim to be a scientist
3162589 i have developed a bias against scientists who write outside their field e g mathematicians and engineers tackling biology
3162590 1 science is a process and is self correcting over time through the process of peer review in this case mcintyre found some minor errors in manns paper and corrected them he also found an error in some nasa data and that was corrected these are as far as i know mcintyres total positive contribution to the process
3162591 well thanks for those scintillating insights your comment has really raised the bar for everyone here im sure
3162592 science is a process and is self correcting over time through the process of peer review
3162593 yes nasa made a small error yes mann made a small error neither of these errors makes a great difference in our current paradigm
3162594 i want to take your software and see if it does what it says it does how its said to be done
3162595 can you show me a formula showing that a doubling of co2 leads to 2 5 degrees c
3162596 im not interested talking politics or reading arguments about thermodynamics
3162597 why are the proxies youre relying on not archived and havent been updated for over 20 years
3162598 the nas panel report strongly recommending against the use of stripbark trees such as the bristlecone pines used in nearly every study
3162599 in the hands of steve mcintyre this statement becomes proof that such samples cannot be used for any reconstructions when i challenged him on this and the source that the nas statement was based on he eventually abandoned using the nas statement and suddenly changed the argument
3162600 such record is not a reliable temperature proxy for the last 150 years as it shows an increasing trend in about 1850 that has been attributed to atmospheric co2 fertilization graybill and idso 1993
3162601 abandoned using the nas statement and suddenly changed the argument
3162602 the nas panels statement was based on biondi et als concern about using them for reconstructions after about 1850
3162603 nas forgot to mention the 150 years part and its restatement out of context gets quoted over and over again
3162604 2 the nas panel agreed that strip bark sites which include all the relevant bristlecone foxtail and even a couple of limber pine sites should be avoided in temperature reconstructions for a variety of reasons
3162605 2 we have no instrumental data in the area older than 150 years biondi says not to use bristlecone proxies post 1850 perhaps you can explain how we can use the earlier pre 1850 portions of the bristlecone record as temperature proxies when we have no instrumental data pre 1850 to either calibrate or validate them against
3162606 i dont know anything about ca or steve mcintyre but
3162607 the possibility that increasing tree ring widths in modern times might be driven by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations
3162608 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3162609 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future
3162610 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization this decision is the right one for the organization

3162718 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3162719 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3162720 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3162721 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3162722 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3162723 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3162724 just so you all know we did set a record
3162725 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3162726 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3162727 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3162728 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3162729 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
3162730 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3162731 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3162732 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3162733 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3162734 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3162735 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3162736 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3162737 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3162738 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3162739 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3162740 i have told you about my current trading is in the short term and with small positions until the crop becomes clear to me that is what i am doing by reducing my trade until i feel the market is stable which at this time i feel is not i trade small in these times to stay unemotional and be able to think clearly
3162741 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3162742 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3162743 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3162744 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3162745 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3162746 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3162747 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3162748 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3162749 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3162750 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3162751 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3162752 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3162753 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3162754 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3162755 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3162756 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3162757 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3162758 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3162759 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3162760 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3162761 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3162762 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3162763 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3162764 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3162765 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3162766 bernie mac dead barrage of responses bordering on conspiracy theories
3162767 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3162768 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3162769 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3162770 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3162771 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3162772 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3162773 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3162774 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3162775 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3162776 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag
3162777 every morning it was raised and reminded me of what a great nation i come from i hope this flag also brings you and your class the joy and contentment it has brought me
3162778 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3162779 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3162780 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3162781 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3162782 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3162783 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3162784 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3162785 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3162786 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3162787 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3162788 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3162789 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3162790 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3162791 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3162792 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3162793 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3162794 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3162795 provided a 30 fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea ice zone
3162796 the major fronts to be mapped south of 60 s and sea ice formation rates to be inferred from changes in upper ocean salinity
3162797 elephant seals fill a blind spot in our sampling coverage
3162798 enabling the establishment of a truly global ocean observing system
3162799 their purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of georgia
3162800 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3162801 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3162802 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3162803 i know nothing about any plan to block the shipments
3162804 in fact the fact that ships are being stopped and searched does not mean there is a blockade
3162805 it was a tight match that could have gone either way
3162806 but maybe that was because they were returning the ball so well
3162807 we were not surprised by their opponents performance because daniel had played them in the first round in toronto and he warned me
3162808 there was no doubt he wanted to redeem himself for that defeat
3162809 i had an injection to numb it before the match
3162810 i will rest a bit but i hope to compete in the u s open
3162811 el gobierno no gasta lo que no tiene gasta lo que puede
3162812 obamas campaign has hit a soft patch this summer with november just three months off it still appears an obama outcome in massachusetts is not in question but the margin certainly is
3162813 in presidential politics color new york state blue and throw away the crayons
3162814 oklahomans have their minds made up and they arent going to change come hell or high water no matter what
3162815 alaskans for obama a rare democratic push on the last frontier
3162816 obama and mccain are doing equally well in raiding the other partys base ten percent of 2004 kerry voters favor mccain while 13 percent of 2004 bush backers are with obama in order to close the gap mccain needs to do a little bit better winning back the democrats who voted for ronald reagan and their children
3162817 it would take an exceptional turnout from young voters and black voters as well as a lot of disaffected conservatives voting for bob barr
3162818 e io faccio una preghiera e la ripeter finch la mia lingua si secchi catherine earnshaw possa tu non trovare mai riposo fin chio vivo tu dici che io ti ho uccisa
3162819 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
3162820 sai nana in mezzo a qualunque folla io mi trovi in qualunque forma tu appaia
3162821 in december 2006 anti racism rally organiser jonathan starling stepped in after portuguese activist robert pires angrily approached the podium after speaker former senator calvin smith made controversial comments and was heckled mr starling asked mr smith to finish his speech
3162822 prude how the sex obsessed culture hurts young women and america too
3162823 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic
3162824 we asked for savings ideas from 20 markets they came back to us with numbers
3162825 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3162826 we dont expect that ever to have to be paid
3162827 republic will look at this as another hostile takeover bid and attempt to convince shareholders and its board that the allied deal provides the best growth opportunity
3162828 i did 21 death penalty cases either as the lead or on a team
3162829 upon reflection leon dorsey is probably no 1 as the meanest criminal i prosecuted
3162830 thats over and done with i could have came in here and been oh im sorry im so bad but i dont feel like that thats not being honest with myself
3162831 we had to convince the jury hed be a continuing danger and he more than satisfied that in prison
3162832 ive done cut folks ive done stabbed folks ive killed folks
3162833 my boyfriend and i went here last night for dinner
3162834 greek salad with gyro meat and pita on the side
3162835 oppa na ma ba ra bwa ba ppa keu loh keh ba ppa
3162836 my idea of heaven tastes like a trevisana from fornino
3162837 you get what you get and you dont throw a fit
3162838 id like a coffee cake and a small iced coffee please
3162839 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3162840 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3162841 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3162842 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3162843 pink berry stole my idea and is getting rich from it
3162844 i have the lucrative ability to use the power of sand to transform cheap cans of evil into expensive cans of peace and goodwill
3162845 get off that its a girls bike you ride the one i bought you
3162846 its too big i fell and cut my legs this one is better
3162847 i dont care if you want to ride a bike you ride this one that is a girls bike its your choice ride a boys bike or dont ride at all
3162848 gyu kaku is a terrible place to take a date if said date hates delicious food drinks and fun
3162849 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3162850 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3162851 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3162852 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3162853 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3162854 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3162855 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3162856 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3162857 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3162858 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3162859 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3162860 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3162861 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3162862 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3162863 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3162864 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3162865 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3162866 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3162867 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3162868 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3162869 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3162870 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3162871 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3162872 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3162873 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3162874 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3162875 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3162876 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3162877 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3162878 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3162879 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3162880 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3162881 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3162882 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3162883 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3162884 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3162885 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3162886 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3162887 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3162888 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3162889 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3162890 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3162891 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3162892 for those who appreciate dude speak and bozo humour this is a very funny film
3162893 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3162894 you could tell from my reaction that it was fun
3162895 i definitely dont think ive ever sort of celebrated that much after a race in my life
3162896 its the one time he gets to really be a part of something
3162897 we were talking this morning back in the village about that race was better than the 800 free in athens
3162898 as a whole five of the teams broke the world record if you think about it we broke the world record by four seconds and won by eight one hundredths of a second
3162899 going up there with four guys but youre really one we all have to swim the perfect race we swam that perfect race this morning
3162900 the typical damage in this instance would be cracked interior or plaster or drywall glass and potentially even contents that are damaged as a result of shifting
3162901 its the impact of the explosion and then the resulting damage that comes from the impact
3162902 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3162903 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3162904 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3162905 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3162906 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3162907 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3162908 if theres a chance to win everybody wants to win on that field
3162909 thats what we work for thats what we work for out at practice we dont work just to kind of go through the motions i want to practice winning for me as a head coach its not like im gritting my teeth and punching guys and grabbing guys and shaking guys or anything like that its just that i like to win and i think every coach does so every coach is out there to win regardless of who he has on the field
3162910 i wanted to run a screen down there we picked one out and i was kind of excited about it
3162911 i just felt it was a very good play and it was executed well they all have to be executed it would have been a very crummy play had we not executed well
3162912 when we look at the video and youre executing everybodys executing the plays have a real good chance of being successful its when youre not executing that disaster happens for the most part we are executing what were setting out to do
3162913 if you just stay on one side with taylor you have a plan
3162914 you get your back going that way all day to help chip block you help the tackle out that has to block him all day you slide the line that way you can make plans
3162915 there were a couple of plays during the week that i said when i get here im calling this play and its going to be successful when i call it and it sort of happened it did it happened
3162916 and it wasnt anything that we were looking at on video and identified a weakness in buffalos defense it was just that if we execute this play then this could be a big play for us a couple of those happened
3162917 did get accomplished what we wanted to as far as seeing the players in the first two games
3162918 we executed our game plan i didnt come up with new plays because i wanted to be competitive to win i just used the sheet that we went into the game with we did get to call and see a lot of the things that we wanted to find out
3162919 the thing that i really was impressed with jason last night was that he had two pocket scrambles he was in the pocket scrambled in the pocket and bought time then drilled the ball very accurately those are things im looking for weve been drilling those things he made a couple of plays that were big league plays that way
3162920 there was a guy open in front he should have hit or turn that down all together and go elsewhere we were all disappointed in that it really created an opportunity for them to get back in the game and that put our defense in our real bind we have to improve
3162921 in order to fetch all families that wish to come back
3162922 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3162923 it was bad for the arctic but very very good for mapping
3162924 afgaande op uitlatingen van al qaeda en de jihadistische unie zijn we er zeker van dat er besluiten zijn genomen om aanvallen uit te voeren in duitsland
3162925 i am talking to lawyers to figure out how to make our way ahead we have to decide what to do whether to file an appeal or file a separate public interest litigation pil before the supreme court as the issue concerns women and families all over india he said
3162926 grave abnormalities said a couple of people with children who were born with severe deformities as the foetal malformations were detected late have come forward to join him in the legal fight
3162927 there is one woman from kolkata who called me and said she was eager to chip in
3162928 we usually advise sonography for pregnant women in the 18 19th week
3162929 born alive living for no more than a few hours usually the foetus does not survive the procedure say experts
3162930 to spooks what torchwood is to doctor who ie not as good
3162931 we cannot implement the pay raises without an appropriation but more importantly i am of the opinion that this is no time for pay raises
3162932 to take positive action on legislation that has been sent to him by the general assembly
3162933 enormous fear and misinformation and a vested interest in exaggerated stories about drugs to keep prohibition alive
3162934 lsd was no hustler from a shotgun lab in tijuana after all but a bourgeois revolutionary born into establishment medicine and able to travel the world and enter societies from the top down through their most hallowed institutions
3162935 we talk about the veterans suffering ptsd but its really a culture wide phenomenon
3162936 were at a place where technology and the structure of contemporary life have taken us so far away from our emotions as to create pathological conditions the systemic violence and selfishness and greed that are in our society need treatment
3162937 is what makes them uniquely effective they allow negative ideas and feelings where most addictions have their origins to surface into consciousness with the guidance of a mental health professional the person can let them go

3162947 i am pleased that these four men have accepted responsibility for their actions and will be punished accordingly
3162948 the men and women who investigated this case should be commended for the hard work and long hours spent brining these defendants to justice

3162950 our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance
3162951 explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult i suppose i hoped by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the storys readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives

3162956 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3162957 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3162958 if mothers who lack resources such as education marital stability income and healthy environments do not receive support to breastfeed the health and well being gap between children born to women with resources and those born to disadvantaged mothers will only widen
3162959 in the case of patients who use proton pump inhibitors this equilibrium
3162960 should be reconsidered with knowledge of the mounting yet incomplete evidence suggesting that proton pump inhibitors increase the risk of fracture
3162961 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable

3162967 do you sit around a lot because of a lack of energy
3162968 when elderly patients complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old
3162969 they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
3162970 unraveling the causes of anergia will expand the scope of geriatric interventions that enable aging persons to preserve their quality of life
3162971 we get an overview that we cant get through the community health centres
3162972 this can provide information back on priority areas for the future
3162973 if i live in paulatuk and i see this ship coming in the technology is coming to me rather than i have to go to inuvik down to yellowknife down to edmonton to have access to these services
3162974 i would feel a sense of responsibility to come in and say i want to take part in this survey
3162975 its not enough to talk about we have high incidents of violence we have high incidence of people developing diabetes we have high incidents of sexually transmitted diseases this will be the foundation to begin to make changes
3162976 we wanted to make sure that the website reflected all of the latest data and information that was available about this topic
3162977 i think the emphasis in the earlier text was a little strong todays vehicles are more efficient when it comes to smog emissions
3162978 our concern is that municipal decision making must be based on facts and scientific evidence
3162979 and we were seeing some municipalities that were focusing on the health impacts of idling based on information that was incorrect and misleading
3162980 what i would like to see is that natural resources canada put the same amount of emphasis on these other driving behaviours that they do on idling
3162981 its gonna make it harder for every city politician to make the argument that we need to have restrictive legislation on idling its not good news for cities anywhere
3162982 shes gone but we want the case against her owner to go forward
3162983 there is no requirement that the animal be alive to move forward with the cruelty charges
3162984 we continue to expand our product offerings and to invest in our existing products
3162985 we believe we can continue to grow through this economic downturn it would be shortsighted of us to stop development of new projects instead we remain focused on growing dealertrack by providing our customers with the solutions they need to be more efficient
3162986 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3162987 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3162988 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3162989 our more favorable view might come as a surprise to some
3162990 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3162991 this is the moment when the rising of the oceans began to slow and our climate began to heal
3162992 yes those damn bitches should keep their mouths shut stay in the kitchen and make phone calls for obama damn them they shouldnt be angry because the chosen one and his campaign ran the most anti feminist and dirty campaign in modern history against hillary clinton they should be grateful the great obama is willing to take their support they have become a distraction and need to shut up
3162993 buried for anything that makes diggers think they are important
3162994 coordinated bury activity is not technically a violation of diggs tos

3163003 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3163004 they have 95 counties to work and few days to do it so its a hurried thing

3163016 where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion
3163017 law as a guide to conduct is reduced to the level of mere futility if it is unknown and unknowable

3163033 a emo o bateu quando vi na tela o logo da walt disney studios e o desenho do castelo m gico s naquele momento percebi que era o protagonista de um daqueles filmes que assistia quando era crian a quando sonhava em ser ator

3163042 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3163043 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3163044 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3163045 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement

3163055 i am saying to the boys to handle what we have got to do next week which is to go to canberra and play
3163056 i think we would need to improve on what we did tonight i think thats the understatement of the year
3163057 obviously i think we can play much better and we are going to need to play better in the coming weeks
3163058 i think the few sides we have got obviously starting with canberra next week are playing really well at the moment
3163059 following the match against argentina on saturday bakkies botha had a scan and he has ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
3163060 we will adopt a conservative management process which means bakkies will not undergo surgery but will rather complete a rehabilitation process
3163061 fourie had a head clash with the argentina wing a scan has shown he has a depressed fracture of his cheekbone and he will undergo surgery before the end of the week which means he will be out for six weeks post surgery
3163062 both players will be unavailable for the remainder of the tri nations and we hope that bakkies will be ready in time for the end of year tour to the uk
3163063 i could not have asked any more from the boys
3163064 if we play like we played this week we can beat australia the key is to turn up like we did this week in every game
3163065 thats going to be a very interesting series one im really going to watch closely
3163066 hopefully we can keep everybody fit for australia and if we can round off the season with a win that would be great
3163067 but this one is the one that has meant most to us
3163068 we have waited a long time for this moment we came here with a goal in mind and that was to win the series and we are really chuffed to have done it

3163073 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3163074 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3163075 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3163076 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3163077 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3163078 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police
3163079 this is the best period in history in terms of education medical care and religion

3163097 i explained how the so called enemy the viet cong and the north vietnamese were actually the legitimate parties and how the u s presence was illegal immoral and unwise i supplied him with reams of documentation
3163098 this was an extraordinary thing for someone who had until recently held a top secret clearance to say to anyone least of all to someone who still had a clearance
3163099 i asked him if he knew where we could find a xerox machine
3163100 and within an hour he got back to me with the word that his then girlfriend had a machine in her office we could use
3163101 a real patriot of this country someone who fought for right and justice
3163102 the fact is i will be eternally grateful to tony for his courage and partnership in what proved to be a useful action
3163103 he set an example of willingness to risk everything for his country and for the vietnam that he loved that very few unfortunately have emulated
3163104 every sort of legal challenge that could spring into the creative mind of a lawyer has been brought
3163105 time after time courts have said that it is not unreasonable to regulate dress and grooming
3163106 his dad is of native american descent so we have chosen to raise him with certain beliefs in place one of them being that his hair is sacred and we dont cut it
3163107 what is their religious belief that defies cutting hair and following our policies
3163108 they have not produced any information except they are native american indians
3163109 i would consider it pretty much a rural community with the basic tenets and beliefs that go with that
3163110 religion is probably one of the few or only areas where students are going to be afforded a greater protection
3163111 the students have better attendance have better disciplinary behavior and it has alleviated tension among students who might be distracted by dress
3163112 where does the religious tenet come from is it an organized religion or a personal set of beliefs
3163113 it would just teach our son that it is easier to roll over and do what youre told and not stand up for your rights
3163114 the sundancers are making a commitment to this way of life
3163115 all of this is community building the sundancers are all working together the camp is all working together were all one cohesive group
3163116 and so for us especially in this time of global warming over consumption and using all of our natural resources its time for us to learn to live with the earth and not just on the earth
3163117 without that movement we wouldnt have a lot of what we have now
3163118 when we formed we knew we had to have a spiritual movement

3163127 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3163128 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3163129 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3163130 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3163131 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3163132 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3163133 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3163134 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3163135 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3163155 my husbands in iraq and right now i just wanted to show support for the family
3163156 whether youre republican democrat or independent it doesnt matter you need to be here and show support for your country and for a young man who gave his life
3163157 i feel very very sad that such a wonderful young man has been killed he was a wonderful son and a wonderful patriot
3163158 you have to show your support theres few ways i can and this is one way i knew i could and it felt so good
3163159 he gave the ultimate sacrifice his own life we wanted to show the family that we support them and grieve with them
3163160 a lot of people over there are in danger we need to stop putting it in the backs of our minds and we need to remember
3163161 they asked me if it ever got better i had to respond it will be different not better they have to redefine what normal will be for them now
3163162 his sacrifice is the same as our sons and its the right thing to do were so proud of him hell be missed too

3163181 but in high school no one ever talked about college to me high school counselors for the most part dont know who you are dont think you can do it
3163182 there are so many people who have lived here for 20 years and are not citizens
3163183 theyre in the middle not from here and not from there a lot of them dont go to college because of the cost
3163184 the work they mifn do is important because they help people become more educated about the immigration issues and what its like to be an immigrant
3163185 they help get our voices out there we may not have a vote but we have a voice
3163186 everybodys eating salsa not only eating it but dancing it immigrants have revived lake street we make sure everythings running we cook in the kitchens and clean and work in the yards
3163187 we dont want people to get caught up in the myopic conversation about how we are a nation of laws those are harmful ideologies that are not about bringing people together
3163188 one of the primary reasons people want to immigrate here is that we are a nation of laws
3163189 unlike many areas of the world our legal systems have a high degree of integrity we cannot maintain a generous legal immigration system by excusing widespread illegal immigration
3163190 we do talk about immigration but i really think its more about the organization reaching out to youth and getting people engaged in their communities
3163191 the activities are all about trying to get students to talk about issues at the school and in their lives what their dreams were
3163192 this kind of work is not just some altruistic thing it makes their the students own lives richer
3163193 it takes away fear a lot of my students were afraid to go to lake street opens doors expands their world vision radically changes their lives
3163194 you want to get them to understand that the immigration story relates to all of us but mostly you tell them whatever you have to share share

3163203 rusia ha invadido a un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr ticamente elegido por sus ciudadanos una acci n as es inaceptable en el siglo xxi
3163204 el gobierno ruso tiene que respetar la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia el gobierno ruso tiene que revertir el curso en el que parece que est y aceptar este acuerdo de paz como primer paso hacia la resoluci n del conflicto
3163205 acciones de rusia esta semana han generado serias dudas sobre sus intenciones en georgia y la regi n estas acciones han da ado sustancialmente la posici n de rusia en el mundo
3163206 esas acciones ponen en riesgo las relaciones de rusia con eeuu y europa es hora de que rusia cumpla con su palabra y actuar para poner fin a la crisis
3163207 hay evidencia de que las fuerzas rusas podr an comenzar pronto a bombardear el aeropuerto civil en la capital
3163208 si estas informaciones son ciertas estas acciones rusas representar an una dram tica y brutal escalada del conflicto en georgia

3163224 it is more similar to strains previously identified in europe italy asia afghanistan and the middle east iran in 2007
3163225 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3163226 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3163227 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3163228 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

3163258 the law simply provides that persons with georgia firearms licenses may carry guns in public transportation
3163259 this court must construe the law according to the ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute the court cannot rely on what legislators say they intended when the words of the statute do not clearly express that intention the common and ordinary meaning of the words public transportation does not include airports therefore the court finds that plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the law permits them to carry guns in airports
3163260 even if the law clearly did apply to airports defendants have raised a serious question as to whether the law would be preempted by federal law following sept 11 congress created the transportation security administration and gave it sweeping regulatory authority over safety and security at domestic airports under our constitution federal law is supreme if congress has occupied the field of airport safety and security then georgia cannot interfere with congress regulatory scheme by creating a right that would allow people to carry guns in airports
3163261 whether its a crime for people with georgia firearms licenses or gfls to carry firearms in unsterile areas of the airport it is not
3163262 it is unreasonable to arrest someone whose behavior is not a crime
3163263 there is no law prohibiting it if there is no crime against carrying a gun in the airport for the defendants to arrest someone is a violation of their constitutional rights there is no burden for them the city and airport personnel to follow the constitution
3163264 the public interest weighs in favor of hewing to the status quo
3163265 it is not for the georgia legislature to draw a line in this building the airport terminal and say this is where you can have a gun this is where you cant have a gun
3163266 under federal statute an airport operator serves a single master its the federal government not the georgia legislature
3163267 this is something they have not been able to do since at least 1976
3163268 it will not cause plaintiffs any irreparable harm if this state of affairs is allowed to continue until this court has the chance to issue a final decision on the merits of plaintiffs claims
3163269 if licensed gun owners are allowed to carry their weapons into the airport defendants would have to substantially alter their security procedures to take this into account these necessary changes would not only have a significant adverse impact they would also make the airport less safe law enforcement officers would be forced to monitor the activities of individuals carrying guns instead of focusing on other potential threats thus increasing the risk to the traveling public
3163270 the only requirements to obtain a firearms license in georgia are to pay a 15 fee and undergo a criminal background check and at the discretion of the probate court a mental health background check
3163271 there is no requirement that applicants demonstrate any proficiency in the handling of a firearm this hardly assures that all persons obtaining a license pose no threat
3163272 there can be no doubt that the public has a substantial interest in safe air travel
3163273 where there is any question as to whether the public safety and welfare is threatened the court must rule on the side of that public interest here the evidence demonstrates at the very least that there is a significant question as to whether permitting the carrying of guns in the airport poses a serious threat to the public safety and welfare

3163293 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3163294 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch

3163305 jesus did not simply accept the outcasts he changed them yes he touched the leper but that touch healed him yes he ate with the prostitutes and tax collectors who were notoriously dishonest but he didnt encourage them to be better prostitutes and more proficient tax collectors he transformed their lives and brought them to repentance romans 1 18 19 english american standard version 1901 asv 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hinder the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which is known of god is manifest in them for god manifested it unto them wp bible plugin king james version for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them as much as we want to believe that god is a god of love if we are honest about the scriptures and do a thorough study of the bible we find that he is also a god of judgment and he doesnt grade on a curve god does not like sin he doesnt say if you skate by i dont care as we read his word we see that if he does not like it he has no room for it and will not stand for it he loves the sinner yes he doesnt love however the sin or the continue committing of the sin sin is considered fundamentally an offense against him and he does and will punish sin there is no all will be saved so just keep on sinning there is redemption from the sin stop committing the sin and grow in his grace there will be those who has accepted christ as their lord and savior and those who made the free will choice of didnt saying he isnt doesnt change what is in the bible and leaves a person in one of two positions either you believe in the bible or you dont if you dont believe in the bible youre not a christian there is no other way t o it because being a christian means being a follower of christ and his word and belief in him and his word not just bits and parts of his word that makes us feel good and not convicted if we feel convicted maybe because deep down we know its not right in the eyes of god why do you call me lord lord and not do what i tell you everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them i will show you what he is like he is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock and when a flood arose the stream broke against that house and could not shake it because it had been well built but the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation when the stream broke against it immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
3163306 behold he struck the rock so that waters gushed out and streams were overflowing can he give bread also will he provide meat for his people
3163307 do not suppose that i have come to bring peace to the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
3163308 but i tried not to show him i got very very happy that he approached
3163309 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3163310 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3163311 most people are familiar with 20 20 vision and do not realize that the limit of human vision is 20 08 many elite athletes see better than 20 20 which is not surprising since the superior demands of competition require their visual systems to perform at the highest level
3163312 at every level of competition vision is emerging as an area that athletes can develop to improve their performance the technology in the achievevision program allows us to measure vision beyond that 20 20 mark and assess the different visual skills needed in each sport this is a breakthrough that means we can customize vision care for each athlete those who see exceptionally well and those who need basic vision correction and incorporate it into their training
3163313 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3163314 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives
3163315 expectant motherhood is an exciting thing but it can also be very hectic and stressful
3163316 what we put together for ms presley was a combination of pre natal vitamins and non toxic eco friendly skincare products that would be safe for both she and her twins additionally we invited her to visit us for a complimentary pregnancy massage great for eliminating pre birth stressors and toxins as well as our popular pure pregnancy facial customized to meet the specific needs of her skin
3163317 what we do is take a well rounded approach that offers moms to be and new mothers a chance to indulge while doing something that is good for them both inside and out
3163318 we are pleased and encouraged by the reserve increases in all categories as a result of our last drilling operations we have established proved reserves our proved plus probable reserves 2p have increased by 1 770 and our proved plus probable plus possible 3p reserves by over 534 the combined reserves have increased from 1 477 to 5 307 mmboe and are consistent with our strategy of growing the resource base of the company this reserve growth positions us well to take advantage of the current strong developing market for heavy oil
3163319 the drilling activity and results from the drilling program were on plan as well as in line with expectations that management had set out at the beginning of the program

3163326 im sure thats the number one thing on his mind right now
3163327 i dont know if theyre going to take precaution and make me sit but i hate missing practice ive never missed practice its frustrating and it was awkward for me very awkward yesterday and the only thing i can do is go back and try and go back out there today
3163328 ive never been on the outside like that watching practice and im going to do whatever i can to make sure that doesnt happen again
3163329 i didnt even want to come out but the referee made me come out because i was bleeding
3163330 everybody in this sport takes care of themselves gets massages eats right and does all those things but a lot of times for o linemen injuries happen when youre at the wrong place at the wrong time fortunately for me that hasnt happened and im not going to start thinking about that now ill be back im not worried it was just frustrating yesterday and thats it
3163331 they just go out and work work work i hate to say it because theyll take it the wrong way but they are the classic group of over achievers they work very well together they are tough kids they play hard and theyre always out there david is certainly the embodiment of that effort hes just there whatever you ask him to do whatever position you have he says okay coach and hes got a smile on his face going about his business hes very prepared and very professional about it and when hes not there you obviously take notice because it doesnt happen very often
3163332 you certainly would prefer to have all of your starters our there getting the repetitions they need in order to get themselves into game ready shape but from the standpoint of the quarterback eli manning is at least able to see the different coverages it also provides an opportunity for some of the young guys to step up and become contributors this year we were anxious to see if the young guys would be able to take what they did in practice and bring it to the game we were encouraged by what we saw its not the ideal way you design it but i think were making the best of it the offensive line running backs tight ends and quarterbacks are at least getting all of the work in that they need the receivers are also doing it as well its just not with the normal starters
3163333 hes one of the guys that have kind of stood out hes done an especially good job
3163334 hes really one of the guys that i was referring to we saw him on a fairly consistent basis in practice making plays and getting open making some good catches growing in his confidence of the position i was actually anxious to see if it would translate to the game and i thought it did i thought he made some good plays were looking forward to seeing if he can continue to make progress its never a problem to have good players i promise you well find spots for him if he continues to play the way he has the problem is the other thing when you dont have enough good players
3163335 there have been flashes and i think youll see some moments when youll say
3163336 hes had some more surgery on his arm but as always his spirit is tremendous his message is always weaved around basically the same type of thing and this message was about when he went to iraq as many times hes been at the front no matter what war it was his concern was many times for the guys that have been there were they as focused did they thing it was a blueprint of the same experience they had just had or maybe an earlier experience they had just had he was more concerned with making sure those people were focused one of the things that seeps into my frustration is your expectation level is so high your expectation level can be high but its going to take some time when you look at the mixture ands the different people that are involved before the precision is as sharp as you want it to be i thought the message fit
3163337 you get something done every day thats the approach you have to take
3163338 thats the approach you have to take its not the way i had planned it we were going to have this jog through tomorrow morning and then go tomorrow night we were ready to practice today but what we did was flip it it would be great if it all works out to where we can practice twice tomorrow but the weather forecast here has not been good we have to deal with it now we cant worry about that in order to get the best that we possibly could out of being inside i flipped the practices this was the scheduled jog through practice yes it was mental its a big assignment check is what it is there were new things introduced we did some new things i took some situations that i wanted to work on that have occurred in the league that have been problems for people and we worked on those that gave us a head start on that kind of stuff we review that every saturday you look at it one of two ways you throw your hands up in the air and you get frustrated and you get nothing done or you do the best you can with the circumstances thats what we did today
3163339 he was the best available player at the time when the unfortunate injury to nehemiah warrick would not allow him to anytime soon be back with us
3163340 hes a veteran hes played special teams hes been a starter in the league we think that a guy of that nature can come in and make the adaptation that must move swiftly which we need as you know the numbers in camp are such that these guys have got to play they have to play right away

3163343 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3163344 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3163345 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3163346 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people

3163349 just to be clear the city does not license any propane facilities
3163350 we know propane facilities within 1 6 kilometres is the danger zone thats why people were asked to evacuate their houses within 1 6 kilometres i think its a reasonable thing to work from that kind of distancing

3163352 thats my house on the other side of that truck

3163360 overall we didnt play quality cricket to win the series we need to improve in all departments
3163361 i didnt expect the indian middle order to contribute so little earlier this year theyd been quite good in australia mendis did make a difference but with indias experience he shouldnt have been that big a factor
3163362 perhaps its time to look at youngsters for the middle order berths its a thought which definitely comes to mind after this defeat
3163363 the series drained us the good thing is that we had contributions from different players at different times
3163364 ich habe mit leuten geredet die kurz darauf gestorben sind weil sie andere retten wollten die sherpas sind noch einmal aufgestiegen und wurden von der lawine erfasst

3163374 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3163375 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3163376 at least one from each major family in the series
3163377 there are six long months of work in this research
3163378 some will be against this and some will be for it
3163379 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3163380 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3163381 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3163382 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3163383 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe
3163384 apple is clearly leveraging its technology portfolio from the iphone to improve the mac experience as well and we believe apple will continue to add multitouch gestures to its notebooks
3163385 were pleased that we achieved 43 million in segment profit during the first half of the year
3163386 weve been proactive in implementing a number of cost saving measures and made significant progress on the integration of our recent acquisitions all of which will benefit us on an ongoing basis given the significant decline in capital markets activity we are adjusting our annual guidance downward which is outlined later in the release

3163388 she said that some men find the sight of a bare breast quite offensive
3163389 some guests may be uncomfortable with a womans bare breast even when it is her right to feed her child
3163390 this was just an opportunity to suggest to ms tarbuck that she could cover up
3163391 this priest said insert comment here i cant believe he said that because it goes against church doctrine
3163392 we need the streets to be safer for cyclists the perceived lack of safety is absolutely an essential reason as to why people dont cycle as much as what they would like to do
3163393 having a 20mph speed restriction throughout the city as planned will help and junctions are very important
3163394 another thing is making life easy for cyclists in terms of getting from a to b we need more contra flow for cyclists in the citys streets like goat lane and pedestrian areas like london street to be opened up to cyclists out of hours
3163395 a lot of things we are talking about wouldnt cost too much and are not too difficult to do

3163417 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3163419 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3163420 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3163421 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3163422 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3163423 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3163424 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3163425 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3163426 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3163427 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life

3163432 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3163433 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3163434 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3163435 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3163436 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3163437 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3163438 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3163439 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3163440 mnd is so complicated that you need a range of skills to look for solutions we need teamwork and different scientific skills if we are going to solve this having all that under one roof will raise the profile of the disease and enable us to attract funding

3163470 the fire one computer firing system performed beautifully and was the biggest fire one system ever deployed during the competitions 25 year history and we were very very happy
3163471 in fact we used the latest ultra fire software released just the week prior to the show to fire from 172 modules with the greatest precision and we can confirm it works brilliantly
3163472 we had a very successful display and we had a great time working with the entire local la rhonde team who are a great bunch of guys and girls to work with
3163473 the ovation we received after the show and the positive feedback from the la ronde crew and many regular audience members was very satisfying and to win the silver medal is just a brilliant result

3163484 the inspector booked a case under the shops and commercial establishments act it should have been under the karnataka police act according to which the police have the discretion to fix closure timings people who are protesting the hotel deadline should read the rules
3163485 even in cities like mumbai and delhi owners have to take permission from the police to keep the premises open till 11 30 pm beyond this timing approval from the home secretary is necessary to keep it open till 1 am and above it is the chief minister s office which has to give the permission the law applies everywhere and bangalore is not an exception

3163550 one of the challenges is that these things are just flying all over the hemisphere
3163551 so to figure out the needs of these birds sorting out the why requires this huge geographic understanding of the populations and nobody really has that
3163552 documenting this is critical because you cant get groups to act unless you have good data to justify the action
3163553 but when youre dealing with birds that are moving so much it becomes very difficult
3163554 were in the process of building a north american wide monitoring program
3163555 but funding has been limited and you can imagine how difficult it is to track birds across the arctic
3163556 even if weve been successful with restoring wetlands what are they going to look like in 50 years with sea levels rising
3163557 some days i sit here and think with increasing human population sizes and no federal leadership and no curb on consumerism its hard to imagine how were going to do it
3163558 the americans we will smash them thats what we came here for
3163559 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3163560 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3163561 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3163562 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3163563 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3163564 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3163565 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3163566 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3163567 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3163568 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3163569 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3163570 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3163571 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3163572 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3163573 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3163574 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms and well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3163575 accordingly our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants we would like to enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as jpmorgan chase customers
3163576 any resolution would need to address the same concerns addressed in the settlements entered into next week
3163577 today were expanding our investigation into the auction rate securities scandal to insure investors across new york state and the nation get their money back
3163578 last week my office secured landmark agreements that will put 20 billion back in the pockets of investors we believe that when you protect the investor you also increase investor confidence which helps the entire market
3163579 last week me voice was a bag o s i had to have a word with meself i want this to be a success i want this to be great i thought im going to have to tone it down a bit
3163580 load of big fat lines load of cigarettes staying up late talking the same s you talked the night before and the night before that thats not good
3163581 prude how the sex obsessed culture hurts young women and america too
3163582 to be irish is to know that in the end the world will break your heart
3163583 city officials believe the property currently 90 percent asphalt could be better used than as a truck terminal and is looking to develop it as a light industrial use officials are in negotiations with yellow freight to purchase the property next to greenfield park
3163584 whats happening is that flooding events are all of a sudden not being labeled 50 year floods anymore
3163585 prior to that i hadnt heard anybody talking about it in the community
3163586 its more something you think that older people should take care of for us
3163587 a tasty foot long hero roll piled high with good meat and cheese at a very reasonable price be very hungry or save half for later my
3163588 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3163589 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3163590 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3163591 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3163592 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3163593 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3163594 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3163595 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3163596 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3163597 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3163598 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3163599 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3163600 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3163601 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3163602 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3163603 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3163604 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3163605 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3163606 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3163607 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3163608 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3163609 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3163610 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3163611 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3163612 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3163613 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3163614 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3163615 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far

3163631 we are helping acciona with tatanka whose name is inspired by the lakota indian tribal word for the buffalo that once roamed the midwest to charge into the american wind industry with a major project in the best wind farming area of the united states
3163632 the dakotas high wind energy potential and low population means that wind power will be available to transmit to the rest of the midwest
3163633 tatanka represents another major step toward accionas goal of reducing the worlds co2 emissions by 220 million tons in the next 23 years
3163634 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
3163635 we may never know how much money fred baron spent to cover up the story of john edwards affair but covering up is nothing new for the asbestos lawsuit king
3163636 baron routinely makes huge campaign contributions to groups with names like texas values and public justice to hide the truth from voters that the funding comes from the wealth he acquired as a personal injury trial lawyer
3163637 im always a proponent of giving team mvp awards to everyday players but its hard to argue about guthrie the guy is among the league leaders in quality starts and has been the only constant on the staff

3163641 with jssi we are consistently expanding our activities in raw materials supply
3163642 we manufacture ultra thin wafers from solar silicon and process them into solar cells and modules
3163643 in a few years solar power from your rooftop will be cheaper than power from an electrical outlet

3163647 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
3163648 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3163649 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3163650 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3163651 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3163652 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3163653 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3163654 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3163655 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3163656 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him

3163660 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations

3163665 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3163666 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3163667 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3163668 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation

3163671 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here

3163675 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3163676 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics

3163678 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
3163679 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly

3163718 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3163719 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable

3163741 the mbta will reserve comment on the substance of the presentation until staff has had a sufficient period of time to thoroughly review the information and meet with the students and their professor
3163742 this is not simply saying we did it arent we inventive its also providing a tool to help accomplish this our understanding is that these would likely be software tools that would make it easier to analyze the cards

3163746 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia
3163747 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
3163748 on request of the president of georgia the president of the republic of poland has provided the web site of the president of poland for dissemination of information
3163749 poti serves as a vital energy transit route to europe
3163750 over the past 48 hours russian forces have killed over 100 georgian civilians and soldiers after targeting residential complexes in georgia as well as airports bases and other vital infrastructure
3163751 however the spokesperson acknowledged that as yet georgia could not confirm that russia had been responsible as the causes were still
3163752 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3163753 misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
3163754 i had nothing to do with any money being paid and had no knowledge of any money being paid
3163755 this is something that was made up by that rag in the u k its just complete nonsense
3163756 we arent doing anything differently than any other year and we actually have less attrition this year than last year
3163757 we constantly talk to associates at simpson and we would have heard of something by now
3163758 ive heard the same simpson rumors but i havent seen anything definitive
3163759 so many practice groups right now are quiet and we dont have a bankruptcy upswing like we did with the last downturn
3163760 right now we just have to wait and see how this is going to pan out
3163761 i dont know how widespread it is but since the end of 2007 and the beginning of this year simpson began concentrating on these performance reviews
3163762 i do know its still happening across the board and theyre focusing more on the midlevels than otherwise would be the case because theyre the easiest to get rid of
3163763 theyll say i dont think you have a future here so maybe you should have a look around in the market
3163764 its very sneaky and sort of the opposite of what cadwalader did with its layoffs
3163765 im 100 percent certain that no one has been laid off in my office in the past five years and i would be shocked if layoffs were the case because i havent heard anything to that effect
3163766 but there are 600 lawyers in the new york office so who knows how these things get started
3163767 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3163768 russias actions have substantially damaged its reputation in the world
3163769 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3163770 theres really nothing that george w bush can or would or should do
3163771 this is no time for the united states to step up to the plate in any meaningful way unilaterally because what seems to be happening here once you sort through all the rhetoric is this is sort of the cold war coming back
3163772 based on preliminary information of what occurred its being investigated as a possible attack on a federal agent
3163773 we are talking about a violent person not someone you want playing with your kids
3163774 my mom normally rides in the front of the bus
3163775 the bone was broke so badly he said if it broke a little more she would have died instantly
3163776 im anxiously trying to find out about other people who im also worried about how are they where are they

3163778 shes a firecracker shell make it they told me she might not
3163779 what were asking the people to do is not to make their car window the store window for the thief please hide these items secure them somewhere else in your automobile
3163780 oh i know its a great release its a great release you be fearing walking the streets and stuff like that that
3163781 we were frightened we were frightened we have a lot of young kids and girls around here that we all look out for we were very concerned
3163782 i doubt that not up and down this area you dont have prostitution like that this is something he made a conscientious decision to do simple as that
3163783 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3163784 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3163785 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3163786 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3163787 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3163788 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3163789 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3163790 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3163791 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3163792 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3163793 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions

3163851 we also wanted to know about the history of the neandertals themselves
3163852 most argue there were a few thousand neandertals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
3163853 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neandertals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
3163854 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
3163855 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace

3163873 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3163874 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3163875 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3163876 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3163877 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3163878 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3163879 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3163880 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3163881 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3163882 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3163883 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3163884 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3163885 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3163886 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3163887 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3163888 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq

3163910 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3163911 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3163912 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3163913 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3163914 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members

3163922 we had budgeted 1 5 million and we spent 1 75 million thats a 500 000 fuel increase in one year its unheard of
3163923 some of the routes have been extended and some drivers are upset but we know our jobs are in jeopardy we have to find a way to cut our budget or our jobs are a thing of the past
3163924 we made the determination its in best interest of school district to discontinue that practice this morning we briefed all drivers the buses would be returning to local bus pounds
3163925 a lot of people need to bear with us we need to maximize the economy and increase ridership that means there is going to be some problems i e longer bus rides
3163926 things have been heating up weve killed a couple people and i wrote an episode this year actually i wrote a black and white 30s film noir piece its kind of casablanca meets dick tracy and mark schwahn really loved it i took all six years of the show and kind of incorporated different aspects of it then set it in the 30s

3163938 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3163939 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3163940 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

3163952 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3163953 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3163954 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3163955 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3163956 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3163957 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3163958 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3163959 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3163960 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3163961 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3163962 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3163963 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3163964 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3163965 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3163966 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3163967 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3163968 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3163969 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3163970 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3163971 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3163972 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3163973 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3163974 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3163975 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3163976 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3163977 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3163978 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3163979 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3163980 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3163981 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3163982 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3163983 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3163984 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3163985 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3163986 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3163987 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3163988 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3163989 geek told me that it would work with my with usb1
3163990 s a plus after i was told to factory setting and then restore it to folks at iriver wiping out all big fan which takes nice touch to upload again from the pc
3163991 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3163992 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3163993 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3163994 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3163995 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3163996 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3163997 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3163998 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3163999 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3164000 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3164001 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3164002 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3164003 definitely a peoples person our world will never be the same without him
3164004 born in cleveland ohio he now lives in clevelands ward 11
3164005 i am unwilling to conside to the other side what is moral or religious
3164006 were never going to be a healthy state if we dont address this issue
3164007 unfortunately its still a process in that i would hope it would be or what i think i initially anticipated
3164008 but im making strides in the right direction to be able to throw the ball around a little bit and do some of those things felt good i think every day its going to get better ill be able to do more and get back on the field soon
3164009 im a guy whether it was a negative situation or whatver it may have been put those things behind me move forward focus on the positives and what this team is about
3164010 i have to focus on what i have to do as far as getting healthy again and getting back on the football field thats first and foremost im not going to lose sleep or lose energy dwelling on something that i really didnt have any control over
3164011 obviously all flights are canceled until further notice i guess thats the update part on that
3164012 im just a journeyman according to some people why should i have any hard feelings im thankful to have this job i may pay tampa bay general manager bruce allen and jon for bringing me back out here
3164013 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3164014 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3164015 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned

3164019 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself

3164040 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3164041 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3164042 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3164043 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3164044 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3164045 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3164046 but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3164047 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3164048 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3164049 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3164050 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3164051 perhaps the most obvious political effect of controlled news is the advantage it gives powerful people in getting their issues on the political agenda and defining those issues in ways likely to influence their resolution
3164052 make men wise and by that very operation you make them free civil liberty follows as a consequence of this no usurped power can stand against the artillery of opinion
3164053 the man who does not do his own thinking is a slave and is a traitor to himself and his fellow men
3164054 freedom of expression is the well spring of our civilization the history of civilization is in considerable measure the displacement of error which once held sway as official truth by beliefs which in turn have yielded to other truths therefore the liberty of man to search for truth ought not to be fettered no matter what orthodoxies he may challenge
3164055 freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much that would be a mere shadow of freedom the test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order
3164056 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
3164057 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
3164058 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3164059 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3164060 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding

3164066 ignore the fact that this is a woody allen film it is nothing like his other neurotic works it is a great film that goes where you wont expect

3164074 o governo da r ssia deve respeitar a integridade territorial e a soberania da ge rgia o governo russo deve reverter a rota em que parece estar e deve aceitar este acordo de paz como primeiro passo para a resolu o do conflito

3164083 when he saw the police he turned the gun on himself and he is now deceased
3164084 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3164085 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3164086 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3164087 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3164088 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3164089 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3164090 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3164091 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3164092 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3164093 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

3164097 she said she was writing a book about holmes i laughed because i knew how hard it was to make the documentary
3164098 many years ago i made a film called johnny wadd and it turned into a series and john c holmes became a star
3164099 he became known as johnny wadd unfortunately for him i made a lot of films with him but people remember his johnny wadd films
3164100 there is so much ive forgotten im glad to be here tonight
3164101 but we were able with an unlimited number of pages to delve deeper
3164102 after doing some reading on this fabulous website i see my basic rudimentary first grade mistake i was looking to invest all of my nest and with a moderate 7 to 10 return could live nicely i guess thats the stock trader and futures trader in me coming out
3164103 in order to guarantee yourself a specified minimum future income regardless of market swings if your contract is annuitized election in grip ii is irrevocable and a fee of 45 of the income base will be charged on each contract anniversary or upon full withdrawal
3164104 the grip ii benefit does not provide a cash value guarantee nor is it a guarantee of any investment option grip ii can only be converted to a lifetime income stream upon annutization on any contract anniversary after your earliest election date
3164105 because we find no evidence for a major change in vegetation and or fire dynamics and because the megafauna had relatively low reproductive rates we favour the hypothesis that human hunting led to a rapid population collapse
3164106 in tasmania weve got as good evidence as anywhere that it was a very quick extinction
3164107 if humans had not arrived in australia the megafauna would still be here now thats what i believe
3164108 i think in tasmania the whole show could have been over within a thousand years or so
3164109 the broader picture is the megafauna survived all of those environmental fluctuations in tact but its the arrival of people that is the key factor
3164110 the results show that megafauna persisted in tasmania until at least 41 000 years ago which is similar to or slightly later than the time of extinction on the australian mainland
3164111 importantly that time postdates the establishment of a land bridge across the bass straight and is statistically concordant with the minimum age for the earliest evidence of humans in tasmania
3164112 the evidence that humans cause the extinction of giant ice age mammals in australia by over hunting them is now much stronger
3164113 the big picture that is now much clearer is that when people arrive other animals disappear
3164114 this is a sad and it seems almost inevitable feature of our species impact on nature
3164115 supporters of the rival theory that climate change killed off the megafauna have run out of places to hide
3164116 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3164117 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3164118 at least one from each major family in the series
3164119 there are six long months of work in this research
3164120 some will be against this and some will be for it
3164121 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3164122 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3164123 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3164124 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3164125 it is rare for an opera to include a string quartet and choir one of our goals for the performance is to redefine what opera is

3164129 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3164130 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3164131 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3164132 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3164133 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3164134 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3164135 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3164136 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3164137 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3164138 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3164139 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3164140 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3164141 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3164142 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3164143 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3164144 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3164145 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3164146 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3164147 explain to me how you can live with your conscience and sleep at night
3164148 why emulate the failures of american education as opposed to the successes of european education
3164149 they could be if canadian policy makers like you did their jobs correctly
3164150 because we find no evidence for a major change in vegetation and or fire dynamics and because the megafauna had relatively low reproductive rates we favour the hypothesis that human hunting led to a rapid population collapse
3164151 in tasmania weve got as good evidence as anywhere that it was a very quick extinction
3164152 if humans had not arrived in australia the megafauna would still be here now thats what i believe

3164199 sprecher des au enministeriums und der cia lehnten es ab zu best tigen dass mr woodruff f r den geheimdienst arbeitete aber hochrangige funktion re der administration sagten dass er dies tat und f gten hinzu dass die cia stand dem ehemaligen pr sidenten georgiens so nahe

3164206 our relationship with each other is the criterion the world uses to judge whether our message is truthful christian community is the final apologetic

3164208 all wars are civil wars because all men are brothers each one owes infinitely more to the human race than the particular country in which he was born
3164209 the paradox of hospitality is that it wants to create emptiness not a fearful emptiness but a friendly emptiness where strangers can enter and discover themselves as free free to sing their own songs speak their own languanges dance their own dances free also to leave and follow their own vocations

3164808 heres how it works after slogging through olympic broadcasts of yore we drew up a list of 33 syrupy words that nbc has chronically overused adversity battled cancer challenges courage cry death dedication determination dream emotion glory golden hardship heart hero inspiration inspire journey magic memory miracle mom mother olympic sized overcome passion proud sacrifice spirit tears tragedy triumph while these 33 words are by no means an unabridged collection of schmaltzy nouns adjectives and verbs theyre a good sampling of nbcs bathos think of them as the dow jones of sap

3164813 la cuesti n del idh es vital para las regiones ya que este impuesto compromete el financiamiento de las regiones y as es la autonom a misma la que est en juego
3164814 el enfrentamiento se centrar en el idh puesto que sin recursos la autonom a no servir de gran cosa
3164815 est claro que los extremos se han fortalecido hoy estamos igual que antes del referendo s lo que m s polarizados y con diferencias m s profundas
3164816 se habla de di logo pero eso est visto que ha fracasado
3164817 m s divisi n m s enfrentamiento claramente hay un mandato de negociaci n para ambas partes porque claramente ninguna tiene apoyo en el pa s

3164834 i started using music when i realised that it was a good way to send a message and bring people together
3164835 even when you play a loud radio people are drawn to it even when it plays sounds that are not about dirty water they just want to listen to the sounds i realised that music had this power so for this reason we thought it would be good to mix it with what we wanted to achieve
3164836 it shows that even if you live in poor places such as niassa you can have an influence on the world lets not talk about the money lets do things that can change the world dont think about awards think about quality of life
3164837 mikes great attitude has been prevalent throughout this whole process mikes fight is not an easy one to take on but because he believes in himself so does everyone around him
3164838 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century he said in his strongest condemnation yet of the fighting
3164839 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said
3164840 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardise russias relations with the united states and europe mr bush warned
3164841 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government he said
3164842 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush
3164843 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and would be
3164844 there has been a significant change in the market as the world is revaluing assets based upon the perceived health of their own economies as it relates to the suddenly stronger us economy said phil flynn at alaron trading
3164845 the market turned a blind eye to problems with the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline and the escalating conflict between russia and georgia said sucden analyst nimit khamar
3164846 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3164847 para estos chiles el mayor peligro se produce antes de la dispersi n de las semillas cuando un n mero importante puede destruirse por este hongo
3164848 tanto el hongo como el p jaro se alimentan de semillas pero el hongo nunca contribuye a su dispersi n s lo las mata
3164849 la capsaicina no frena la diseminaci n de las semillas porque los p jaros no sienten el dolor producido por el picante y por lo tanto contin an comiendo pimientos pero el hongo es bastante sensible a esta sustancia
3164850 la capsaicina protege a los chiles y sus semillas de un pat geno f ngico que reduce gravemente la viabilidad de las semillas estos resultados ofrecen un gran respaldo para el papel de los microbios en la conformaci n de la qu mica de la fruta en las especies silvestres
3164851 antes de que hubiera sistema de refrigeraci n comer chile fue probablemente una respuesta adaptativa sobre todo en los tr picos

3164854 of all the duties and responsibilities entrusted to me as governor none is greater than my obligation to protect the health and well being of the people of kansas
3164855 we know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change as an agricultural state kansas is particularly vulnerable
3164856 i am not the one who hands out the permits
3164857 we are not going to eliminate coal a native source that we have as one of the sources that will power our country
3164858 we are not going to abandon coal from the portfolio
3164859 we have the giraffes we have the gorillas orangutans we have zebra lions tigers

3164861 weve also extended our butterfly exhibit blooming butterflies through september 7th so guests can enjoy that as well at night time people can come in and drive by and see the conservatory dome which is on the historic landmark registry and see it all lit up in its glory
3164862 hee haw and rfd tv is a match made in heaven
3164863 even though the jury acquitted me of these charges in less than three hours my political opponents and some of the news media would likely spend the next several months vilifying me further
3164864 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make
3164865 he atwater had been seen with that weapon prior to this crime
3164866 in mexico investigators have provided some tremendous leads to weapons trafficking organizations
3164867 tracing where these weapons are from is critical in the early stages
3164868 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3164869 mystified about the failure of the national media to pursue the story as it has allegations of other candidates affairs
3164870 well my gut tells me that had senator edwards dropped out of the race or had this become public prior to iowa that we would have done better in iowa the exit polling tells something different
3164871 we would have won iowa and the nomination if it hadnt been for edwards and the media
3164872 i would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for those meddling kids
3164873 in effect he was acting as obamas running mate and obama benefited enormously from having edwards do some dirty work against hillary
3164874 there can be little doubt that today the strongest best qualified candidate hillary clinton would be the democratic nominee
3164875 edwards gave his endorsement to obama but not his delegates lets go get em the delegates i mean
3164876 cough up the delegates or we will reveal that the kid is really his
3164877 i do hope that is true realclear politics has it that obama got edwards 21 delegates if not for that and halving all those votes clinton would be ahead in the pledged delegate count and didnt they tell the superdelegates to vote for the one who had the most pledged delegates that would be clinton and of course she won in the popular vote im with you lets go get em there votes rightfully belong to clinton
3164878 senator clinton would of been the democratic nominee if john cant keep it in his pants edwards wasnt around it was a set up point blank no one senator edwards included would believe that he would ever get the nomination so what was the point probably to do the attacking when it came to senator clinton and do what senator obama could not do
3164879 clinton would have won if edwards had dropped out early
3164880 why the media sat on this iowa caucus time it was abc anyone but clinton so he was protected iowa might have gone differently otherwise
3164881 there has been no secret about his infidelities only a refusal by power brokers in the party in the press to use it to edwards detriment at least not publically this stands in stark contrast to the way in which every utterance or appearance by hillary was cast as reprehensible even when the alleged behavior was simply invented at the same time the flip side of male privilege the right to exploit harass intimidate and threaten women as they please was on display day after day
3164882 edwards served a purpose during the primary he took white votes away from hillary which helped obama
3164883 saakashvilis fate is in the hands of his own people
3164884 when leaders become obstacles to a peoples way out of a situation in those situations some leaders make the brave decision in regards to their political future
3164885 a person who gives the order to commit war crimes as a result of which thousands of russian citizens including peacekeepers lost their lives cannot be considered as a partner by russia
3164886 many nato countries are wincing from the bloodbath georgia has created
3164887 the scale of the cynicism is amazing the ability to call black white and white black the ability to so smoothly present the aggressor as the victim of aggression and lay responsibility for the consequences on the victims
3164888 the cold war mentality has firmly taken hold in the heads of some american diplomats
3164889 somoza is a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch and we will help him and we will defend him
3164890 of course saddam hussein had to be hung for destroying some shia villages and the current georgian rulers who wiped ten ossetian villages off the face of the earth in an hour of course they have to be protected
3164891 it isnt possible to set up an anti russian european coalition and here we are close to putins position
3164892 moscow needs understand that the peacekeeping task currently entrusted solely to its military needs be discussed with the international community
3164893 we as a nation have got to ask ourselves what the hell is going on
3164894 oh noes the government is adding rainbow essence to our drinking water
3164895 we played the pc version of the game for this review
3164896 what part of this line in the review doesnt make sense
3164897 we played the pc version of the game for this review
3164898 yeah but keeping in mind you have a biased reviewer reviewing a wiiware game
3164899 this is a great game if you like the show
3164900 i cant see how they could continue for more than a year and a half or two years
3164901 as soon as there are sale talks customers would start to abandon chrysler in droves
3164902 hey some random asu jock come fuck the shit out of me in a meaningless drunken stuper
3164903 our thinking is that life without possibility of parole rashad raleigh off our streets for sure for the rest of his life is a very good deal and we feel it very much serves the public interest
3164904 what is the secretary of veterans affairs thinking on may 5 the department led by james b peake issued a directive that bans nonpartisan voter registration drives at federally financed nursing homes rehabilitation centers and shelters for homeless veterans as a result too many of our most patriotic american citizens our injured and ill military veterans may not be able to vote this november
3164905 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3164906 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3164907 this is a planning took where all things are going
3164908 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3164909 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3164910 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3164911 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3164912 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3164913 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3164914 are you sure my buddy waldos gonna be over you remember him my friend from the metro
3164915 so does that change your mind the pot just got sweeter eh
3164916 i think she likes you she was friendly on the phone but not too friendly
3164917 they must be saying we cant keep our sites up but we dont think russian hackers can take down blogspot given googles much better infrastructure and ability to defend it
3164918 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyberlocked
3164919 we know a land locked country has no access to the sea
3164920 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyberlocked
3164921 we know a land locked country has no access to the sea countries like ge georgia might rely too heavily on one or a handful of connections potentially through hostile countries eg ru russia for their physical connectivity as a result an adversary can control their network access to the outside world
3164922 version 8 0 is the largest and most feature filled launch that weve ever come out with
3164923 with searchfit merchants dont have to pay extensive amounts of money to have complex custom built solutions they can have high tech online stores with hosted solution cost
3164924 we were always putting emphasis on seo and marketing aspects when implementing new features to our shopping cart software the new version of searchfit hardly finds little competition among hosted shopping cart solutions our clients websites are not limited by a drag and drop solution but are rather fully customizable to match their needs with search engine traffic direct feeds to google base and many other marketing tools our clients can run successful online ventures even without extensive knowledge of online marketing
3164925 the research proves for the first time that if you eliminate the garbage the cells will keep functioning well and are pretty much the same as they were when they were young
3164926 perhaps the most contentious issue has been mr morales s land reform project in santa cruz the economically vibrant eastern department rich landowning families in the area have clashed with government officials seeking to distribute their landholdings to aymara and quechua indian migrants
3164927 late last month audiencia nacional the national court of spain the highest spanish judicial council issued arrest warrants against the six binyamin ben eliezer doron almog moshe yaalon dan halutz giora eiland and mike herzog accepting a petition from the palestinian center for human rights that suggested they were guilty of war crimes in the gaza strip during the summer of 2002
3164928 long term situation and he is not expected back any time soon
3164929 a safety and health program and work site inspections are conducted
3164930 unsafe conditions are eliminated and employees are trained in safety health and hazards that are applicable to their work environment
3164931 we have no idea what were pitching so be prepared for anything that vaguely relates to media
3164932 what does this add say the movie is really about
3164933 ya dije que es casi imposible que se juegue como se jug el primer tiempo frente a estudiantes ya que si jugamos as ser amos campeones mundiales
3164934 the relationship with the staff is something that ill miss you have to genuinely like each other
3164935 for all of his unpopularity with bloggers the traditional media progressives and politicians garry south was likely the most experienced and competent campaign manager available
3164936 anyone who thinks newsom will run for governor as a san francisco progressive hasnt been paying attention to the mayors history and career he ran for mayor the first time as a pro business moderate and thats how hell run for governor
3164937 may have gotten a little bit ahead of himself with gay marriage but the country as a whole will catch up
3164938 not afraid of change that can only bode well for someone who has a good future in politics
3164939 a very attractive very intelligent new political figure on the california scene and one who has shown gutsy moves in areas like tackling the homeless problem and improving the citys business environment
3164940 the danger he faces is believing that san francisco politics is just a smaller version of california statewide politics
3164941 an unfortunate and somewhat self indulgent move that had some effect on the presidential campaign
3164942 i cant say that john kerry would have won without the issue
3164943 but it was certainly not helpful to have our democratic ticket having to campaign in states like ohio which had a gay marriage thing on the ballot
3164944 no matter whether you support or oppose the beijing government we see the olympics as an achievement for all the chinese people everywhere
3164945 its for what hosting the olympics means to the history of the chinese people
3164946 all those years of chinas humiliation carried over to america where chinese kids grew up being taunted and bullied on the playground now when we see the home country shown in a positive light we hope americans will understand better where chinese americans come from
3164947 it was on the western horizon at the same time as the moonrise on the 16th or 17th of july
3164948 the stars surrounding it are in sagittarius the bright one to the right is nunki for the moon and jupiter to have been on those relatives positions it would have to have been on july 18th looking east about 30 minutes after sunset
3164949 turns out the kindle is becoming the ipod of the book world
3164950 the blackberry bold is a breakthrough smart phone for both professional and personal use
3164951 the blackberry bold smart phone delivers an amazing combination of functionality performance usability and design making it an ideal choice for business professionals and power users
3164952 the blackberry bold smart phone perfectly combines state of the art communications and multimedia functionality attractive design high speed internet access and an intuitive user experience making it the perfect smart phone solution
3164953 rim is no longer a mobile office and e mail player it has evolved into a deeply embedded enterprise vendor and we continue to push this as the key differentiator
3164954 so while apple nokia motorola and now htc corp continue to compete on enterprise hardware designs they cannot stack up to rim in terms of the enterprise ecosystems rim has in place
3164955 this remains a crucial difference that will make competition here almost meaningless
3164956 the battle for higher end consumers has escalated significantly the next iphone will boast 3g and may get out the door before the bold but it will be quite interesting to see how the bold does as a prosumer device
3164957 our view remains that rim and apple are market complementary and that each will continue to find its own set of users
3164958 we will be one of the only vendors to provide wired and wireless solutions that integrated end to end to our customers so that is key part
3164959 with this acquisition we have extended our capabilities in the wlan wireless lan space to include 802 11n and that will be a big part of that portfolio it also helps us augments the solutions that we are already providing in the market today
3164960 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt
3164961 the thing weve all been looking for is what can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video
3164962 the fccs tests of prototype white space devices at fedex field prior to saturdays game conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
3164963 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3164964 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions
3164965 these tests reveal fundamental deficiencies of sensing devices issues that cannot be pushed off with a promise to resolve these problems at some later time during certification testing
3164966 just as the bench testing has shown time and time again the science behind spectrum sensing is sound the current field tests including saturdays test at fedex field have done nothing to contradict the previous results
3164967 the fcc has the information it needs to move forward with their final report and the development of rules of the road for white space technologies
3164968 in particular stand alone use of a geolocation database with a look up function would offer complete protection to digital tv and wireless microphone signals at major venues
3164969 importantly under our approach no wsd white spaces device would transmit even if it failed to detect any signals at all without first receiving affirmative permission from a geolocation database look up
3164970 with or without spectrum sensing its abundantly clear that unlicensed devices can coexist successfully with licensed services with no reasonable fear of harmful interference

3164995 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3164996 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3164997 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3164998 the overarching goal of the spatial history project is to create dynamic interactive tools that can be used across the spectrum represented by these research projects from economic and technological changes to social and political changes and changes in science and the environment and bring them all together to enable the creation of new knowledge and understanding of historical change in space and time and the possibilities for our present and future that may be found in the past

3165226 it isnt a crime to cheat on ones cancer stricken wife but certainly it is ethically dubious to direct campaign contributions to a slush fund of sorts for ones mistress which is exactly what edwards did using his political action committee to pay the woman in question 100 000 in a four month span to create four web videos of him ironically one including a public speech where he discussed morality the payment was well in excess of market rates especially given the recipients lack of relevant experience such an unsavory arrangement should certainly disqualify a politician from running as vice president or serving as attorney general or accepting a supreme court nomination

3165233 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principles of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading

3165240 the economy continues to worsen and we must make the painful choice to reduce expenses further
3165241 we may limit the number of voluntary applications we accept given business needs or to ensure that no one area of the operation is unfairly impacted
3165242 we will evaluate the number of employees leaving under the voluntary program how work will be streamlined reallocated and consolidated and what additional expense reductions may still be necessary then we will determine if additional staff reductions must be made through an involuntary severance program

3165258 like all great satire the book is cerebral irreverent and hilarious while also edifying
3165259 this book is hilarious lanham didnt skimp on his research the book provides a telling overview of the religious rights leadership the beliefs they espouse and just how incredibly absurd and hypocritical they are
3165260 a funny book with some funny cartoons on everyone from rick warren as the evangelical jimmy buffett to a guide for christian haircuts that is hilarious i was chuckling until i saw that i am the postscript
3165261 every good little liberal will have this book on order as a stocking stuffer come jesus birthday
3165262 a handbook for coping with bible thumpers when considering the power and influence evangelical christians wield in this country you have to laugh to keep from crying robert lanham understands this well and offers much needed totally biased comic relief
3165263 not only is this an important book its a funny book
3165264 author robert lanham is an observer but with his latest the sinners guide to the evangelical right lanhams keen eye has hit perhaps his most entertaining target
3165265 it s hard to remember a more pointed and scathing attack lanham launches a focused sustained barrage on the pat robertsons and james dobsons of the world he s done his homework
3165266 an utterly biased humorous one stop guide to the major evangelical players
3165267 check out robert lanhams author of the fabled hipster handbook and former bible belt resident sinners guide to the evangelical right its funny because its true
3165268 like the daily show or the colbert report its humor reveals the basic truth
3165269 the book does for religion what jon stewart does for politics
3165270 informative laugh out loud funny and horrifying at times check out this snide leftie geared guide to the major evangelical players
3165271 this book should lay at the lifeless feet of your corpse as a silent yet powerful and all encompassing explanation as to why you took your own life

3165276 i threw myself too hard on my two and a half
3165277 it was a whirl of emotions for us im glad we got the nerves out got the few mistakes out of the way and now we go out and get ready for finals
3165278 when it comes to three up three count this is a totally different ball game
3165279 i believe the girls will do a better job at finals
3165280 we have more experience at the three up three count
3165281 they his team get a 70 percent because he dropped from the bars
3165282 we expected to win a medal on that event the disappointment was hes mistake
3165283 but we are a young team i think we can do it better next time
3165284 the discussions so far have centred around what boral intend to do with the site and the wood agreement with forests nsw we want it to stay connected with the site
3165285 the timber from walcha should be attached to that site if boral are not interested in recommencing at the site we want to put the proposition of a lease or a sale
3165286 thus far the newcastle tamworth service has been moderately successful
3165287 we accept that any new service takes time to establish however our board has been disappointed with the uptake after six months of operation
3165288 our board has given us a last attempt to preserve the service we are at a use it or lose it ultimatum
3165289 the feedback we received indicated customers wanted earlier nighttime departures back to newcastle from tamworth because on the old schedule it wasnt departing until 8pm
3165290 people also said they wanted to travel on monday so we are hopeful the new schedule will increase the support we are receiving from both tamworth and newcastle residents
3165291 if it doesnt we will regrettably be forced to cancel the service
3165292 it has been my understanding that it was the scheduling of the flights that was the problem for local residents
3165293 the service was not as conducive to other connecting flights as it could have been
3165294 as well i have been told the remoteness of the newcastle airport at williamtown from the city centre made it sometimes easier for patrons to drive to newcastle and have a vehicle at their disposal instead
3165295 hopefully they aeropelican have taken on board customer feedback and adjusted the schedule to the needs of tamworth residents
3165296 that was definitely something beneficial and it would be a shame to lose the service due to the programming of the flights
3165297 if we see a gradual increase in the next few weeks then it would be reasonable to expect it would continue to increase
3165298 however if it doesnt then its unlikely it will get better the month after that or the month after that
3165299 there does come a time when we have to bite the bullet and say this isnt working and we dont want to do that but thats the reality
3165300 my visit was about a listening exercise it had nothing to do with politics
3165301 it is unfortunate that it was made an issue ill still be going and i will go to the education department and see if they can organise this another way
3165302 my view was to listen to the teachers concerns ive gone out here in good faith this was an information gathering visit
3165303 they the changes are an issue in my electorate and in the western suburbs
3165304 people are wanting to get out because they see the dismantling of the system going on
3165305 it would be unprecedented for the minister to approve a visit to a school by a campaigning politician to lobby teachers during an industrial dispute
3165306 the vast majority of schools in barwon have priority transfer status
3165307 this clearly shows how the government and senior bureaucrats are afraid to debate publicly or with teachers the merits of their proposed changes to school staffing
3165308 when authoritative persons such as mr humphries who personally understands and knows how the changes will adversely affect the attraction and retention of teachers to schools in the barwon electorate are gagged by a government that does not understand rural and isolated communities the electorate will realise how desperate and lacking in relevant ideas this government is
3165309 i wouldnt have thought a 30 a week increase in the single pension would affect inflation
3165310 i cant afford to do the repairs and physically my body cant cope
3165311 i have sold antique furniture and other bits and pieces over the past few months to try and keep ahead of the bills
3165312 last month i bought groceries the same ones i buy every week and when i compared the docket to the one from this time last year it was 27 more
3165313 i had no money left from my single pension to buy wood to keep warm and was forced to layer up clothing upon clothing to keep warm for the week
3165314 whats worse is i know im not the only one
3165315 pensioners i know are house bound because they cant afford to go out and do things
3165316 many feel they cant talk about their problems we grew up in an era where if you had a problem you left it at home and went out into the world with a smile on your face
3165317 my pride is all i have left thats why i want to remain anonymous
3165318 two people i know who had been friends got married just so they could get a double pension and sell one of their houses
3165319 they live separate lives but have the financial security to actually live the truth is if they hadnt done that they both would have gone under
3165320 if the single pension was two thirds of what the double pension is life would be much easier for a lot of us

3165330 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3165331 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3165332 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3165333 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question
3165334 yes lets see a side by side comparison asap im a life long journalist and everything i write is 100 percent from my brain or attributed this piece i wrote while doing 200 or so interview s for the techcrunch50 event
3165335 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3165336 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
3165337 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable
3165338 but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
3165339 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach
3165340 moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals

3165349 what i want to know is can you watch something that can change you
3165350 for the last three years i vowed to get to the center of what i know im a part of which is one of the greatest bands in the world today
3165351 my intent was to make you sick to your stomach
3165352 it was said to me very early in my career that rock n roll is 23 hours of hell and one hour of god
3165353 thats what i want you to hear because thats what hes going through
3165354 the band is 10 years old and i felt that we needed to talk for real
3165355 were going into our places of choice individually and youre being invited all the way in hopefully youll be able to stomach what is real
3165356 im not worried about going anywhere because were only getting better
3165357 we constantly remind all of you that we dont push the envelope because we are the envelope
3165358 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
3165359 this is to advise all political entities in the investigation area that tennessee political life scientist robert h goddard has designed this unit to probe for all possibilities of intelligent political life in this office
3165360 its 5 month mission is to explore the unsupervised use of grant funds to seek out undocumented use of mayors hospitality funds and to boldly go where receipt less county p card charges expense reimbursements and travel expenses have gone before and then decide if they constitute clear evidence of lack of political intelligence
3165361 not meant to convey any conclusion as to whether or not laws have been violated violated vio um er those are matters to be determined by legal precedent and there hasnt been one of those around here in years
3165362 to be involved in the entire probe for the possibility of developing a two hour documentary titled the k n o x files i want to deceive
3165363 been conferring for the past several weeks regarding the ongoing controversy in knox county related to whether the mayors office has shown any signs of intelligent political life lately in light of this we have agreed that this office is best suited to probe and if appropriate document the signs of political life or lack thereof
3165364 doesnt want to bite the hand that feeds it and therefore you are too close to the matter to objectively decide if the mayors office has shown signs of intelligent political life and so you have removed yourself from the probe area to avoid any possibility of giving the probe conflicting data
3165365 well undertake any and all political iq tests presented to us
3165366 we didnt just tumble off the turnip turnover truck topple off the apple truck turnov whatever were not political babes in the wolves clothing we know which way the wind is blowing because we can smell the barbarians at the gate well take the tests and pass with lying col flying flying colors

3165385 i like to try new things theres just something about the feeling of ice on my nipples that turns me on its so cold and im so hot it gives me goosebumps and its just this super intense sensation that makes me wanna reach down and touch myself
3165386 yes i do and yes it does i like to do it when im masturbating cause sometimes my clit will get sensitive from rubbing it too much but i wont want to stop cumming so ill take a breather and put some ice on my button to cool it down and numb it a little when the ice melts i rub the cold water all over my spread pussy so it mixes with my juices and drips down my slit and into my ass crack it gives me shivers just thinking about it
3165387 first a guy has to lick my pussy lightly and stick his finger in a little bit building me up until im super horny and begging for more then when my pussy is tender and sticky even the lightest blow on my cunny will make me quiver and squirt

3165390 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3165391 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3165392 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3165393 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3165394 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3165395 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3165396 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3165421 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3165422 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3165423 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3165424 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3165430 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3165431 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3165432 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3165433 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3165434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3165435 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3165436 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3165437 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3165438 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3165439 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3165440 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3165441 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3165442 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3165443 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3165444 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3165445 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3165446 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3165447 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3165448 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3165449 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3165450 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3165451 oh just because you hate the titanic underwater doesnt mean that you should hate the movie
3165452 god cannot give human beings the free will to act and yet control their actions
3165453 in a sense god does allow his gift for choice to trump his gift for good
3165454 many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles
3165455 in order that peters shadow might fall on some of them as they came by
3165456 immediately his feet and ankles were made strong jumping up he stood and began to walk
3165457 she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up
3165458 unclean spirits crying with loud shrieks came out of many who were possessed and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured
3165459 god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them
3165460 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year
3165461 there is no other instance where new vaccines must be made every year the approval of flu vaccines is a part of fdas mission to promote the health of americans throughout the year
3165462 currently only 40 percent of health care workers in the united states are vaccinated against influenza
3165463 increasing the number of vaccinated health care personnel can be a strong front in the annual battle against the flu
3165464 health care workers can set an example for the patients they serve as well as decrease the likelihood of contracting and transmitting the virus

3165471 if theres a chance to win everybody wants to win on that field
3165472 thats what we work for thats what we work for out at practice we dont work just to kind of go through the motions i want to practice winning for me as a head coach its not like im gritting my teeth and punching guys and grabbing guys and shaking guys or anything like that its just that i like to win and i think every coach does so every coach is out there to win regardless of who he has on the field
3165473 i wanted to run a screen down there we picked one out and i was kind of excited about it
3165474 i just felt it was a very good play and it was executed well they all have to be executed it would have been a very crummy play had we not executed well
3165475 when we look at the video and youre executing everybodys executing the plays have a real good chance of being successful its when youre not executing that disaster happens for the most part we are executing what were setting out to do
3165476 if you just stay on one side with taylor you have a plan
3165477 you get your back going that way all day to help chip block you help the tackle out that has to block him all day you slide the line that way you can make plans
3165478 there were a couple of plays during the week that i said when i get here im calling this play and its going to be successful when i call it and it sort of happened it did it happened
3165479 and it wasnt anything that we were looking at on video and identified a weakness in buffalos defense it was just that if we execute this play then this could be a big play for us a couple of those happened
3165480 did get accomplished what we wanted to as far as seeing the players in the first two games
3165481 we executed our game plan i didnt come up with new plays because i wanted to be competitive to win i just used the sheet that we went into the game with we did get to call and see a lot of the things that we wanted to find out
3165482 the thing that i really was impressed with jason last night was that he had two pocket scrambles he was in the pocket scrambled in the pocket and bought time then drilled the ball very accurately those are things im looking for weve been drilling those things he made a couple of plays that were big league plays that way
3165483 there was a guy open in front he should have hit or turn that down all together and go elsewhere we were all disappointed in that it really created an opportunity for them to get back in the game and that put our defense in our real bind we have to improve

3165489 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3165490 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3165491 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3165492 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3165493 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3165494 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3165502 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3165503 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3165504 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3165505 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3165506 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3165507 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3165508 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3165509 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3165510 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3165511 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3165512 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3165513 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3165514 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3165515 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3165516 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3165517 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3165518 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3165519 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3165520 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3165521 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3165522 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3165523 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3165524 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3165525 fizemos uma reuni o com a ag ncia nacional de vigil ncia sanit ria anvisa que fez essa recomenda o eles tamb m est o elaborando um protocolo mais completo
3165526 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3165527 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3165528 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3165529 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3165532 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3165533 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3165553 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3165554 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3165555 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3165556 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3165562 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3165563 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3165564 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

3165613 scanty rain in the onion producing areas of nasik in maharashtra and gujarat delayed sowing of the kharif crop

3165616 the ncdex has launched the coriander futures contract which will cater to the requirements of value chain participants but the exchanges must ensure correct polling in the spot market which necessary for the success of the futures contract in that commodity if proper polling is done the contract can get more liquidity from hedgers and other stakeholders that in turn will make the contract successful

3165709 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3165710 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3165711 everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3165712 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions

3165776 more concerned with threats from regional enemies like iran than a us invasion
3165777 the report stated that according to habbush saddam had ended his nuclear program in 1991 the same year he destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile iraq had no intention habbush said of restarting either program

3165781 i think to come from a goal behind against a team like dundee united and score three goals theyve tested us late on in the game thomas cerny certainly made a couple of good saves but i think overall i think we thoroughly deserved it
3165782 i said before we will play in the right manner and i think we showed that tonight
3165783 i think the two young boys in the middle of the park were sensational james mcarthur and james mccarthy and the most important thing for me is that were a team were a unit
3165784 if you get that in a football team then youve always got a chance
3165785 were not going to get carried away its the opening game and i think were top of the league just like last season i joke at that but youve got to enjoy these times
3165786 the players worked really really hard there are tired players in there and rightly so but to beat dundee united in the manner we did is fantastic for me and this club
3165787 i didnt see it i think the players are talking about it but to be honest with you i think mark mclaughlin won the header and i thought that was the goal
3165788 i think there may be a touch off james mcarthur so i hear ill look at that tonight but you take these wee breaks when you get them

3165826 urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3165827 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3165828 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3165829 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3165830 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3165831 we signed a plan saying that the status quo ante is to be restored
3165832 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3165833 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3165834 the only thing worse for you than you is me
3165835 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life

3165841 i guess we are who we are for alot of reasons and maybe well never know most of them
3165842 why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out
3165843 yes the past can hurt but you can either run from it or learn from it
3165844 how do you expect to move on with your life if your still trying to hang on to your past
3165845 dont ask me what i think of you i might not give the answer that you want me to
3165846 nobody wants him he just stars at the world planning his vengenace that he will soon unfold
3165847 send me dead flowers to my wedding and i wont forget to put roses on your grave
3165848 your dangerous cause your honest your dangerous cause you dont know what you want

3165855 i thought youd mite have some advice on how to be insenstive
3165856 and we listen to the songs that say wot we feel

3165858 i always like to know everything about my new friend and nothing about my old one

3165860 its a story about a king whos lost his kingdom and all the albums artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas theres this slightly anti authoritarian viewpoint thats crept into some of the lyrics and its some of the payoff between being surrounded by governments on one side but also were human beings with emotions and were all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up with every day hence the album title

3165863 theyre too awful come get me p l e a s e
3165864 darling daughter you must tell me what has you so upset tell mother the 4 letter words

3165868 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings and in cars its impossible to count them now theres hardly a single building left undamaged
3165869 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3165870 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
3165871 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
3165872 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
3165873 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3165874 gives a good snapshot of russias position vis a vis natural resources in the region
3165875 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field
3165876 a new model of cooperation in the energy sector that would allow foreign partners to share in the economic benefits of the project share the management and take on a share of the industrial commercial and financial risks
3165877 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
3165878 much of the city tskhinvali was reportedly in flames friday the regional parliament building had burned down the university was on fire and the towns main hospital had been rendered inoperative by the bombardment
3165879 russian soldiers captured group of american mercenaries on territory of south ossetia group was captured near of zare village
3165880 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
3165881 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3165882 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
3165883 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished
3165884 to our mind the efforts undertaken by this defendant to avoid conclusive identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value
3165885 any identification we make must be checked double checked supported and verified by every means possible those efforts remain ongoing at this hour
3165886 what it means is that were asking anybody who knew him or was associated with him between 1985 and 1988 to come forward

3165901 i think the moral of the story is to not take things so literally the bible has been changed by human hands and many books of the bible have never been seen you can not take it as absolute word no matter what any other man has stood on a pulpit and told you how to believe god will naturally instill his word within you if that is his will you are born with him you should never depend on another human to let you know what is right and wrong it is in you thats all dont read to deep into the subject it is only a song

3165953 college often teaches you to write long discursive papers on extremely complicated things dont do that here in the real world people want solutions and they want them expressed simply

3165955 theres nothing wrong with telling students to rewrite a paper for a better grade if they think they can do better
3165956 in a way students talking to each other during a final exam is not a bad thing when you ask employers what they look for in an employee they always say they want someone who can work efficiently as part of a team

3165960 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3165961 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3165962 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3165963 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3165964 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3165965 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing

3165969 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3165970 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3165971 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3165972 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3165973 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3165974 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3165975 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3165976 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3165977 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3165978 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day

3165981 los intereses econ micos de las empresas en desmedro del pueblo juje o
3165982 la primera consulta que le realizamos fue cu l era la pol tica prevista por el gobierno en relaci n a la miner a a lo que nos respondi el ministro de gobierno que por no ser su rea de competencia estaba imposibilitado de contestar y que transmitir a nuestras demandas al gobernador
3165983 el tema est instalado en la opini n p blica desde hace mucho tiempo de manera que consider bamos que ten a la obligaci n de estar informado los ciudadanos juje os realizamos una marcha en busca de respuestas y no para informar a los funcionarios que se supone conocen lo que ocurre en la provincia
3165984 hence when you find no immediate cause for an effect then surely the cause existed in the past memory memory is like space empty all creation here is an effect of that emptiness and hence the creation is empty too even as the birth of your husband is an illusory product of memory i see all this as the illusory and unreal effect of imagination
3165985 death is but waking from a dream birth which arises from a wish is no more real than the wish like waves in a mirage
3165986 there is no essential difference between the experiences of this world and those of another all this being the thought forms in the infinite consciousness they are like two waves in the same ocean since the worlds were never created they will never cease to be such is the law their real nature is consciousness
3165987 the self projections of the jivas souls dwelling in those universes gave them their forms and nature
3165988 immediately after death the state in which it may be said that one is neither here nor there that state is known as pradhana or the material or inert state of consciousness it is this which is responsible both for memory and its absence and therefore for the next birth when the ethereal nature becomes awakened and when in its consciousness the ego sense manifests itself it gives rise to all the rest of the material needed for physical birth and existence
3165989 when the idea i am a body becomes deeply ingrained this same ethereal body develops the physical characteristics of a body like the eyes etc though all this happens only like vibrations or movements in air
3165990 one cannot say that either is real or unreal but one can only say that thier substratum alone is real
3165991 the fool one who is practicing meditation and the yogi the two latter types abandon the body and depart at their sweet will and pleasure but the fool who has not practiced being at the mercy of forces outside himself experiences great anguish at the approach of death
3165992 when life breath prana ceases the body is said to be dead or inert the life breath returns to its source air and consciousness freed from memory and tendencies remains as the self that atomic ethereal particle which is possessed of these memories and tendencies is known as the jiva and it remains there itself in the space where the body is and they refer to it as preta departed soul that jiva now abandons its ideas and what it had been seeing till then and perceives other things as in dreaming after a momentary lapse of consciousness the jiva begins to fancy that it sees another body another world and another life span
3165993 whatever one thinks within oneself in his own intelligence that alone is experienced by him even as nectar is experienced as poison by him who fancies it as poison friends become enemies and enemies become friends depending on ones inner attitude
3165994 the world is nothing but a mere vibration of consciousness in space it is like a marvelous dream of a person who is awake
3165995 that is because the intelligence of all the jivas is based upon the one infinite consciousness
3165996 weve got a lot of people patting us on the back
3165997 we dont believe in hype theres no such thing as hype
3165998 we dont want to earn respect we want to take respect we dont want you to just give us respect we want to take it from you
3165999 we handle expectation levels by asking your players how hard are you working what are you doing every practice
3166000 if there are changes in that there are red flags flopping around
3166001 thats how you deal with expectations every day are you taking care of your stuff when i see any red flags its my job to get it straightened out
3166002 it is do or die for us the seniors anyway
3166003 i cant get any more excited for a season its my last season of college football im going to take every bit of it and enjoy every bit of it
3166004 theyre trying to tell us they dont want to go back that way theyve been there
3166005 theyve been there when we went 5 6 theyve been there when we went 8 5
3166006 the programs come a long way those guys have been there since day one theyve seen the good the bad and the ugly
3166007 we used to be the hunter now were the hunted
3166008 our depth is young but very athletic the defense has got a chance to be pretty good
3166009 maybe were under the radar but were not complaining about the great offense weve got junior linebacker sean weatherspoon said
3166010 we definitely love the way they play if we keep it under the radar maybe we can surprise some people
3166011 nobody else from my hometown jasper texas can say theyve been on the cover of sports illustrated

3166015 desde hace un mes y medio que no se registran nuevos casos de rabia
3166016 desde hace un mes y medio que no se registran casos de rabia en la ciudad
3166017 perrera continuar levantando los animales de la v a p blica hasta que los vecinos tomen conciencia de que las mascotas no deben estar en las calles
3166018 tanto en el edificio 4 de junio como en la delegaci n de alto comedero se continua vacunando y s esta trabajando intensamente en la campa a de concientizaci n en cuanto a que el vecino no debe dejar las mascotas o el animal suelo en la calle para nosotros la continuidad de la lucha contra la rabia es fundamentalmente que el animal no est en la calle
3166019 estamos esperando que salga un decreto de la presidenta en lo que ya hemos trabajado con el cual se va a iniciar el proceso para dejar sin efecto la concesi n que hoy tiene la uni n ferroviaria
3166020 transmitir un ferrocarril no es cosa f cil no es un kiosco
3166021 obviamente no funciona como quisi ramos y estos 22 millones de pesos que est n invirtiendo no alcanzan para revertir una situaci n de deterioro muy grande
3166022 que a nuestro criterio debe invertirse en el ramal productivo central nuestro
3166023 350 millones de d lares parece mucho pero si uno piensa en la inmensidad del sistema ferroviario belgrano ser a nada m s que un parche si no fijamos bien las prioridades
3166024 la prioridad n mero uno ser el ramal productivo que viene de salvador mazza atraviesa jujuy pasando por perico y nos comunica con el puerto de barranqueras y rosario porque este ramal es el motor para el levantamiento de todo el sistema ferroviario ya que all est la producci n de toda la regi n
3166025 para que por lo menos pueda circular aunque sea mal
3166026 nuestra idea es establecer un sistema bimodal donde el transporte automotor sea complementario y cargador del sistema ferroviario central
3166027 no debemos pensar que vamos a alcanzar una etapa en que estemos m s all de la tentaci n jes s nunca alcanz esa etapa desde el principio hasta el fin de su carrera tuvo que mantenerse en la lucha por eso puede ayudarnos a pelear la nuestra

3166032 japan is our number one energy importer for historical reasons but we would like to give preference to exports to china
3166033 we mutually complement each other they have industry and we have energy resources
3166034 sanctions are not effective nowadays because we have many options in secondary markets like china
3166035 politically the two countries share a common interest in checking the inroads being made by nato in asia the presence of outsiders does not bode well for peace and security
3166036 the visit left a very strong negative feeling about china among iranians
3166037 for china issues like human rights dont affect your relations with iran
3166038 the soft economy definitely had an impact along with record fuel prices

3166040 i was just about to spread the butter when i noticed a fairly typical small hole in the bread surrounded by a burnt black ring
3166041 then to my amazement i saw the direction and splatter patterns of the crumbs and the changing shades emanating outwards from the black hole they were identical to the chaotic dynamic non linear patterns that one would expect following the big bang
3166042 i have always been an atheist and to see my life choices validated on a piece of toast is truly astounding

3166048 our doctrine is not that we evolved from apes and we have grave concerns that the museum wants to enhance the prominence of something presented as fact which is just one theory

3166050 as a scientist im thrilled by natural selection but as a human being i abhor it as a principle for organising society
3166051 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3166052 russias actions have substantially damaged its reputation in the world
3166053 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3166054 theres really nothing that george w bush can or would or should do
3166055 this is no time for the united states to step up to the plate in any meaningful way unilaterally because what seems to be happening here once you sort through all the rhetoric is this is sort of the cold war coming back

3166058 ive had my eye out for jewett stuff not really searching too hard but i saw a nice paperback of a country doctor about a month ago i was a little surprised to see it but i grabbed it i would say that it was up next on my vacation reading list at the end of last month but i shoved mary mccarthys tcsk in there after i finish this long rambling post i plan to go up and head towards the finish of country doctor so ill be writing about it soon

3166071 i picked up one rod and said this is what im going to do i was just stubborn stubborn is what got me here
3166072 the water came up the fish were roaming they werent sitcking to the targets well i saw some bait flipping i decided to tie on a buzzbait
3166073 on heavily pressured lakes we assumed we have to downsize
3166074 back home in alabama when the fish are in the grass you can always catch them by swimming a jig
3166075 it puts out a bigger profile than a silicone skirt
3166076 when the lightest man in the field brings in the heaviest fish whats up with that
3166077 i would not have caught what i did today if not for marty stone
3166078 mary put a stuffed animal in my boat she calls it the love monkey
3166079 some stretches where i can do what i like to do
3166080 then i caught my 2 biggest bass on back to back casts i had been fishing deep all week and that wasnt working for me anymore
3166081 if i make the cut it will be because of those two flips with 10 minutes to go
3166082 you work hard and want to do well for your sponsors and get that recognition for them they really lose when i miss the cut
3166083 i dont think ill catch any real giant fish in there
3166084 but i feel like i can go in there and catch 12 15 pounds
3166085 i like to fish shallow so i put the trolling motor down and said lets go find some bigger fish
3166086 get a gamakatsu stinger hook you know the ones with a string attached to the eye
3166087 snug that string on the main hook and sink the stingers hook point right in there
3166088 the technology behind this material came from skin graft technology we use a biometric material to reinforce the plastic it has a 90 pound breaking strength we have caught 200 bass on one worm this wil revolutionize the softbait industry
3166089 you will hook 70 more fish with this model as compared to a single hook

3166117 but a pcl posterior cruciate ligament you think 10 weeks and i thought the season but its amazing how quickly the strength comes back and how much your fitness can come back
3166118 now it feels good and im ready to play again
3166119 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow
3166120 butterflies going my hands are sweating my heart is pounding but i try to look very calm on the outside
3166121 the feeling it gave us was an older brother who was lighting the flame
3166122 it was very exciting and moreover it was on our home soil
3166123 yummy yummy yummy this girl has to feed my tummy
3166124 shut up gerald youve only been a dude for a few weeks now
3166125 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3166126 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3166127 its nice to be known for something good like that
3166128 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3166129 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3166130 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3166131 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning
3166132 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3166133 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course theres three weeks to go i like both of them a lot so i dont think you can say that rocco choked yesterday and i really dont think j b has any choke in him

3166137 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that

3166143 consider it pure joy when you suffer trials of many kinds
3166144 some fronts may be followed by chilling southerly winds with hail and or sleet
3166145 since there was no significant broad scale influence on our weather patterns during the next few months it opened the possibility for more variability and variety
3166146 we do not expect any one particular pattern to dominate for any more than a week or two
3166147 occasional polar blasts that bring chilling winds from the southern ocean are also on the menu

3166150 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3166151 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3166152 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them
3166153 we have four children and when we go on vacation they always go with us
3166154 i am an old timer these are the kinds of parents who will think nothing of purchasing a pool hummer 300 leather jacket camper boat cell phone and cable tv but when it comes down to day care they will always seek to find the best deal
3166155 what parents today dont realize is that there is a price to pay for these big ticket items the price is working lots of overtime and away from family time and kid time take your kids or dont go on vacation
3166156 the idea of parents needing to get away from their children once in a while reflects a deep rooted attitude that is the basis for a number of marital problems
3166157 if one or both partners refuse to give up their personal needs so that the relationship can grow there are problems
3166158 what a terrible feeling to think someone especially your parents needs their space from you husbands wives and parents want to continue with all their needs and wants regardless of who it hurts if parents spent more time with their kids instead of running off on their getaways maybe they would be aware of their childrens needs and problems
3166159 my daughter has a 3 year old son and a special needs 10 month old daughter my son has an infant daughter and we welcome the opportunity to care for her too
3166160 when we are caring for our grandson the emphasis is on him and his well being we let him know he is loved and that he is safe and secure
3166161 their parents will return renewed and happy to see their children
3166162 my 5 year old daughter was anxious about going to her first camp this summer she did fine but cried some the first day now she is nervous about starting kindergarten what about tips for reducing school anxiety
3166163 look mommy hes fill in the blank with some distinguishing physical characteristic
3166164 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3166165 umg incurs practically no expenses or risks in connection with the masters particularly with respect to licensing other companies such as apple to create and distribute digital downloads yet umg reaps millions of dollars every year from such exploitation
3166166 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3166167 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3166168 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3166169 wednesday night is thematically about securing americas future it is about honoring our veterans and the families of our veterans and how to make us safer and move past the divisiveness and into the future
3166170 i think anyone sen obama picks as vice president will be more than prepared to address those issues
3166171 as to exactly what has happened we have nothing to suggest anything sinister about his disappearance but obviously we do have to locate him one way or another
3166172 he knew he was going to play in the majors and it showed
3166173 it was great for me it was an honor to be able to manage him and all those guys i loved it

3166187 blinded the minds of the unbelieving so they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
3166188 there is none righteous not even one there is none who understands there is none who seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become useless there is none who does good there is not even one

3166192 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna
3166193 now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3166194 the growing trend of companies tailoring internet advertising based upon consumers internet search surfing and other use
3166195 how companies may be engaged in efforts to target internet advertising the impact of such efforts on consumers and broader public policy implications

3166197 el mundo es peque o mir vos finalmente pude conocerte
3166198 what i love about jeremy gilley and the peace one day campaign is that the whole thing was started by just one individual who is trying to make a difference despite the odds we all have so much potential but we dont tend to realize it so we take it for granted the work of peace one day encourages and inspires people to think about what we can all do both at individual and collective levels there are better and alternative means to conflict resolution than killing and maiming the enemy political leaders and power brokers have too much invested in the industry of war rather than implementing peaceful solutions what is life without peace peace is for the highest good and as a global community it is one of the things we need to value above everything

3166419 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3166420 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3166421 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3166422 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3166423 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force

3166533 one of the challenges is that these things are just flying all over the hemisphere
3166534 so to figure out the needs of these birds sorting out the why requires this huge geographic understanding of the populations and nobody really has that
3166535 documenting this is critical because you cant get groups to act unless you have good data to justify the action
3166536 but when youre dealing with birds that are moving so much it becomes very difficult

3166552 i n 1864 the wartime congress dissolved the indian farms established by an earlier us government indian agent and provided for the extinguishment of indian title in utah territory by treaty
3166553 above all he opposed the customary frontier theory that the only good indian was a dead indian and the resulting practice of indiscriminately killing indians
3166554 in 1849 timpanogos utes from utah valley raided the range in tooele valley west of salt lake city forty mormon militiamen rode off in pursuit surrounding the band and killed several of the indians at a location known thereafter as battle creek now pleasant grove
3166555 e arly mormon religious beliefs pertaining to the natives of the new world made relations between the older inhabitants of utah and the white newcomers more complex and at times contradictory than this seemingly sensible dictum would suggest
3166556 mormon treatment of the natives in utah vacillated unpredicatably between generosity and extermination campaigns that sometimes failed to discriminate between hostile and friendly

3166561 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3166562 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3166563 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3166564 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3166565 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3166566 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3166567 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3166568 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3166569 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3166570 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3166571 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3166572 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3166573 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3166574 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3166575 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3166576 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3166577 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3166578 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3166579 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3166580 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3166581 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3166582 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3166583 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3166584 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3166585 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3166586 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3166587 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3166588 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3166589 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3166590 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3166591 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3166592 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3166593 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3166594 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3166601 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3166602 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3166603 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3166604 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3166605 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3166606 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3166610 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3166612 all these things i will give you if you will fall down and worship me

3166614 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3166615 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3166616 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3166617 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3166618 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3166619 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3166620 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3166621 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3166622 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3166623 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3166624 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3166625 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3166626 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3166627 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3166628 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3166629 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3166630 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3166631 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3166632 that the matter of the relocation of our domestic operations out of the murtala mohammed international airport ikeja mmia is currently before the court of appeal for its consideration and has been slated for hearing on october 7 at the court of appeal lagos and is therefore that all parties to the matter have been duly notified by the court of appeal and as such any action taken by anybody thereon is premature and that virgin nigeria has not taken any definitive steps to move out of the murtala mohammed international airport while we appreciate the governments intention for us to relocate our domestic operations out of murtala mohammed international airport we are conscious of the fact that there are agreements between the federal government of nigeria and other parties which conflict with the legal stipulations under which virgin nigeria was created and which required virgin nigeria to establish a hub at the murtala mohammed international airport lagos we are however desirous of finding a middle ground that benefits all parties it our belief in the rule of law and due process that strengthens us as we await the final determination of the matter by the court of appeal we remain committed to giving our customers the best service at all times and would be providing more up to date information on our domestic schedule as events unfold we wish therefore to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience during this period
3166633 to this effect i am glad to inform you that president yaradua has approved a yearly subvention of n500 million for the centre while our administration has also budgeted about one billion naira for its take off

3166635 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3166636 would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo of south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3166637 but to our surprise it is not included in the 2008 budget amendment bill

3166646 imagine if christians were commonly denied custody of their own children by judges who declared that attendance at christian churches and maintaining a christian education were contrary to the childrens best interests the outcry against such a violation of basic liberties would be incredible and the christians would be right to be so upset

3166657 he explicado en t rminos reales que el cese al fuego debe ser la f rmula para terminar con el derramamiento de sangre es decir que georgia se retire de osetia del sur
3166658 let us not picket those organisations struggling to exist but deliberate on how we can promote production because there can be no economic growth and development without industrialisation

3166670 non ci pu essere alcun indagato in lista e il pd avendo fallito non pu presentare il presidente il programma poi si vedr nel merito concreto
3166671 non ci sono le condizioni per governare insieme finch il peso della sinistra di un decimo rispetto al pd e il pd ha questa linea
3166672 su tutti i punti fondamentali quando il pd ha dovuto scegliere non ha scelto la mediazione con rifondazione comunista ma la mediazione con i poteri forti il vaticano le banche le assicurazioni e confindustria

3166817 el gobierno nacional si no quiere a los trabajadores manifestando en plaza de mayo o en las calles debe dar una repuesta positiva e inmediata a la demanda de esta central de trabajadores porque de nada sirven las reuniones con un funcionario de turno cuando un trabajador no puede llevar los alimentos b sicos a su mesa

3166824 this new plan september 2014 aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be the available resources
3166825 we are slowing down the work to match and stay under our available funding and to do that we had to go to a later date
3166826 we are adhering to our commitment date of march 2015 for initial operating capability
3166827 our confidence that the gap will get no worse than five years has actually improved
3166828 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year
3166829 we are not just blindly cutting out redundancy or robustness in this design process
3166830 i could not be more pleased with the progress we are making
3166831 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3166832 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3166833 if mothers who lack resources such as education marital stability income and healthy environments do not receive support to breastfeed the health and well being gap between children born to women with resources and those born to disadvantaged mothers will only widen

3166836 in the case of patients who use proton pump inhibitors this equilibrium
3166837 should be reconsidered with knowledge of the mounting yet incomplete evidence suggesting that proton pump inhibitors increase the risk of fracture
3166838 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable
3166839 new yorkers have always given blood when faced with a crisis
3166840 but its difficult to give blood when there are no facilities by where you work or live and driving isnt an option we need to stop the boom and bust cycle or blood donation and more mobile vans will do that expanding the mobile donation center program makes sense so that we can expand the number of new yorkers who want to give blood but dont have access to donation sites new yorkers have generous hearts we just need to make it easier for them
3166841 patient care is now threatened based on an extremely tight three day blood supply
3166842 we certainly welcome the publics help to get through this emergency period and were always looking for ways to prevent future emergencies
3166843 we get an overview that we cant get through the community health centres
3166844 this can provide information back on priority areas for the future
3166845 if i live in paulatuk and i see this ship coming in the technology is coming to me rather than i have to go to inuvik down to yellowknife down to edmonton to have access to these services
3166846 i would feel a sense of responsibility to come in and say i want to take part in this survey
3166847 its not enough to talk about we have high incidents of violence we have high incidence of people developing diabetes we have high incidents of sexually transmitted diseases this will be the foundation to begin to make changes
3166848 youre an idiot how about being partial in your reproting who are you john sterling

3166856 we were pleased to report adjusted earnings per share that exceeded our guidance as a result of managements continued cost containment and productivity initiatives as well as the result of lower interest and tax expenses while the near term market environment remains challenging particularly as it relates to product demand and inflationary pressures we believe these results confirm the strong fundamentals and resiliency of our business although demand for our metal packaging products was adversely impacted by continued weakness in the residential housing market we benefited from increases in productivity and cost containment in response to lower volume in our plastic packaging segment despite weak market conditions we were pleased with modest volume gains as the result of new products and continued cross selling efforts with our long standing metal packaging customers
3166857 while we continue to operate in a challenging market environment third quarter results and continued favorable interest and tax expenses combined with our efforts to right size our operating footprint and improve plant productivity are providing a good foundation to support current earnings and free cash flow and allow us to increase our prior adjusted eps guidance
3166858 similar to times square the las vegas strip is renowned for its high energy and visually exciting attractions people who visit the city whether theyre one of its forty million tourists or are attending one of the twenty thousand conventions held each year expect to be enticed and entertained as they make their way down the strip

3166860 these medical students represent the very best of the next generation of u s physicians
3166861 their academic achievements as well as their leadership and volunteer activities speak to their commitment to make a difference in the medical profession
3166862 the increase in average student debt loads and the declining availability of scholarship assistance threaten our ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest talent
3166863 high loan payments may deter students from following a career path into primary care medicine
3166864 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities
3166865 this movie perpetuates use of a hateful word the disability community is trying to eradicate from our countrys vocabulary although the movie is considered satire this depiction of a person with intellectual disabilities is far from funny
3166866 one of the biggest challenges for people with intellectual disabilities is when society encourages this portrayal of them
3166867 its almost the worst adversity they face people like tara can do phenomenal things shes very highly accomplished
3166868 as a person with a disability the movie didnt make me feel good
3166869 i felt really horrible hearing them say the r word so many times so easily

3166878 our concern is that municipal decision making must be based on facts and scientific evidence
3166879 and we were seeing some municipalities that were focusing on the health impacts of idling based on information that was incorrect and misleading
3166880 what i would like to see is that natural resources canada put the same amount of emphasis on these other driving behaviours that they do on idling
3166881 its gonna make it harder for every city politician to make the argument that we need to have restrictive legislation on idling its not good news for cities anywhere
3166882 i think the restaurant association should have some kind of a pro active campaign to say hey if theres a big long lineup consider walking in the door
3166883 what was silent in the father speaks in the son
3166884 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3166885 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3166886 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3166887 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books

3166902 these expressions are not simply stereotypes intuitively associated with pride and shame but rather may be biologically innate behavioral responses to success and failure
3166903 ekman had established that expressions were the universal products of evolution
3166904 the potentially risky open posture associated with pride and nonhuman primate dominance displays may have originated as a way of conveying the validity of the individuals belief in his her dominance or success
3166905 likely originated as a way of conveying acceptance of an aggressors power thereby removing the need for conflict and sparing resources
3166906 other gestures like end zone celebrations or removing ones jersey have not yet been traced to any evolutionary advantage

3166933 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3166934 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3166935 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3166936 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question

3166955 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
3166956 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says expletive you to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me

3166963 coordinated bury activity is not technically a violation of diggs tos
3166964 a close look at campaign oriented stories on digg shows that in the last 30 days at least 28 stories critical of gop sen

3166984 we believe there is disappointment on the part of someinvestors who were expecting the data to show an even greaterdegree of efficacy
3166985 it may be wrong or it may be right but thats just the way i feel
3166986 a lot of times the modern athlete thinks he needs to have a gun to protect himself
3166987 we have guys on the team that have kids you could have a gun lying around in the room under the bed anywhere kids can find anything are you willing to take that chance that somebody gets injured or your kid gets injured because of the gun
3166988 most of the time road rage comes from getting cut off guys taking your parking spot and the first thing you want to do is reach under the seat and now youre going to have problems dont do it

3167030 shortly thereafter our scientists convinced me that uv light was not an optimal solution for treating toenail fungus or for other topically related indications that we identified as early solutions for our light based technology uv light has inherent cancer causing problems that are not optimal as a potential treatment protocol consequently we shifted our focus to the near ir spectrum of light that our technology embraces today the near ir spectrum has turned out to be much more effective in a significant number of ways

3167108 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3167109 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3167110 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3167111 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3167112 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3167113 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3167114 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3167115 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3167116 were going to increase our pressure on both the state and federal governments to state exactly what theyre going to do to assist this community that has been hard hit in recent times with the closure of the tonganah mill
3167117 its not good enough in our view a month on to have this community still very much in the dark
3167118 what they need is some certainty and what they need is some hope for the future and its not good enough a month on for governments to remain silent and not to provide that hope
3167119 i would have thought there would have been ample time for the government to make an appropriate decision and get financial support out into the community where its needed
3167120 there has been quite a lot of scuttlebutt over the process

3167134 how much control you give it to them to ruin an economy

3167136 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3167137 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3167138 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3167139 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3167140 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3167141 but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3167142 if democratic processes and principles are not respected then the party will have a much bigger problem a genuine revolt of more than 18 million voters

3167154 we were like a big family and i would say above the mason dixon line motown got it
3167155 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising
3167156 i think a lot of people felt definitely for this particular ad it looked like loreal had pretty much whitewashed beyonce
3167157 a lot of african american celebrities dont want to speak out about this because they dont want to be seen as playing the race card
3167158 if beyonce wants to be silent on her personal life i can understand
3167159 if theres something that has been misconstrued set the record straight so we can learn from it
3167160 forcing us to download and reinstall the entire program for every little update and bundling quicktime too whether its new or not
3167161 so why does the itunes store still employ digital rights management drm for the majority of songs in its library blaming the record labels no longer holds water amazonmp3 and rhapsody are among a growing number of services selling drm free mp3s from all the major labels not just emi
3167162 apple seems unwilling to acknowledge that people get music from sources other than itunes how else to explain the softwares inability to monitor folders and automatically add new music to the library
3167163 earlier this year apple hopped aboard the crapware train by adding its new for windows safari browser to its software update tool which tends to appear whenever theres a new version of itunes
3167164 if youre going to keep clinging to drm apple how about giving us a music subscription service to go with it you know the kind offered by napster rhapsody and zune marketplace
3167165 itunes is like a strict schoolmarm if you dont listen to your subscribed podcasts on a frequent and regular basis the program stops downloading new episodes
3167166 next to every single item in your library songs tv shows podcasts and so a little check box its been there as long as we can remember but if the itunes help function explains its purpose that entry is really hard to find
3167167 actually its pretty simple unchecked items dont get played when youre listening to your library or a playlist likewise unchecked items dont get synced to your ipod if you enable the sync only checked songs and videos option in the devices summary menu
3167168 come on apple make nice with nbc already swallow your pride and get nbc back on board in time for september
3167169 here we are seven versions into itunes and the player still doesnt have decent dockable controls
3167170 dockable itunes toolbar with volume seek play pause and other controls and an optional song info ticker
3167171 want to use your carefully crafted years in the making playlists with another program or a non ipod player sorry theyre locked up like gold bars at fort knox while most music managers employ the industry standard m3u format for playlists itunes marches to the beat of its own proprietary format drummer
3167172 admittedly smallish ipod screens dont lend themselves well to reading on the go but the iphone and ipod touch are perfect for the job
3167173 hopefully he will come up with a job somewhere else next year
3167174 youre always trying to keep your best players and he hasnt played in two months and so im not sure how much he could do here
3167175 theres really not a spot for him to play right now
3167176 wed like to have c j help us down the stretch but he knows his elbow better than anyone else and he didnt feel he could help the club

3167187 im disgusted and annoyed that its a spanish girl who is the first positive doping test from the games
3167188 substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3167189 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3167190 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3167191 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3167192 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3167193 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3167194 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3167204 certainly this is a large number of armed robberies to connect to a certain number of individuals
3167205 our detectives have been able to determine that those two individuals were part of a larger robbing crew that had targeted at least 20 locations in the dekalb county area
3167206 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3167207 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3167208 but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3167209 played the race card from the bottom of the deck
3167210 any discussion of obamas physical appearance is going to remind white people
3167211 black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women
3167212 i think journalists should hold their fire until one can analyze the topic
3167213 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
3167214 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
3167215 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
3167216 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
3167217 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents
3167218 the decision by george w bush to hold the spp meeting in new orleans had always been particularly insensitive and arrogant three years after hurricane katrina new orleans remains a devastated community with some 200 000 former residents still unable to return home
3167219 and no amount of tweaking adjusting or adding new layers on top will make things better
3167220 its basically an opportunity for people who have wanted to systematically reduce the federal participation in infrastructure
3167221 now the whole world knows so i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
3167222 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
3167223 i was pretty shocked when i heard about it because theres a lot of people that we know on that bus
3167224 so im thinking that could have been us and it made me realize that life is really short and precious and you never know when you know it might can happen to you
3167225 even though the jury acquitted me of these charges in less than three hours my political opponents and some of the news media would likely spend the next several months vilifying me further
3167226 in mexico investigators have provided some tremendous leads to weapons trafficking organizations
3167227 tracing where these weapons are from is critical in the early stages
3167228 the proposal includes innovative plans that would finally extend the interstate system into south texas
3167229 if this isnt a wake up call to the legislature that its business as usual at txdot until they forcibly restrain them via state law we dont know what is
3167230 this removes any requirement for competitive bidding which on its face is an absolute failure of the states fiduciary duty
3167231 the new kinder smaller i 69 ttc is a welcome move in the right direction but its not all roses tomorrows announcement will remind us that all new lanes will be toll lanes the project will continue to be a public private partnership that will drive tolls to the highest level possible to generate as much revenue as possible from the motoring public while this move to scale back ttc 69 to a much more reasonable project lets not forget about ttc 35 more than 14 000 texans turned up at public hearings in central texas to personally object to that project just as stridently as those along the ttc 69 corridor in 2006 the then transportation commission chairman ric williamson declared that perrys ttc 35 trumps such opposition apparently it still does now would be a good time for txdot to demonstrate that their ttc 69 announcement is much more that just public relations its time for txdot to throw the towel in on ttc 35 and narrow that study area as well commissioner houghton touts that public involvement and local commitment are essential and we agree so lets take a step back and restart the discussion about ttc 35 and give the citizens and communities along that corridor the same respect as those along ttc 69
3167232 we need people who understand the business we need people who understand transportation we dont need someone whos unpopular with the legislature
3167233 ini vonis yang baru mendekati keadilan masyarakat seandainya adil klien saya harus bebas secara murni dong
3167234 kami pikir pikir dulu untuk banding saya harus berkoordinasi dulu dengan atasan kajati red karena semuanya ini terserah atasan yang jelas kemungkinan kami akan banding
3167235 kita menolak gugatan pemohon karena bukan menyangkut hitungan hasil akhir pilkada melainkan masalah masalah pra pencoblosan itu bukan wewenang pengadilan tinggi atau mahkamah agung melainkan kewenangan panwaslu
3167236 at the heart of my approach is a simple belief
3167237 middle class families are paying too much and oil companies arent paying their fair share to help us solve the problems at the pump
3167238 one of those few taxes that new york actually gets more money from washington than we send
3167239 entirely too high but i think it would be disingenuous and unfortunate for american consumers for them to be led to believe that there is a short term fix
3167240 the tier i development and evaluation process has not been rigorous and there has not been a proactive agency and public involvement program because the public has spoken overwhelmingly that it does not want the proposal but the proposers still push the proposal there is no balance in meeting the purpose and need and minimizing the potential for environmental effects because there is a conflict of interest in pushing the proposal forward this leads the sierra club to the believe that instead of preparing a factual and unbiased deis draft environmental impact statement the proposers are attempting to mislead and mold the opinions of the public and decision makers by misinterpretation via language of what really is at stake and exists in the i 69 ttc project area this is the very antithesis of what an eis is supposed to be and do such actions call for a withdrawal of the deis and a total reanalysis that is based on factual evidence and narrative and not manipulative and self serving language that predetermines the outcome of this proposal the effects of current actions are not considered in the analysis of whether i 69 ttc should be constructed for instance global warming and the effects it is having and the generation of greenhouse gases that roads cause the increased cost of oil up to about 100 barrel the increased cost of gasoline which is 3 gallon now and if expected to go to 4 gallon this summer the collapse of the housing market the recession that is evident in the united states economy the reduction in funds for roads due to funding two wars etc all of these and more current actions affect and should play a role in determining whether i 69 ttc should be built but there is no discussion about how these actions affect the decision of whether to build i 69 ttc
3167241 they bought the kool aid and thought republicans would be in the permanent majority
3167242 there may be hard feelings about things that happened in the past but we have significant challenges in the future
3167243 went through the same rigorous hiring process as every other applicant who applies to work for the state of texas
3167244 there has been an expression of interest in coming here and building relationships
3167245 but i still havent seen that happen at this point
3167246 have been instructed to blame congress for the inability to improve highway projects
3167247 when txdot wanted to tell us what should be built in texas it doesnt work that way
3167248 but i dont think we need to plow up a bunch of new ground on private property across the state to get there
3167249 im going to support earmarks as long as i am here breathing
3167250 this is a place for big challenges not big excuses
3167251 the legislature must understand that no is not a solution
3167252 there remain many many financial institutions who are ready willing and able to invest their money to build the roads we need
3167253 too often these debates over highways have been driven by emotion and not reason
3167254 as a result honest debate has been stifled and progress has been sacrificed on the altar of politics
3167255 over the last four years the previous leadership at txdot regrettably was tone deaf to the legislature
3167256 that resulted in last year our saying enough and passing a moratorium
3167257 today is a new day and i am committed to working with txdot in a constructive manner
3167258 so bring us your ideas and let us look at them
3167259 until a greater solution and by that i mean a long term solution becomes clear i am not willing to allow this state to simply go further into debt
3167260 we dont have enough money we dont have enough money and we dont have enough money
3167261 the bus industry is healthy right now its in a good place
3167262 when there are layoffs it means nobody is putting another nickel into their home
3167263 i went down a super steep hill super fast and it was super fun
3167264 theres been a lot of speculation as far as the stadiums completion and there being something tied into my contract theres nothing like that at all
3167265 yes could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university and i thought the commitment was there so i didnt want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
3167266 it takes smarts to think for yourself it only takes a semi good memory to act like everyone else
3167267 as in most things liberals in hollywood tend to live in the fiction fantasy world the governor lives in reality
3167268 i dont know about them but it will be perry in 2010
3167269 i dont know about the other two you need to ask them
3167270 i am encouraged by the growing number of texans asking me to return home to run for governor to provide leadership for our state it is too early to make an announcement about the 2010 race right now i remain committed to serving the people of texas in the united states senate and helping our republican candidates win crucial elections this fall
3167271 we were wanting to make sure that the public had more opportunity to comment on the document and we also had received a request from senator hutchison to do so
3167272 nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
3167273 we just keep putting money in and putting money in
3167274 its getting to be that you have to be really picky about the jobs you take

3167286 police are looking for a man who told clerks at a local adult novelty shop that he is a police detective and then demanded that they provide him with pornographic videos so he could check the ages of the actors and actresses in them the clerks turned away the ponytailed police impersonator last month said longmont cmdr tim lewis
3167287 its interesting its not scary in any way but its different
3167288 our understanding is that the late snow melt over much of ontario will delay the bears emerging from their dens
3167289 in the middle of winter if you get two or three nice days in a row you could have bears walking around
3167290 theyre not active looking for food since their food sources are virtually impossible to find a lot of their diet is based on berries and vegetation
3167291 this year the beginning of spring was colder than usual so i think temperature has just pushed them back despite the longer days
3167292 if they werent quite as well prepared if theyre a little bit more hungry then theyre probably going to be getting up earlier so they can start looking for food

3167298 laws ensuring clean water for us and our children dismissed laws protecting wildlife land rivers streams and places of cultural significance just a bother to the bush administration laws giving american citizens a voice in the process gone clearly this is out of control it is this kind of absolute disregard for the well being and concerns of border communities and the welfare of our wildlife and untamed borderlands that has forced defenders of wildlife and the sierra club to take a stand and say no more just a few weeks ago we filed a petition with the u s supreme court to fight the unconstitutional authority the bush administration has seized to waive any and all laws it views as inconvenient in its rush to build an unpopular ineffective border wall todays egregious abuse of power is more proof that this cannot be allowed to continue

3167301 lets be clear the trans texas corridor is the nafta superhighway no one who supports the trans texas corridor likes to say the words nafta superhighway they call it an urban myth if the nafta superhighway is such a myth why is the bush administration work ing so hard to let mexican trucks use our highways if the nafta superhighway is such a myth why is corporate america holding summits on the need for a huge network of freight corridors from mexico to canada if the nafta superhighway is such a myth why is mexico working with giant cor porations to expand its ports and its road and rail connections to the u s border the reason they say the nafta superhighway is a myth is because they know that the vast majority of americans dont want it

3167348 not only are we cutting down quite a bit on the amount of paint and materials needed for these types of repairs but often when i look at them i cant even tell where the dent was
3167349 in general the auto body repair industry is way behind the times
3167350 companies are doing things the way they have been done for many years and its not really an industry that has focused on environmental responsibility
3167351 we feel like we are the educators and people are happy when they find us because they feel like they are making the right choice for the environment

3167380 we waste so much breath bitching about the assholes we forget to remember the angels
3167381 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3167382 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3167383 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3167384 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3167385 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3167386 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3167387 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3167388 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3167389 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3167438 all that is not eternal is eternally out of date
3167439 in arguing against him you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all
3167440 christ died for men precisely because they were not worth it to make them worth it
3167441 some people seem to think that i began by asking myself how i could say something about christianity to children then fixed on the fairy tale as an instrument then collected information about child psychology and decided what age group id write for then drew up a list of basic christian truths and hammered out allegories to embody them this is all pure moonshine i couldnt write in that way it all began with images a faun carrying an umbrella a queen on a sledge a magnificent lion at first there wasnt anything christian about them that element pushed itself in of its own accord
3167442 i had no idea that the success with the opening of my butterfly life would be as quick as it has been
3167443 i am excited beyond words and whats even more exciting is that my ladies are loving it almost as much as i do
3167444 i feel so lucky to be a part of the butterfly life franchise
3167445 i state to every woman that comes in that this is a place to nurture herself and so far that is how they have come to view being here
3167446 weve been saying all along well make it by the 28th of august
3167447 but the part of the school that wont be ready in time is the gym
3167448 the school had to replace the entire floor and even though a lot is done now it wont be finished until late november
3167449 fortunately were part of a larger organization and thats the catholic church which has multiple gyms down here
3167450 i dont think there was a sweet cherry in door county if somebody had a sweet cherry they had the crop of sweet cherries
3167451 hopefully the apple crop will carry us through even though the apple crop is only about 10 of what we depend on for our income here so treat the apples with a little more respect this year
3167452 its going to be very difficult we havent taken care of the orchard as far as the cosmetic side of it mowing the grass that wont affect the crop
3167453 this is the first summer in 32 years that ive seen the beach down here in august my wife said its about time we had summer i said its nice but i dont want to make it a habit
3167454 rusland heeft zijn spierballen laten zien en getoond dat het in zijn invloedssfeer zich hevig zal verzetten tegen navo uitbreiding maar als het bijvoorbeeld olie en gaspijpleidingen aanvalt die deels in westerse handen zijn dan neemt de internationale betrokkenheid enorm toe daar heeft het geen belang bij dat kan te veel gevolgen hebben voor de relatie met westerse markten waar het afhankelijk van is
3167455 stop er nu mee en claim het morele gelijk in de kwestie zuid osseti of ga door veroorzaak de val van het regime in tbilisi en negeer de westerse woede er zijn signalen dat de haviken de leiding hebben en met name ex president en huidig premier poetin die met de georgische president saakasjvili vrijwel een persoonlijke vete heeft hij reageerde al boos vanuit peking uren voordat president medvedev die eigenlijk over buitenlandse politiek gaat red iets verklaarde hij vloog naar vladikavkaz om de russische aanpak te co rdineren en dreigend te voorspellen dat het georgische volk een objectief oordeel zal geven over zijn eigen leiders
3167456 het gaat niet alleen om het verwijderen van de symbolische persoon saakasjvili ze maken wel duidelijk dat ze nooit met hem willen praten en de relatie dus nooit verbetert zolang hij aan de macht is maar ze proberen ook zijn team op te breken zijn regering is in georgi het eerste coherente team sinds de onafhankelijkheid dat een duidelijke nationale agenda voert zoals een liberaal economisch beleid het elimineren van criminele clans uit het bedrijfsleven het versterken van de natiestaat als dat team uiteenvalt bestaat het risico dat georgi terugvalt naar de brute politiek van de jaren negentig toen onder president sjevardnadze maffiose groepen met elkaar de strijd aanbonden red de russen willen groepen aan de macht die hun beleid co rdineren met moskou
3167457 georgi is het ongemarkeerde graf van het westerse beleid nog ongemarkeerd omdat het westen zich nog niet realiseert dat zijn militaire beleid zijn energiebeleid en de verspreiding van internationaal recht een fatale klap wordt toegebracht
3167458 sehari hari memang sering terdengar suara anak anak itu menangis kalau keluar rumah biasanya kita tanya kenapako menangis nak katanya mereka lapar
3167459 padahal untuk anak seusia ini aco red berat idealnya 15 20 kg jadi ini positif marasmus gizi buruk
3167460 kalau mereka beli beras satu liter biasanya itu untuk mencukupi makan selama tiga hari sehari semalam mereka cuma bikin bubur satu kali
3167461 mereka juga baru lima bulan tinggal di sini sebelumnya mereka tinggal di jl bonto duri
3167462 sebenarnya kami juga selalu ingin membantu cuma suami dan istrinya itu jarang bicara jadi yang kita ajak bicara biasanya cuma anak anaknya
3167463 paling kalau makan kuahnya pakai minyak bekas penggorengan karena tidak punya uang untuk beli ikan mereka juga hanya makan garam saya tahu sebab saya sering melihat mereka makan dan memberinya ikan
3167464 dia pertama sakit pada kamis sore saat itu sepanjang malam ia menangis dan berteriak kesakitan ia sempat tidur saat jumat subuh namun hanya beberapa menit lalu terbangun lagi dan menangis kembali
3167465 setiap dikasi sarung pasti berak lagi saya tidak bisa menghitung berapa kali yang pasti puluhan kali
3167466 pak syamsuddinlah yang membacakan yasin dan menuntun untuk salawat makanya di kamarnya ada alquran
3167467 saat akan meninggal pak ustaz memegang satu tangannya dan sebelah lagi saya yang pegang saat akan meninggal basse baru terlihat tenang ia meninggal kira kira pukul 13 00 sebab saat itu baru saja selesai salat jumat
3167468 saya bahkan tidak bisa lagi tidur sejak bangun tengah malam karena dia basse red menangis dan berteriak terus
3167469 prinsip yang kami pegang sejak awal adanya kepercayaan tolotang adalah semboyan tetteng kami berpegang teguh tidak berubah dan tidak terpengaruh dengan kondisi apa pun kami bukan tidak menerima perkembangan yang ada namun prinsip tetap kami pegang teguh
3167470 banyak yang bergeser masuk islam bahkan banyak yang sudah berhaji setelah berpindah agama tidak ada lagi kewenangan mereka di tolotang pernikahan juga menjadi salah satu pemicu adanya pergeseran ini dan kami memang cukup ketat soal itu semua yang menikah di luar tolotang termasuk islam berarti sudah keluar mereka tidak diakui lagi
3167471 kami selalu rukun dan damai sebab di amparita tolotang dengan masyarakat islam memang rata rata punya hubungan famili bahkan orang islam yang tidak punya hubungan famili dengan kami hanya yang betul betul datang dari luar amparita
3167472 tolotang itu etnis bugis juga cuma bedanya dalam hal kepercayaan saja bahasa kita bahasa bugis juga
3167473 sebagai komunitas yang terbuka memang tidak menutup kemungkinan ada warga kita yang keluar dari tolotang tapi memang dipersilakan saja tidak dipermasalahkan tapi sebaliknya juga demikian ada juga penganut lain yang mau bergabung dengan kami hanya memang hal itu sangat sulit bahkan bisa jadi tertutup sebab prinsip kami tolotang tidak berkembang dengan menerima orang lain kami tidak pernah seperti itu kita berkembang berdasarkan anak cucu
3167474 di amparita ada dua tolotang ada yang menamakan diri tolotang benteng tapi kami tidak pernah mengenal dua kami tidak tahu siapa yang mengatasnamakan itu yang pasti kamilah tolotang asli yang punya paham hindu dalam ritual mereka tidak lagi diikutkan tapi konon kabarnya mereka juga punya uwa tapi silakan saja jalan kita jangan saling ganggu
3167475 kita selalu terbuka saling bahu membahu cuma tak dapat dipungkiri juga dalam proses sejarah membangun kebersamaan itu tak mudah ada bukti sejarah yang tidak tersembunyi bahwa pernah juga terjadi gesekan ada sekelompok orang yang memiliki keinginan keras memaksakan kehendak tapi kita klaim itu hanya oknum beberapa orang saja saya tidak generalkan
3167476 im a computer technician if people wont switch to vista fine by me ill see their computers in a couple months loaded with viruses adware spyware kits and all and get paid to fix them all because they didnt switch to a newer more secure os that can prevent them
3167477 saya sudah beberapa tahun tinggal di sekitar sini pastinya saya tidak ingat lagi namun kira kira sepuluh tahun sebelum di tempat tenda ini saya tinggal di lokasi bangunan alfa juga dengan tenda saat alfa mulai dibangun saya pindah ke sini
3167478 saya sudah terbiasa saya memasak makan dan tidur di sini kemarin dua hari lalu red saya juga sempat membeli ikan rp2 000
3167479 lampu jalan cukup terang makanya saya tidak mencari lampu sendiri kalau malam saya tidur ditemani kucing nyamuk juga banyak tapi saya sudah terbiasa
3167480 saya biasa dikasi uang sama orang uang tersebutlah yang saya pakai beli beras ikan serta peralatan masak
3167481 saya sebenarnya orang leureng siwa sengkang saya juga punya rumah di sana namun diusir orang barang barang saya juga diambil kalau di makassar ini saya tidak punya rumah jadi saya tinggal di tenda saja
3167482 saya melahirkan anak sepuluh tiga di antaranya meninggal ada juga di antara anak saya sopir mobil setelah suami pertama saya meninggal saya sempat kawin lagi namun akhirnya saya tinggalkan
3167483 dulu pedagang dari sulsel juga melanglangbuana ke luar negeri mereka menggunakan kapal paddewakang dan banawa khusus banawa digunakan sebagai kapal pengekspor ternak
3167484 khusus untuk perang terutama melakukan penyergapan dulu nenek moyang kita menggunakan kapal binta ini paling ditakuti bangsa asing
3167485 nenek moyang kita dulu juga sudah mengenal mukenah pakaian salat red hanya saja mukenahnya agak lain sebab penutup badan dan kepala terpisah model mukenah itu bisa dilihat dalam pameran ini
3167486 tahun 1854 matthes menerbitkan kamus bugis belanda makassar belanda ternyata dalam kamus itu banyak kata kata yang tak dimengerti artinya oleh orang eropa makanya dikirimlah dua orang la schroder jr dan nap eilers untuk melukis benda benda dalam kamus yang tak dimengerti
3167487 kami sengaja memfoto ulang semua hasil karya itu untuk memperkenalkan ke masyarakat bahwa kita punya kebudayaan dan peninggalan sejarah yang luar biasa namun proses foto dan scan ini tidaklah mudah sebab sebagai peninggalan sejarah dan kebudayaan kami harus melakukan prosesi khusus termasuk menyiapkan daun sirih sebenarnya tak masuk akal namun begitulah kenyataannya saat mulai bekerja kami didatangi orang tua yang meminta dilakukan prosesi itu
3167488 potensi minyak ambalat selalu menjadi incaran malaysia makanya berdasarkan instruksi panglima tni au kita selalu melakukan operasi di sini operasi ini kami lakukan untuk mengetahui kondisi ambalat
3167489 sejak beberapa waktu lalu malaysia telah menyiagakan pesawat tempurnya di tawau sementara kita tidak pimpinan tni berpikir bahwa sangat penting juga kita menempatkan pesawat pengamanan di daerah perbatasan makanya kita berharap ini akan segera terbentuk untuk mengcover seluruh wilayah perbatasan mudah mudahan 2009 mendatang sudah bisa dimanfaatkan
3167490 saat itu dia basse red datang bersama suami dan anak anaknya mereka hanya membawa kantongan plastik berisi pakaian ia bahkan tinggal serumah dengan saya selama tiga tahun
3167491 bayangkan saja rata rata ia hanya diberi uang rp5 ribu per hari oleh suaminya yang kerap pulang dalam keadaan mabuk uang itu dia belikan beras setengah liter dan minyak tanah setengah liter kalau ada lebihnya ia berikan untuk belanja anak anaknya tapi ia tidak pernah mengeluh kami dapat cerita itu saat memaksanya bicara jika anak anaknya lagi menangis kelaparan
3167492 saya bilang ke basse bagaimana kalau anak anaknya lapar dan tidak ada tetangga yang membantu namun mereka pindah juga saat itu ia meninggalkan rumah dengan karung karung berisi pakaian
3167493 saya ketemu di jalan lalu saya ajak ke rumah ternyata mereka mau
3167494 dia lebih banyak memasak bubur katanya untuk mengirit beras yang dia beli
3167495 katanya tidak usah melapor ke rt rw nanti menyusahkan orang saja begitulah sampai ia meninggal
3167496 saya serahkan kamu yang rawat anak saya saya sudah tidak mampu lagi
3167497 saya kasihan istri saya dan anak saya meninggal saya tidak mau minum mabuk red lagi
3167498 dikubur dekat warung yang ada di kebun saya biasa duduk duduk di warung itu saya kuburkan di situ supaya sering saya lihat
3167499 bukan bahar yang meninggal tapi bahri memang kau sering marah marah sama mamaku
3167500 lokasi rumah saya ini dulunya dikenal keramat jika sudah malam warga takut melintas selain itu bukit ini juga menjadi sarang biawak dan ular makanya wajar kalau beberapa warga menilai saya sudah gila dan bodoh waktu itu
3167501 malah bupati pangkep syafrudin nur juga pernah ke sini juni lalu ia sempat memberi uang ke anak saya
3167502 meski harus tinggal di bukit batu saya tetap bahagia bahkan saya bersyukur kami punya tempat sendiri lagi pula saya mau kemana kalau bukan di sini kami tak punya apa apa
3167503 anak sekampung sebayanya malah sering berkumpul di sini untuk bermain
3167504 saya juga heran melihat kondisi rumah kami mereka seharusnya sering sakit namun ternyata tidak kalau dipanggil neneknya mereka dengan lugu mengatakan tidak mau sebab katanya adaji rumahnya sendiri mereka mau hidup susah bersama kami
3167505 kemungkinan itu pengaruh dari air yang berada di bawah rumah kami sebab memang beberapa sisi itu lowong di bawahnya itu kami jadikan kolam dan kita tempati memelihara ikan lele dan mujair
3167506 kalau mau buang air besar juga numpang di wc tetangga tapi dalam waktu dekat saya akan membuat wc tembok untuk persiapan tempat penampungannya juga sudah ada
3167507 sekarang saya sedang hamil delapan bulan dan untuk melengkapi kebahagian di rumah ini kami berharap anak laki laki
3167508 biasanya taking kembali dari pasar sekira jam empat sore maklum karena pulang pergi ke pasar membawa kayu ia hanya jalan kaki jarak ke pasar kurang lebih dua kilo
3167509 tanah taking digunakan sebagai pemakaman umum warga yang meninggal dikubur di situ ia juga tidak pernah protes
3167510 setiap panen puluhan warga berangkat hingga ke maros untuk memanen padi hasilnya bisa hidup beberapa bulan kalau untuk makan tidak susah di sini
3167511 tapi banyak di antaranya yang gengsi dan enggan dikatakan miskin setiap datang ke kampung basri memang selalu berlagak bos
3167512 kalau orangtua basse saya tidak tahu namanya sebab memang sudah meninggal semenjak basse masih kecil tapi menantu saya itu memang orangnya sangat sabar saya tidak pernah mendengarnya mengeluh
3167513 saya tidak tahu ternyata mereka menderita bersama anak anaknya di makassar
3167514 waktu itu saya sangat terdesak saya bingung tapi karena tekad saya sudah bulat untuk hidup mandiri dan jauh dari bayang bayang orangtua saya pun akhirnya memutuskan tinggal di bukit ini setelah sebelumnya minta izin ke pemilik sawah di sekitarnya saat itu di bukit ini ada sebuah gua yang untuk masuk di dalamnya kita harus berjalan miring di situlah saya tinggal hingga saat ini
3167515 sebagai keluarga yang tidak punya apa apa saya datang ke gua ini hanya membawa beberapa peralatan makan dan tidur tempat tidur pertama kami adalah balai balai dari kayu dengan penopang batang pohon
3167516 sebagai pekerja bangunan saya punya jiwa seni saya selalu ingin berkreasi makanya sedikit demi sedikit saya mulai bekerja untuk mengubah rumah batu saya ini betul betul seperti rumah sambil tetap bekerja untuk menyambung hidup beberapa bagian bukit saya bakar dengan ban butuh 34 buah ban hingga akhirnya beberapa bagian bukit bukti ini runtuh termasuk untuk pintu masuk saya juga membuatnya
3167517 kalau sudah dibakar dengan ban batu batu jadi agak mudah dirubuhkan itulah yang terus saya lakukan sambil memahat bagian bagian yang perlu diratakan dari hasil bekerja dan bantuan orang lain saya juga sudah bisa membuat pondasi di sekeliling rumah
3167518 kalau ada uang ruang tamu dan kamar di bagian tengah bukit akan saya kerja tapi untuk sementara saya tinggal di dapur yang menjadi tempat makan sekaligus tidur kami malah di puncak bukit saya juga berniat membuat tempat istirahat dan musalah
3167519 sekarang saya sudah punya rumah sendiri meski pun memprihatinkan tapi saya dan keluarga sudah sangat bahagia setelah bukit saya belah awalnya saya memakai tenda untuk atap namun sejak beberapa hari lalu atap yang sudah berganti tiga kali saya ganti lagi dengan atap rumbia saat ganti atap saya sempat menangis sebab cuaca cerah tiba tiba berganti hujan dan anak anak serta istri saya yang hamil tua ikut kehujanan saya terharu saat itu
3167520 bapak sempat dirawat beberapa jam sebelum meninggal kami kurang tahu pasti penyakitnya yang jelas sebelumnya bapak disimpulkan kena penyakit ginjal
3167521 sehari sebelumnya bapak mengatakan akan memberi saya kado ultah istimewa hari ini kemarin red saat itu saya hanya bilang tidak usah pikir kado bapak panjang umur saja itu yang penting perkataan bapak saat itu saya pikir sebuah pertanda bahwa ajalnya segera tiba
3167522 bapak sejak tahun 50 an sudah di psm bapak juga sempat menjadi kapten timnas saat itu kalau tidak salah tahun 1956 bapak menjadi kapten di asian games di manila bapak juga pernah membawa psm juara bersama mangandaan selain itu bapak juga pernah melatih makassar utama
3167523 karier beliau sangat sempurna kami banyak berguru kepadanya saat masih hidup beliau keturunan ambon belanda tapi jiwa makassarnya sangat kental sangat sedikit sosok pesepak bola yang memiliki karakter seperti dia
3167524 dia pelaku sejarah mulai dari era ramang sampai era kami dan menjadi pelatih
3167525 dia sosok pekerja keras dan punya disiplin tinggi semua itu ditularkan ke kami saat menangani kami ia sangat keras tapi hasilnya memang bagus
3167526 paling berkesan saat sunar arlan dipanggil timnas tahun 1947 sunar yang dipanggil untuk persiapan asian games di new delhi menjadi pemain psm pertama di timnas saat itu berselang tujuh tahun kemudian sunar yang berposisi bek kiri dipanggil lagi namun sudah cedera makanya dipanggillah trio psm nus husein serta ramang meski begitu karena timnas butuh bek kiri nus dan husein dipulangkan hanya ramang yang bertahan karena salah seorang striker cedera kala itu
3167527 dia memang gelandang psm yang bagus sulit mencari sosok pemain seperti dia lagi

3167531 satan isnt attacking the church anymore because its right where he wants it

3167533 wow a b c d and e got one i think ill fit in more if i get one too
3167534 if anything i was more surprised with her conduct to continue to allow her dogs to trespass on this property after she had agreed to cease and desist
3167535 from this point forward she began to constantly walk the dogs in our yard
3167536 i would tell her to get the dogs out of the yard always hearing the same responses it is not your yard stating we are harassing her yelling obscenities giving visual obscenities etc
3167537 the dog walking was is an almost every day event
3167538 this is just something she does it became an issue for my dogs even touching a blade of grass on the same street we live on
3167539 i think both of them are pushing it past where it needs to go
3167540 a lot of this has to do more with some ongoing dispute with neighbors than it does with the animal in the middle of it
3167541 did i think id be dragged away and off to prison absolutely not
3167542 a passage of acheron like solemnity and darkness now all closed and filled up and soon to be utterly forgotten
3167543 peoples picture of ground zero is of horrendous destruction but the elements that werent destroyed that survived are an important symbol because people did survive and just as importantly the city survived
3167544 when you walk along that corridor you understand you are walking along a path that millions of people took everyday some of whom are no longer with us it gives you pause
3167545 it will be a symbol of the rebirth of a critical part of the city
3167546 he was obsessed with coming up with a better kind of manure
3167547 but adams took great pride in the fact that he was a real farmer and it was emblematic of his being a real person
3167548 i think its as close as anything has ever been to bringing those people and that timealive in a fashion that i dont think people will ever forget
3167549 it was very important to all of us that it be a sensory experience
3167550 we tend to think of them as godlike characters marble deities or folk figures
3167551 we have stereotypes about what the declaration of independence was and who these men were
3167552 we know they were great men but why were they great men
3167553 and yet a man whos impetuously impulsive and often acts without thinking hes humble yet madly ambitious he was a simple man who was very vain he was a man who loved his family yet spent half his life away from them and paul is fearless in portraying all of this warts and all
3167554 neurotic and he was depressive and he was a hypochondriac he would have complete collapses and it was never entirely clear what was wrong with him
3167555 theyre not getting the money they expected but in retrospect maybe they should have held off on the good news announcements
3167556 they trotted them out to take the edge off the fare hike
3167557 i think that if theyre charging us more then the service should improve
3167558 trying to predict what the future is in these volatile markets is something we cant do
3167559 your actions have hurt not just two americans but they have hurt the way americans will view china during the games the way all the people of the world will view china the bright dream of these momentous olympics has been darkened by you
3167560 he had lost all hope after a series of failures in his life and took his anger out on society
3167561 he had a quick temper and was always complaining about society
3167562 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3167563 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3167564 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3167565 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3167566 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3167567 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3167568 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3167569 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3167570 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3167571 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3167572 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3167573 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3167574 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3167575 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3167576 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3167577 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3167578 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3167579 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3167580 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3167581 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

3167583 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3167584 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3167585 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3167586 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3167587 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3167588 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3167589 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3167590 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3167591 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3167592 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3167593 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3167594 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3167595 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3167596 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3167597 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3167598 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

3167616 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3167617 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3167618 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3167619 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3167620 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3167621 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3167622 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3167623 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3167624 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3167625 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3167626 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3167627 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3167628 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3167629 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3167630 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3167631 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3167632 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3167633 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3167634 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3167635 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3167636 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3167637 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3167638 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3167639 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3167640 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3167641 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3167642 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3167643 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3167644 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3167645 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3167646 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3167647 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3167648 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3167649 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3167650 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3167651 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3167652 ele sempre teve o desejo de pagar mas como a execu o estava um pouco tumultuada precis vamos apurar esse valor e de fato ele estava errado porque a ju za aceitou reduzi lo
3167653 the abuse was horrendous it was physical as well as psychological it was torture
3167654 when youre locked up in such a place and treated so horrifically they dont exactly give you a calendar but she says it was a very long time years for sure they her captors were americans theres no doubt about it
3167655 are manipuris indians if yes why are we being treated as third class citizens
3167656 as an indian we should have been proud of the first individual gold but it has failed to cheer up manipuris after the shabby treatment meted out to our monika devi
3167657 this is no longer a political crisis in the state
3167658 this is now a fullblown national crisis that could require extraordinary measures
3167659 we want to ask the government who is responsible for the death of sheikh aziz and four other innocent kashmiris and only then shall we disclose out future course
3167660 this could be worse than 1990 because the valley is intent on pushing into pakistan occupied kashmir and nobody seems in control sheikh azizs killing will give greater momentum to a movement that has erupted out of nowhere
3167661 ever since the court ruling to delete the scene i have had a number of industry people seniors as well as contemporaries calling up to congratulate me for having taken on the might of these people
3167662 shah rukh and farah khan betrayed me when they continued with the screening of the scene even after they assured me many months ago that it would be deleted without further delay even when i met shah rukh at an awards function at the beginning of this year he was respectful and affectionate but not once did he mention that the controversial scene had not been done away with
3167663 to say that i am thriving on cheap publicity from om shanti om is the worst thing that anyone can ever think of they should repent and apologise for all that they have said i am still giving them a chance
3167664 it was yash chopra who acted as the mediator and brought shah rukh and farah to my house when the issue first flared up when i recently told him the scene had not been deleted he was shocked but then shah rukh is his leading man so there is nothing much that he can do or say
3167665 i have been made to go through immense mental agony and will leave no stone unturned to ensure that they are made to apologise for all that has been said
3167666 if you keep your cool and retain the concentration you will get the medal
3167667 he was a sports buff and a good student too you could easily identify him in a group since he was such a remarkably cool guy he never got too excited about anything nor too depressed
3167668 he had an uncluttered mind and never toyed with too many ideas he was choosy about which sport he would take up
3167669 abhinav liked shooting although a shooter had to keep standing for long hours with the rifle for practice but he would do it
3167670 i believe shooting is a mental game because it demands concentration i saw bindra reaching an extraordinary level of concentration during shooting practice what brought him the gold is his abundant patience and concentration
3167671 would it be olympian or abhinav we dont know yet anyway it would be a gift to dehra dun
3167672 cant really describe how i felt at that particular moment
3167673 shooting is 99 per cent luck and one per cent training
3167674 abhinav will you marry me my parents will have to buy that much less gold now
3167675 yes i have already started the search for a bride
3167676 now i have lots of work ahead as he is the countrys most eligible bachelor
3167677 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3167678 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3167679 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3167680 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3167681 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that

3167684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3167685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3167686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3167687 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3167688 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3167689 the album reflects the singer songwriters far ranging influences including brazilian percussion on the title track detroit gospel choirs a stevie wonder inspired crazy complete with funky banjo and the tempestuous latin flavored track i want you to a collaboration originally earmarked for a solo album by turntable whiz cut chemist
3167690 its one of the favorites on the new disc so we cant wait for people to hear it we had a really good time working with brian for the video too and were very happy with his work
3167691 kids come out and go totally bonkers or wait in line for two or three hours just to say whats up its really amazing to be a part of this
3167692 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3167693 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3167694 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3167695 well you missed the great returns on that fund but we have another one
3167696 the individual defendants have staked their ability to extricate themselves from these frauds on the success of their diamond mining investments in africa
3167697 my family does not know whether i am dead or alive we are not allowed to use phones so i was looking forward to my holiday but now i am too scared to leave because the taliban are waiting just outside and i will get killed
3167698 my boss said the flights are for priority staff only it seems some human life is more valuable than others
3167699 when we started here just over a year ago the situation wasnt as bad but now the taliban are increasing their attacks on us we need the company to give us protection i am speaking on behalf of all of us here in bastion
3167700 when i signed up for the job kbr promised to look after me and provide me security but none of this has happened they just threaten to sack us if we complain
3167701 i saw him leaving the night before and the next morning he was dead its very sad news for us he was a friend
3167702 they said at the interview that we could have access to a doctor but we are not even allowed to go to the clinic on the base
3167703 the safety and security of all employees remains kbrs top priority for locally recruited employees at camp bastion kbr has a process in place to monitor local security and safety on a daily basis
3167704 employees at camp bastion live in tents that differ from those provided to the british military the employee tents are equipped with air conditioning kbr also provides a contracted medical doctor on site and all employees have access to british military hospital facilities at camp bastion in an effort to ensure safe travel kbr offers employees the opportunity to fly via british military from camp bastion to kabul when taking leave
3167705 he had a pop at me before the last dive when we were sitting down
3167706 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do thats just thomas hes over nervous and thats how it was today thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3167707 when tom hears about this i dont suppose hell want to dive with him again
3167708 if you cant take it on the chin you shouldnt be there perhaps blakes got sour grapes its easy to blame a 14 year old but its not exactly team spirit
3167709 its a synchro team theres two of us and thats the hard thing about it
3167710 both of you have to be on your game at the same time and that just didnt happen today
3167711 thomas is 14 years old hes done phenomenally and for me to be a part of a partnership with him is a great thing i knew that we were capable of a medal but i also knew that it depended on how tom performed i wasnt on the top of my game but i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens he was very nervous more so than ever before i think he really struggled to get through the competition and as his partner it was hard for me to get up there and try and ease him into it unfortunately for me it didnt work today
3167712 hes a great kid hes like a little brother to me
3167713 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there we just had a bad day i tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and i was very nervous
3167714 it was there for the taking but it wasnt my day today now im looking at 2012 like ive always said
3167715 and i hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead unfortunately i dont have another chance
3167716 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3167717 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3167718 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3167719 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3167720 the size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3167721 having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3167722 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3167723 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3167724 the tackle was high and over the ball and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3167725 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit
3167726 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football
3167727 the most remarkable student i have had the pleasure to teach
3167728 im always a proponent of giving team mvp awards to everyday players but its hard to argue about guthrie the guy is among the league leaders in quality starts and has been the only constant on the staff

3167742 drawing him again i knew god was testing me this time i brought my performance with me i could have boxed better but there were my tactics to beat him round by round
3167743 hes been my bogeyman my goal here was to bring my fight to him and as the fight went on i got more and more confident hes a big banger but i let him chase me that was the plan
3167744 i said to johnny yesterday that if this guy beats you again hes going to bring you home and put you on the mantelpiece
3167745 i know now as the tournament goes on the better ill get especially after beating him the way i did

3167784 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3167785 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3167786 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3167787 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3167788 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3167789 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3167790 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3167791 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3167792 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3167793 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped which 25 did they think i was responsible for
3167794 its so appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3167795 cica makes decisions on conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them in each individual case and any applicants unhappy with the decision in their claim can ask for a review by a more senior member of staff
3167796 an inquiry into how the investigation was handled was carried out by the mets directorate of professional standards following receipt of a complaint from the victim in 2005 this resulted in one officer a police constable receiving a written warning and another a detective constable who has transferred to another force receiving words of advice officers apologised to the victim concerned
3167797 she wasnt back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me and i love it
3167798 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous
3167799 im very grateful actually personally that i had a chance to get out and see so much of america because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in february and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign and chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother in the last three months alone i went to 350 different communities i got to see parts of america i never saw when i was running or serving and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
3167800 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change
3167801 i think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing
3167802 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
3167803 secondly because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand feeding the people that are there educating them providing basic healthcare having some near term economic strategy i think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them
3167804 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
3167805 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath
3167806 im not a government and i dont have access to vast amounts of money and im frustrated that even when the democrats are in we still havent given a tax credit for example for wind energy that goes more than three years
3167807 i just try to figure it out and i try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this because i was so struck by all these countries that wont meet their kyoto targets
3167808 one reason i went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow ill go home now and ill be able to tell people that i went to the highlands of ethiopia and saw a classroom with two led lights nobody will believe that and that it works economically for them
3167809 i just want very much the country to change course
3167810 i want us to be on a different economic course a different social policy course a different course in the world and were going to do what we can to be helpful
3167811 look what we were doing was working so you had to assume there was going to be some blow back
3167812 and im immensely proud of her but i think shes the political leader of our family now im not in politics and im going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision i think shes been big and positive and thats what we should all be
3167813 when they have more money they dont know what to do with it in rema
3167814 they are happy they dont need a mercedes or a television when they have money the men are always going to the bar the solar cinema is to show them what money can do how opportunity can come to their lives they have three meals a day but they dont know what is going on in the world
3167815 ranges from neon sheer washes in turquoise magenta and yellow to geometric prints in diagonal mazes and stripes
3167816 does highlight a trend with other studies linking shortages of vitamin d to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly
3167817 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3167818 id hate to see such a beautiful woman make such a costly mistake
3167819 some of its resulting confusions are indelicate and therefore may merely be hinted at many moral hotel clerks are troubled at the assignment of rooms to the traveling lucy stoners and their husbands
3167820 puberty tends to begin slightly later than the average for girls as the
3167821 enshrinement of feminine beauty and energy continues males ritually bathe and sanctify their female partners washing them with holy water scenting and combing their hair perfuming them and arranging them on a silken bed males then perform a programmed ritual in which they touch the womans forehead eyes nostrils mouth arms and thighs finally touching the vagina itself
3167822 dont you wish you could have that right now dont you wish you didnt look like you were single
3167823 why dont they sell guns and ammo magazine at the airport
3167824 we prepared before strike we knew we think maybe everybody strike so we prepared before to be ready
3167825 we did for the future of my kids and for my life
3167826 there was a lot of shrapnel flying in the air there was pieces of propane tanks coming down out of the sky
3167827 thats what we were running away from when we first left the house
3167828 there was a lot of stuff flying out of the sky on fire
3167829 i think time of day saved us and thats how much worse it could be no one was out of their houses no one was sitting on their front lawns
3167830 the numbers of casualties we could have had would be tremendous
3167831 you try to save those you care about and your most important possessions
3167832 the problem with asbestos is when its disturbed and becomes airborne it becomes dangerous to people
3167833 we are unable to allow people in the vicinity of the 100 or so remaining homes until the ministry of the environment approves our plan for cleanup
3167834 ive got our kids at my house ive got a dog with no food
3167835 im disappointed with the government that they would allow anything like a propane company to be situated where it is in the middle of a heavy residential area

3167842 ladies and gentlemen for the black watch i have great regard and the duty i have to perform gives me great content and that is to ask the noble marquis to unveil this monument
3167843 this monument i declare is very elegantly made and its bold style is quite in keeping with the country i find and the committee were fortunate in obtaining so able a designer as mr rhind
3167844 sir i have been requested by the committee to give you the deed conveying the monument to your care with the feu charter of the ground therefore sir id have you beware
3167845 my noble lord i accept the charge and you neednt be afraid really it gives me much pleasure in accepting as i now do from thee this memorial along with the deeds on behalf of aberfeldy
3167846 the toast i have now to propose is long life and prosperity to the royal highlanders in spite of their foes
3167847 we are talking about this because we want everyone to know what a brilliant job david and cameron did in saving dylan
3167848 dylan and cameron thought they would take a short cut while riding their motorcross bikes but dylan did not see a barbed wire fence
3167849 he rode his bike straight into it and the barbed wire caught him in the throat
3167850 it tore his throat open splitting one side of his neck to the other side
3167851 all the nerves and muscles in his jugular vein were severed
3167852 our boy died three times on the ground there and david revived him three times
3167853 he owes his life to his friend and his father and we cannot thank them enough
3167854 mum i really want to eat pancakes and syrup he told her
3167855 do you know what it meant to me to hear those words
3167856 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
3167857 it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper so cry away
3167858 that gave us latitude to be able to look at some serious candidates
3167859 our no 1 concern is to encourage people to come in
3167860 we have to conduct our study for the health and well being of our community
3167861 obama himself a poster child for the efficacy of school choice has a unique chance to invigorate the public private debate in education instead he panders to teacher unions
3167862 former democrat was elected in 2006 as an independent his move to back mccain comes as the senator ramps up efforts to appeal to independent voters
3167863 the oscar winner has been sharing his views on policy
3167864 he offered himself during a town hall meeting campaign stop as the candidate of reform bipartisan work and independence when needed
3167865 the democratic national committees new campaign ran into some inconvenient news this week
3167866 this might seem to complicate obamas continual use of exxon mobil on the stump
3167867 jasno vidljivi iz bilo kojeg dela atine savr eno uravnote eni i blje tavo beli stubovi hrama partenon ponosno se uzdi u naspram plavog neba u pozadini kao besmrtni simbol ljudskog duha i genijalnosti
3167868 my wife and i arrived in paterson more than 30 years ago after losing everything in the cyclone tracy disaster
3167869 basically before we left darwin we had nothing left just a few bits and pieces so i took a job here and we fell in love with the place
3167870 i was interested in agriculture and the environment in local history so its a combination of all my interests
3167871 its a culmination of all my studies over 30 years and its something i have always wanted to do
3167872 before i started working on the thesis i read some interesting environmental histories of scotland and gippsland and i thought someone should do something on the hunter valley
3167873 part of the challenge is making sure there are enough long term places for people to go
3167874 women will stay in abusive situations because they dont want their children to be homeless
3167875 weve got to have more and better crisis services weve got to have more and better permanent places to help women and children
3167876 well do the usual letter boxing and meet and greets but as far as my campaign goes this is probably our best tool
3167877 it was the department of defence that decided the winning tenders and the howard governments national security committee signed off on defences recommendation
3167878 in terms of whats on the ground now theres a whole lot of new infrastructure to go in
3167879 government road will be upgraded and there will be new intersections constructed to access new roads
3167880 were planning on new a neighbourhood park a new community centre and local parks
3167881 of course the upgrade to thornton rail bridge has to be in place before much of this development can go ahead
3167882 much needed opportunity for politicians to learn the nuts and bolts of small business
3167883 its important that politicans should see first hand how small businesses operate from serving customers through to legislative requirements
3167884 the state governments role is to ease the burden on small business where it possibly can
3167885 that is in reducing monetary based burdens such as pay roll tax but the major thing is in removing red tape
3167886 the government has set up the state regulatory office within the small business ministry that looks at that very issue
3167887 we have already worked through the motor and food industries
3167888 china produces lots of co2 regulating china is hard we shouldnt try qed
3167889 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
3167890 automakers made some big changes in their production plans based on what happened during the second quarter clearly gasoline prices will continue to climb in the long term but our data calls into question whether consumers current preferences will continue in the long term
3167891 and there came out from the camp of the philistines a champion named goliath of gath whose height was 6 cubits and a span about 9 ft
3167892 and the philistine said i defy the ranks of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard these words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid
3167893 all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were much afraid
3167894 who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
3167895 look at you who do you think you are making a stand you just think youre better than me and want everyone to follow your beliefes

3167899 the public and the current and future public servants within epa owe afge council 238 a big thank you for a job well done
3167900 this agreement means that epa will not be able to put a computer terminal and a bookshelf in a cubicle and call it a library
3167901 these libraries should never have been closed nor should it have taken months of bargaining to get epa to agree to put them back in order
3167902 the architects of these library closures cannot leave public service soon enough
3167903 oh good ill have that many less things in my room

3167907 employees of it enabled service companies are at the highest risk of suffering from lifestyle diseases they are constantly under stress work against the clock and defy nature at every step only few companies have really addressed this problem

3167909 unhealthy workers are 20 less productive than their healthy colleagues and twice as prone to sickness with figures like this employee health definitely needs to be looked at very seriously

3167912 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
3167913 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

3167920 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3167921 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3167922 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3167923 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities

3167926 uh you know what they need a line divider so people cant get in your space
3167927 everything is there on a plate and its easy to take it for granted
3167928 its pretty hard for young players when youre surrounded by a comfortable environment
3167929 you might not push yourself as much as you should but ive learned from it and im a better player now
3167930 i was at newcastle from u 14 level and left when i was 20
3167931 i wouldnt say i thought it was a cakewalk but i just thought that i had made it and my chance would come
3167932 i hope as soon as possible anthony basso will find another club
3167933 i am not involved in which club he will go to but i wish him all the best and i hope he can get back playing football again
3167934 this is between the player the club and his agent
3167935 steve at the moment is number one jamie macdonald is number two and i have given them the responsibility
3167936 i am not happy and i want to change the goalkeeper situation very quickly i want to have a goalkeeper or a goalkeeper coach
3167937 we wouldnt rule anything out but we havent heard anything from hearts nor have we approached them
3167938 we managed to get back into it twice but to lose a goal at the end was really disappointing
3167939 however we will take the positives from the game as i thought we were good for long spells of the match
3167940 we will be playing the same way as we did last season but at the end of the day we need to take a draw if we have to
3167941 we also need to win games but at the same time play good football
3167942 im sure that the results will come and im not too disheartened by our performance
3167943 nine times out of ten the player wont hit it like that and it was a great finish for their third goal and you can only really applaud that
3167944 maybe there was a lack of concentration and a few individual mistakes over the park but these things happen
3167945 at the end of the day it was a defeat and we need to start picking up points starting on saturday
3167946 well look forward to the aberdeen game and play some good football again but this time hope to get the three points
3167947 with the way we played last season every team will want to put one over us and the aberdeen game will be the same
3167948 i know the player of course but there is no link to us

3167954 c lebrity is really a comment on the current concept of fame success and all that goes with it

3168030 it makes the job of the correctional officer more efficient
3168031 the evidence is that they work unreliably that the technology is not proven and that there are dropout zones where the technology fails
3168032 its the electronic quick fix but so far there have not been a sufficient number of analyses to determine what benefits fall out from this technology
3168033 this type of gimmickry takes away from proven reliable human interventions that are actually evidence based
3168034 offenders are being held more accountable than ever to their court orders
3168035 this committee as envisioned was to provide parliamentary and independent advice to the prime minister
3168036 if its cabinet people on it the suspicion has to be that theyre not there providing independent advice theyre just there as mouthpieces for the prime ministers office
3168037 we have to respect the separation between judicial power and the government

3168048 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3168049 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
3168050 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire

3168066 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3168067 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3168068 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3168069 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3168070 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3168071 moscovo comprometeu se moralmente a defender os ossetas sem ter por detr s uma estrat gia para resolver o conflito

3168075 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3168076 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3168077 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3168085 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3168086 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3168087 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3168088 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3168089 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3168090 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3168091 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3168092 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3168093 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3168094 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3168095 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3168096 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3168097 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3168098 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3168099 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3168100 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3168101 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3168102 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3168103 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3168104 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3168105 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3168106 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3168107 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3168108 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3168109 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3168110 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3168111 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3168112 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3168113 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3168115 of those fatal accidents where alcohol is implicated it has been on very rare occasions and i have been doing this job for 17 years that i have come across inquests where people have been killed with a blood alcohol level of between 50 and 80mgs normally the blood alcohol level involved in these deaths is between 150 and 350 mgs
3168116 as many as 42 of female motorists admitted getting behind the
3168117 respondents were asked within the past 12 months have you drunk alcohol before driving and if so how much 2 406 male and 2109 female drivers were questioned 41 of male drivers said they had not drunk alcohol before driving compared to 58 of female drivers 17 of male drivers said they have driven after a maximum of one small glass of wine or equivalent compared to 28 of female drivers 25 of male drivers said they have driven after a maximum of two small glasses of wine or equivalent compared to 11 of female drivers 8 of male drivers said they have driven after a maximum of three small glasses of wine or equivalent compared to 2 of female drivers 9 of male drivers said they have driven after four or more small glasses of wine or equivalent compared to 1 of female drivers
3168118 the most successful campaign would be one that had a clear message that no amount of alcohol is acceptable any amount affects your reaction times and judgment for such a campaign to work the government needs to reduce the drink drive limit which is currently crazily high this is a battle for a lower limit and a simpler communication message no alcohol is the only possible safe amount when driving
3168119 the uk limit is higher than a number of other eu countries with poland sweden and norway setting their limit at 20mpg

3168158 it really is a superior device to what else is out there
3168159 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3168160 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3168161 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3168162 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped which 25 did they think i was responsible for
3168163 its so appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3168164 cica makes decisions on conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them in each individual case and any applicants unhappy with the decision in their claim can ask for a review by a more senior member of staff
3168165 an inquiry into how the investigation was handled was carried out by the mets directorate of professional standards following receipt of a complaint from the victim in 2005 this resulted in one officer a police constable receiving a written warning and another a detective constable who has transferred to another force receiving words of advice officers apologised to the victim concerned
3168166 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was something frenzied
3168167 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime
3168168 people are very subdued at the moment they are in mourning
3168169 it can be rebecca adlingtons baths or beckys whatever she wants were really proud of her and the way our leisure facilities here have given her a hand
3168170 just wait even betters to come shes going to win the 800 metres as well i know it for certain its her best length and i remember the determination she showed when she came to these baths at the age of five
3168171 well stick to the deal we made with her now that if she won gold id cook her a roast beef dinner with yorkshire pudding im going to give her a huge chocolate cake too in the shape of a christian louboutin shoe thats her other great love
3168172 i rang home and all i heard were screams down the phone
3168173 i could hardly breathe out when i turned on the radio to get the result shes done wonderfully she trains down the road in nottingham now but shes always been good to mansfield she knows that it all started here
3168174 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3168175 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3168176 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3168177 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3168178 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3168179 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3168180 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3168181 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3168182 i just want to take it one start at a time for now and finish the year strong
3168183 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3168184 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama

3168208 trainers feel the mandatory requirement suggests a widespread problem with misuse of inside information by trainers and bha has admitted that this isnt so
3168209 we have always been willing to discuss the options but bhas decision to issue an ultimatum to trainers without establishing support from the ntf was unnecessarily provocative we remain open to resolving the situation sensibly
3168210 all licensed jockeys have now attended a seminar and the professional jockeys association has been totally supportive from the outset
3168211 in respect of trainers it was considered they have a vital educating role for their staff therefore they are required to understand the key messages themselves and need to be able to fully communicate this to their staff
3168212 we are convinced that this is the correct approach to ensure that all participants in the industry are aware of their responsibilities in respect of handling information and the role everyone has to play in maintaining the integrity of the sport
3168213 i go back many years with jon and in my opinion he is a man who will compliment our existing coaching team
3168214 this is a ground breaking appointment and a vital position within the coaching team i feel jons skill and knowledge will be invaluable in creating the required structures and environment to assist myself in maximising the development of our players at every level of the club
3168215 i am looking forward to joining one of the biggest clubs in rugby league and returning to a club where i have a lot of friends and very fond memories from my days as a player
3168216 my role at hull will be very varied but it will allow me an opportunity to work with all the coaching staff and some of the best players in super league
3168217 it was not far away from the perfect start and from the way i want to play cricket in the future
3168218 if we play like this we will beat australia this is a starting stage the key is to turn up to every single test like we have this week
3168219 i have definitely done a bit of thinking about australia for sure
3168220 you want to get the structure right so guys can play in a certain position for a long amount of time so that they can feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3168221 i am very happy with fred batting at six i am very happy with that attacking option to play australia next year i want flintoff batting six in my team
3168222 steve harmison is hugely important to the australia series i said to steve i want you to open the bowling to bowl fast to bowl straight to be the old steve harmison and as an extra responsibility to get some runs at nine he said he would do his best his best has been good enough this week
3168223 the confidence that we have gained and the lessons we have learned are important factors in going to australia
3168224 we didnt bowl nearly as well as we expected on this tour it was heartening to know that we still had this huge potential to improve but were still winning
3168225 its an amazing asset to have someone on board with that access
3168226 theres an awful lot of football in the media but much of its fairly straight stuff from press conferences what ive found is that if you get footballers onto subjects other than who theyre playing next theyre happy to talk about them
3168227 phil went to have tea with harry redknapp and caught him very relaxed it produced a lively jocular piece theres a lot of stuff written about footballers as footballers but this will be about footballers as people
3168228 were adding to and stimulating a market thats been dominated by one player for too long
3168229 in our 14 years a lot of football magazines have come and gone but were still standing everyone thinks they can make a great football magazine but as history shows not many do
3168230 this video has been removed due to terms of use violation
3168231 ive been through a lot other people only see me out there running and theyre jeering and criticising and saying a whole bunch of stuff but they dont know the real person or what im going through
3168232 i saw my mum running all over the place crying and i was trying to find out what had happened and she was just saying michaels dead michaels dead it was very disturbing
3168233 i was on my way to the national trials when i heard and i didnt know how to react because id never lost a brother there were just tears falling from my eyes
3168234 i told myself i wasnt going i put down my bag and took off my clothes my brother donovan was in texas and he phoned and told me to go out there and do it because thats what michael would have wanted he got me back out there but i was in tears i was torn apart i still made the team and i got to run the 100m at the commonwealth games but i wasnt focused on the race i was in front but i just stopped running and finished fourth it was very tough
3168235 i then lost my brother vaughan the next year he was in america playing football and he collapsed on the field and died there are times now when i sit in my room and remember them and i just start crying its not something you really get over
3168236 i can just imagine how my brothers would be if they were still here now they would probably be outside the door jumping and saying thats my brother thats my brother they were crazy crazy excited about their brother running
3168237 beaten a hundred times i just lost the one that counted
3168238 i was too confident i never lost a race for three years and so i just thought i have to go out and run a world record that was wrong because i lost focus when i saw tyson running alongside me i couldnt believe it because id been way ahead i was shocked and i didnt correct anything it was then too late
3168239 i definitely would have gone under 9 7 but i slowed down because it was a heat i was disappointed in a way because if i had run like that two weeks before i would have been world champion
3168240 its hard for me to be an underdog when i can run 9 7 i can break the world record and stuff like that but when usain goes out on the track hes the one people are expecting to win
3168241 who wouldnt be that was only the fourth 100m of his career so i was very surprised i was saying what is he going to run in the next one i sent him an sms but i had changed my number so he wasnt sure who it was so when he called he said who is this but when he heard it was me he was almost apologising for breaking the world record i said congratulations man keep up the good work that love between them is amazing
3168242 every day we have been together he called me the fast man and i called him sarge in jamaica we just mess around with names we have been friends a long time and nothing changes us maybe if he was from the us it might be different and there would be anger in our hearts but he looks up to me and so it feels good that ive always been helping him and hes such a nice person i still call him sarge and he still calls me fast man
3168243 im always confident i can run faster than the rest
3168244 there is always rivalry between the us and jamaica most people in the world have this thing about the united states everywhere i go people always say make sure you beat the us so were not friends and its not like im going to try to be friends just because were both running fast
3168245 if everybody approached the sport the way i do it would be clean it would draw a lot more people because they would say thats a normal human being running but im tired of it every day people ask drugs this drugs that its very annoying
3168246 you want to make them afraid you want them to think that if i do drugs ill go to jail but i cant do anything about it i can just say some harsh stuff
3168247 i can really only speak for myself i have no idea what anyone else is doing there are people out there who do drugs sometimes i see them go across the finish line and theyre making a cross and praying to god im saying why are they praying when theyre cheating why are they thanking god but some athletes dont have a heart they dont care but it gives me an extra boost when i run against guys i think are on drugs and i beat them
3168248 there has been pain and strife but this is my big chance and thats why it is a lot better that usain and tyson are racing against me if they didnt run in the 100m people would say if usain and tyson had been there i would never have got gold but now when i beat them in front of everyone they will see that i deserve to be the fastest man in the world
3168249 the way our current players inter change is definitely different to the united teams ive played for in the past
3168250 the front of three or four seem able to play in every position across the front line and its difficult for opponents and defenders of the other teams to know who theyre going to be playing against from minute to minute let alone match to match in that sense this is probably the most inventive side ive played in
3168251 it is not just the way they attack that makes them so special
3168252 carlos tevez nani giggsy and wayne rooney for that matter are also fantastic defenders in their own right they tackle well and are all willing to win the ball back
3168253 im really excited about the coming season and am looking to all the fantastic challenge ahead of me
3168254 this is an important year for me having been out for so long and i want to thrive on the fact that ive obviously not got a great deal of time left in my career im coming to 34 years of age so its important i play as often as possible and enjoy doing it while i can
3168255 if someone happens to beat padraig im sure it would give us a boost
3168256 not because of what he has done but because of how close he is to how good he can be
3168257 because padraig has such an active mind one that tends to think about too many things at once we have focused on getting him to smile no matter what
3168258 smiling and a quiet mind tend to go together as do being serious and thinking too much
3168259 you must strive for perfection youll never reach it but you must strive for it
3168260 throughout my career ive always applied myself i look for what will help my game and when i find it i work to improve it but its always taken some time many times in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3168261 im looking at this period as one of those where i am coming out stronger i have more experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course and applying myself i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3168262 he can hit a ball over 300 yards with one hand on the club
3168263 and he can do it with either hand he can hit it about 310 yards with his right hand and he can get within five yards of that with his left
3168264 thats longer than he can do with both hands on the club and you should see him when he takes a run at the ball from maybe 10 yards away he takes a hop skip and a jump and just belts it he can also hit a pitch shot from a divot mark make the ball fly straight up and catch it in his pocket
3168265 he is progressing really well but we will check tomorrow after training
3168266 there are lots of players with big egos and some of them might not want to put their neck on the line
3168267 we have found it a little bit difficult to bring in the quality that we want its highlighted one or two weaknesses we have as a football club but we are growing we are looking to push on and improve on what weve achieved there is money available but its finding the right ones
3168268 the way our current players inter change is definitely different to the united teams ive played for in the past
3168269 the front of three or four seem able to play in every position across the front line and its difficult for opponents and defenders of the other teams to know who theyre going to be playing against from minute to minute let alone match to match in that sense this is probably the most inventive side ive played in
3168270 it is not just the way they attack that makes them so special
3168271 carlos tevez nani giggsy and wayne rooney for that matter are also fantastic defenders in their own right they tackle well and are all willing to win the ball back
3168272 im really excited about the coming season and am looking to all the fantastic challenge ahead of me
3168273 this is an important year for me having been out for so long and i want to thrive on the fact that ive obviously not got a great deal of time left in my career im coming to 34 years of age so its important i play as often as possible and enjoy doing it while i can
3168274 we were four hours in drug testing as she was called for a random blood test as well it all got a bit manic because the press wanted plenty of time with her too
3168275 shes now on a recovery programme which should give her a real crack at both races
3168276 today shes going out to a quiet pool away from all the attention and well just try to train rest and recover with plenty of good food sleep and massage hopefully shell then come back fighting in a couple of days
3168277 when she got out i told her i just want to say becky adlington olympic champion because i wanted to be the first person she heard it from what a fantastic day
3168278 shes always had a prodigious technical talent focus and discipline
3168279 she is a very strong willed young woman those traits set you up in this game
3168280 she now does about 70km a week usually from 10 two hour sessions twice a day
3168281 theres a lot of speed work and hard endurance work off very short rest periods its a punishing routine but she does very well on it
3168282 it was a bit surreal because our plan for the race just didnt materialise
3168283 i thought whats going on here it was very cat and mouse and rebecca along with jo jackson who finished in third place were both clever to wait before coming through with those storming finishes
3168284 im not a betting man but shes obviously shes got a chance
3168285 but there are some big players in that race and this is a new experience for her if she doesnt swim her sunday best in the 800m heats she could end up watching the final from the stands
3168286 even though jeremy clarkson slagged them off as chavvy i dont care
3168287 were having a great olympics for the last two nights every single swimmer got through into the finals or the semis
3168288 its unbelievable rebeccas performances have had a knock on effect and all the swimmers are firing the camp is a great place to be right now
3168289 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3168290 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3168291 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3168292 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3168293 i am a huge admirer of vedran he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at city
3168294 it is a real boost for everyone at the club
3168295 since i have been in football there has been a basic question
3168296 are you pretty or are you efficient its as if you have got to choose
3168297 they were a bit disappointed because of the name of arsenal
3168298 i think they would have wanted a team in eastern europe or something
3168299 i know twente quite well as i have dutch satellite tv at home
3168300 they had a great year last year and although theyve lost engelaar and el ahmadi who were the playmakers they got one good player back from vitesse arnhem janssen so they are still in good shape with a good team
3168301 the people in holland are really happy with mcclaren and they are almost proud to have him because it is quite a strange move to come from england manager to twente
3168302 holland is very proud especially twente and they are all saying that they really like his style of coaching
3168303 i remember that but normally we had a tough time against his sides
3168304 we are ready for this game we have our pre season games under our belts and were ready
3168305 its an amazing asset to have someone on board with that access
3168306 theres an awful lot of football in the media but much of its fairly straight stuff from press conferences what ive found is that if you get footballers onto subjects other than who theyre playing next theyre happy to talk about them
3168307 phil went to have tea with harry redknapp and caught him very relaxed it produced a lively jocular piece theres a lot of stuff written about footballers as footballers but this will be about footballers as people
3168308 were adding to and stimulating a market thats been dominated by one player for too long
3168309 in our 14 years a lot of football magazines have come and gone but were still standing everyone thinks they can make a great football magazine but as history shows not many do
3168310 theyre a good team who are strong on the counter attack theyve got good quality in midfield and in their forwards but i think we are ready to win against croatia we have a very good team its not important who our opponents are its just important what we do we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3168311 its important that the players who i put in the squad for the czech game have been getting games in pre season because its impossible to be fit if you havent been playing in the friendlies
3168312 i will trim my squad down on saturday after the first part of the first day of the premier league but the most important games involving manchester united and chelsea are on sunday and that will be dangerous
3168313 once the season starts my players will need to be playing for their clubs theyll need official games thats very important
3168314 the size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3168315 having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3168316 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3168317 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3168318 the tackle was high and over the ball and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3168319 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit
3168320 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football
3168321 the most remarkable student i have had the pleasure to teach
3168322 but i want to stay here at chelsea and fight for my place in the team
3168323 its a very expensive option but again it would be an option if we were allowed to speak to the lad if that happened then who knows
3168324 i find myself in a situation where someone higher than me asks for access to a system and they feel that their request is beyond question this person may be the project manager for a project or someone above me in the food chain but invariably they are always shocked and appalled that i asked why they need the root admin password to the system and then thats when the chain of meetings start to discuss why am i being difficult not a team player etc
3168325 i may not be universally approachable but ive always politely and respectfully asked my questions to get an understanding of what they were looking for
3168326 and then and then im gonna send you on a hunting trip with cheney if you keep saying and then you little heathen
3168327 the chef is a virtuoso while the scientist analyses the changes undergone by foods in cooking
3168328 in the past 10 years we have created more dishes than world cuisine in the past century the dialogue between science and cuisine opens new doors
3168329 often fundamentalists come to break up parties and set off bombs or fight with the military or the family to make instability
3168330 since the war everyone has been afraid and theyve reduced the weddings so its only at home its not so big and its without music because the fundamentalists and military dont allow it
3168331 some people only go to get the bride from her fathers home and take her away without any celebration
3168332 i was not in a high position it was normal within the university
3168333 but with the us invasion they were starting to kill many baathists and were making troubles for me so i decided to leave
3168334 the internet helps many young couples connect with each other and make a family
3168335 it was of course my dream to get married in baghdad but the particular situation was too difficult to arrange a marriage there and for me to go to iraq
3168336 i would like to get married to a woman who has education so i can have a discussion with her
3168337 the norwegians have given me peace and stability and this is what i hope to give to hind so that she does not sit at home and feel lonely
3168338 i love her and she loves me and everything will be ok this is most important but also she should learn the language so we can introduce her to the culture and the people and she will feel at home
3168339 now when the sun sets we should be at home before 2003 we could go to the theatre make excursions now its impossible its all closed
3168340 we live in a shia area so its not so bad as the mixed areas which is where they have the most problems but i still cant go with my friends on the streets
3168341 i think it will be not such a big problem because they have a few iraqi families there
3168342 my dream is to make a happy family and i will give 100 to fulfil that vision
3168343 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river
3168344 and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
3168345 many parents have found this to be a fun activity as well as giving them a unique artistic keepsake of their pregnancy
3168346 almost two thirds of the wage gap is because of reasons unexplained and one third is for reasons explained
3168347 this could be a result of women working in less skilled manufacturing positions or could be evidence of discrimination in that sector
3168348 do bugger all according to specialist sports doctor catherine spencer smith
3168349 we need to get them active so their generation doesnt die before us
3168350 building up as much bone mineral density as possible is vital
3168351 hopping running skipping jumping off things and rapid twisting are all important
3168352 if a child is old enough and sensible enough to follow instructions say from the age of 11 a programme of light weights and high repetitions is a good idea
3168353 it is safe provided they are supervised the technique is good and crucially that they are not lifting weights that are too heavy a good rule to follow is that if they cannot easily do 10 repetitions the weights are too heavy
3168354 im lucky ive never had any real injuries perhaps because my limbs are in alignment during activities thanks to proper instruction from an early age
3168355 it is also good to do some posture work such as pilates yoga alexander technique or balancing exercises on a fitball or swiss ball
3168356 anything involving balance is good and it doesnt have to be a formal organised activity dance is great at this age you may well be a desk slave so it is particularly important to develop good postural habits it is also a good idea to become accustomed to doing some kind of regular exercise for example cycling or jogging to destress
3168357 if you are overweight or sedentary you may well experience fertility issues exercise can help with hormone regulation and increase the possibility of conception
3168358 thereafter a whole series of things is going on its like having a car when there are a few miles on the clock things start to break down our resting heart rate increases and our muscle mass and strength decrease
3168359 increasing our youthfulness and vitality and improving our skin tone so it is important to do short intense bursts of activity at this age rather than thinking that fitness is all about building endurance whatever cardiovascular activity you do be it indoor rowing running swimming or triathlon make sure you also do strength training you can lose loads of weight doing endurance work but weight training develops the whole body
3168360 we can prevent decline in physical function later in life by pinpointing and dealing with problems now
3168361 compound moves such as squats deadlifts and bench presses done with medium to heavy weights are the key
3168362 free weights are better than machines as they improve functional strength and work the core and again proper instruction is important youre looking at four sets of each exercise of about six to 10 repeats so youre targeting your fast twitch muscle fibres muscle fibres used for intense sprint type movements as opposed to slow twitch fibres used for endurance exercise the more muscle mass you have the higher your metabolic rate and the more fat you burn when youre resting if you are new to weight training though start slowly you have to precondition your body
3168363 while we cant turn back the tide we can slow the rate of decrease a classic cause of disability in elderly people is falling because of loss of balance before we reach that stage if we can reduce the slowing down of the nervous system we can reduce the likelihood of falling when were older
3168364 try doing it with your eyes closed all the muscles twitch and at first you might panic then you start to improve
3168365 low impact exercise is best it is all about protecting the knees and hips
3168366 without wishing to sound depressing were not talking about building strength but decreasing the decline
3168367 its not about throwing the towel in its about being realistic
3168368 anything that can promote the idea of standing up balancing stretching and breathing bringing in all that coordination has got to be good
3168369 you can play them with a limited level of mobility get a really good cardiovascular workout and socialise
3168370 the balance and stability that the poles provide help to reduce the risk of falling regardless of the environment so it can mean the difference between going out and exercising and doing nothing at all
3168371 as you get older its more important than ever to get the right gear
3168372 as we age our thermoregulation isnt so good so it may be an idea to wear more layers of sports clothing when you exercise
3168373 and the more supple you are the better if your balance isnt great to start with do static stretching and if you can manage something more dynamic go for gentle yoga or pilates
3168374 she just completed a 78 5 mile road race i dont think
3168375 just 2 of articles and 1 of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and womens sports just 1 4 of sports photography featured women and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports pages there were more images of models footballers girlfriends the french presidents wife and a nun than of sportswomen
3168376 there were 367 links from the front page to articles but just five links went to female sports 1 there was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites out of 129 images both photos and film there were four images of women 3 sky sports did have a film of two female sports presenters a third image was of former big brother contestant kate lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot and a fourth image was of an advert for womens health
3168377 team ethos an interest in what the british team is doing as a whole there isnt a separation between male and female events
3168378 when you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court theres definitely an attitude that theyre looking for the feminine shot those moments when they can zoom in on a womans legs for example and then in all the tennis coverage theres the massive interest in fashion even the people who are interviewing the women post match will say how are you going to dress for tonights event which is a long way off the point
3168379 whats great with the olympics is the immediacy of it all you see the women competing and then theyre on the rostrum straight away looking incredibly natural and thats so great to see when it comes to tennis coverage there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now a lot of the promotion around wimbledon this year concerned parties for instance rather than just that specific focus on the sports field
3168380 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist
3168381 as long as it takes to get the job done
3168382 next time you go to dillards watch the employees closely they are all unhappy
3168383 si hambre tuviese la carne del conquistador israeli segun el
3168384 well why dont i just go and tell the police and see what they say
3168385 its only after youve lost everything that youre free to do anything
3168386 hold on and keep loving gina thats all you can do right now for yourself and others
3168387 well your old hometowns so far away but inside your head theres a record thats playing a song called

3168391 this donation will go a long way towards helping improve the winter air in libby
3168392 its a start in a bigger effort and we are excited to be a partner in this important project
3168393 the wood stove industry is committed to making a difference in communities throughout the u s when it comes to reducing excessive wood smoke
3168394 wood is an economical and renewable home heating fuel but it needs to be used in an environmentally responsible way old dirty burning uncertified wood stoves generate an unacceptable amount of smoke for the heat they deliver todays new appliances are not only cleaner burning but they also use less fuel

3168405 ellos sabr n por qu hicieron uso de mi opci n con un cheque sin fondo y por qu despu s cuando tuvieron otra oportunidad no la aprovecharon
3168406 voy a tratar de recuperarme y hacer lo mejor para este club
3168407 los dirigentes sabr n por qu hicieron uso de mi opci n con un cheque sin fondo y por qu despu s cuando tuvieron otra oportunidad no la aprovecharon
3168408 es que me confundi un poquito en las fechas y sera para julio
3168409 no debo cambiarlas porque no estoy aprendiendo realmente nada y solo estoy perdiendo dinero y tiempo
3168410 hay que aceptar que uno tiene limitantes y si no logras algo es porque no tuve la capacidad de hacerlo
3168411 no lo logre porque mis capacidades no me dieron para mas
3168412 yo primero necesito sentir el coqueteo y esto lleva un par de dias yo no soy de las que a la primera se besan con un chico
3168413 this gives brokers a jump on the attackers and raises the bar
3168414 investors need to be extra careful when they are investing in this kind of company because they can lose all of their money and these stocks are particularly vulnerable to manipulation more than ever because of the internet
3168415 decrease the time between the attack being launched and the brokerage being able to respond
3168416 what this self learning behavioural engine does is look at the different attributes of the event not necessarily about the computer or where you are logging on from but about the actual transaction the trade the amount of the trade
3168417 for example have you liquidated all of your assets in stock that you own in order to buy one penny stock
3168418 another example is when a customer who normally trades tech stock on nasdaq all of a sudden trades a penny stock that has to do with health care and is placing a trade four times more than normal
3168419 the fraudster may buy that one stock in multiple small chunks to stay under the radar but we can pick that up and send an alert on that
3168420 more subtly it will detect and question if say five people at the same brokerage are trading this one penny stock in a short period of time and that stock has shown a spike in volatility
3168421 people are somewhat shy on reporting losses because it erodes investor confidence
3168422 pump and dump increases the cost of doing business in terms of the loss in the marketplace
3168423 verisign has taken a proven concept in counter fraud control activity from what they have been successful in doing in the online banking environment and that is to gauge the risk of a specific account activity on the fly and score the risk when they see something that departs from the norm
3168424 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3168425 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3168426 its pretty clear cut of all the large whales humpbacks are maybe the best at responding to the availability of food and breeding habitat so as long as you leave them alone they have a strong capacity to bounce back
3168427 but we must not forget that even if numbers have improved they are still miles away from what they used to be before whaling started commercial hunting should definitely not be allowed
3168428 will not be used to reverse the humpbacks recovery but if there was a concrete proposal for very precautionary sustainable whaling on the table then we have to talk about it
3168429 it is frightening how quickly and quietly some dolphins and porpoises are disappearing
3168430 there is no blood and gore and no whaling ships they are just quietly dying entangled in fishing nets
3168431 when you enjoy doing what youre doing which i do very much i have something to get up for
3168432 charles has this great almost magical gift of melody an unending well of it
3168433 what he does seems very easy and most people think it is to write these simple melodies that stick in your head and never go away
3168434 charles works like a fiend he gets up in the morning and he goes to the piano and he works almost to the exclusion of everything else its the love of his life his work he adores barbara his wife and the kids but hes really obsessed with working
3168435 i started playing piano accompaniment for a lot of singers suddenly i was in nightclubs strip joints i used to play on 52nd street i always had a feeling for jazz even when i was writing more serious works
3168436 i would write a song and i would orchestrate it and copy the parts
3168437 and rehearsal was the next day at 9 so at 4 in the morning i am crossing the lake with the parts still wet i just loved it i never was happier
3168438 we never stopped giving auditions and people never gave money at all the idea of using rock n roll everybody was so turned off
3168439 his agents would not let him sign the contract until he approved every word and note that lee and i wrote
3168440 which meant that we had to at great expense to the producer follow sammy all over the world we spent three years of our lives a week or so each month out in las vegas playing songs for him
3168441 what i love about the score is that it is just good old fashioned tunes
3168442 they are hummable they are great to listen to and really evokes the era of the 1920s
3168443 he is like most really great composers quick to tear something up if somebody says it doesnt work
3168444 he will do it 40 times on one song which is sort of what you have to do but you would be amazed at how many people dont
3168445 if only i had realized i could do that at the time
3168446 gee there might be harmful externalities if i do this so i better not do it
3168447 hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today
3168448 nowhere am i so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans
3168449 when you look at the statistics 30 of all searches are for people
3168450 its a huge category to be sure but one where we know the traffic will be
3168451 very similar to how google started we feel that search is ultimately about people which is where our strength lies
3168452 one thing we found is people may have a hard time figuring out what to type in a search bar so were helping them by suggesting a location or organization and get them started
3168453 its just a random sampling that changes every once in awhile its not done by popularity but its a way for our algorithm to stay relevant given the challenges of people searches with pictures
3168454 the winds of emotions blowing through the investigation and now this courtroom
3168455 chandler grafner was killed by that man sitting right there in a green shirt
3168456 he knew as well as everyone in this courtroom that if you dont feed a child hell die we dont have to prove to you why
3168457 the motive is spelled out in bruises in school in january to the morgue in may
3168458 science is what tells us what happened not these emotions and whims
3168459 science tells us that the body consumes itself when it cant get to sugar
3168460 not a single piece of chandlers clothing had feces or urine on it not a single spot of feces was found on chandler not under his fingernails or his toenails
3168461 why didnt the prosecution show us any of chandlers clothing
3168462 the evidence doesnt fit none of the experts ever identified the fingerprints in the closet nor did they tell us they were of a child or an adult
3168463 chandlers fingernails were equal reasonably well kept is this someone stashed in a closet scratching to get out not a single fingernail was broken not a single toenail was broken and no fingernails were ever found in the closet
3168464 if chandler had been screaming week after week after week why didnt they present any of the neighbors these arent soundproof apartments
3168465 if your goal is to rid yourself of a child this is one of the hardest ways to do it
3168466 this case is a far cry from first degree murder this is someone who missed the signs of diabetes
3168467 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3168468 the credit squeeze has decidedly moved from the mortgage market to the broader credit market
3168469 in our view the reduction of credit availability for consumers will contribute to a sharp decline in spending in the second half of the year
3168470 considerable fractions of respondents reported having increased minimum required credit scores on both types of consumer loans and reduce the extent to which such loans were granted to customers who did not meet their banks credit scoring thresholds
3168471 the big news contained in this report was the soaring number of institutions reporting tighter lending standards for consumer loans
3168472 very large majorities of domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favourable or more uncertain economic outlook their banks reduced tolerance for risk and the worsening of industry specific problems as reasons for tightening their lending standards and terms on c amp i loans over the past three months
3168473 the underlying thesis that gives a bid to the dollar is that we more than anyone around the planet from a central bank perspective responded far more aggressively the sense is we are ahead of the curve and when there is a recovery the us will lead
3168474 back when it began falling i said oil was headed to us200 via us80 and i stand by that
3168475 a creative medium that he still considers to be the most important artistic influence in his life
3168476 by tom twyker if you have not seen it already ja liked that one the most in the metaphorical context of his work he said that the structure reminded him some of his early pantoums and centos
3168477 a film titled after jas poem you might know this one

3168480 i was able to make 75 my first day i can stay home with my girls and still make money this is just what i was looking for

3168485 you better watch out shes a nympho shell try and swoop in and steal your husband if you let her i can tell because thats what my sisters are like
3168486 let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing
3168487 and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole
3168488 service is at the heart of eternal life and our personal destinies the basic test in this life is what we choose to
3168489 for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do
3168490 therefore what manner of men ought ye to be verily i say unto you even as i am
3168491 wherefore there must be faith and if there must be faith there must also be hope and if there must be hope there must also be charity
3168492 i am a man i am only a man i cannot do every thing but i can do one thing and by the grace of god i shall do that one thing
3168493 charity is not just works or gift giving but a condition of the soul a quality of our character
3168494 they conclude that they are not needed because of the erroneous belief that all members of the church should look talk and be alike the lord did not people the earth with a vibrant orchestra of personalities only to value the piccolos of the world every instrument is precious and adds to the complex beauty of the symphony all of heavenly fathers children are different in some degree yet each has his own beautiful sound that adds depth and richness to the whole
3168495 whose hands hang down and who carry a heavy burden
3168496 on the morrow come i into the world to show the world that i will fulfil all that which i have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets
3168497 he came down and stood in the midst of them
3168498 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
3168499 what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it
3168500 strange is our situation here upon the earth each of us comes for a short visit not knowing why yet sometimes seeming to a divine purpose from the standpoint of daily life however there is one thing we do know that we are here for the sake of others for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy
3168501 though i am free from all men yet have i made myself servant of all
3168502 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
3168503 at this wonderful season of hope and renewal we testify of the glorious reality of the atonement and resurrection of the lord jesus christ
3168504 he is not here for he is risen as he said
3168505 christmas is less a day of victory than easter for the story that begins then is incomplete until it is crowned by the announcement
3168506 if the savior having breathed his last on the cross had never come back to the world in life as he promised then the star of bethlehem might as well never have flamed the angels as well never have sung glory to god in the highest in the midnight sky and the wise men from the east need not have taken their journey to find the babe in the manger we might have wept over our crucified king if he had never risen from the dead but we sound his praises now because he lives and reigns forever and ever
3168507 for whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which i have spoken and the magnifying their calling are sanctified by the spirit unto the renewing of their bodies
3168508 center point of hope in the gospel of jesus christ
3168509 as he is the conqueror of death so also is he the master of life his way is the answer to the troubles of the world in which we live
3168510 father forgive them for they know not what they do
3168511 i kept my hopes in check but this time the slope fell away and i found myself standing on a gloomy hump of wind scoured snow i dont remember if i felt any joy in that moment if i did it vanished as soon as i glanced around the horizon was crowded in every direction with snow covered mountains each as steep and forbidding as the one id just climbed i understood immediately that the fairchilds copilot had been badly mistaken we were nowhere near the western limits of the andes our plane had fallen somewhere in the middle of the range in that moment all my dreams assumptions and expectations evaporated into the thin andean air i had always thought life was the natural thing and death was simply the end of living now in this lifeless place i saw with terrible clarity that death was the constant and life was only a short fragile dream i felt a sharp and sudden longing for my mother and sister and for my father whom i was sure i would never see again but despite the hopelessness of my situation the memory of him filled me with joy it staggered me the mountains could not crush my ability to love in that moment i discovered a simple astounding secret death has an opposite but it is not mere living my fears lifted and i knew that i would not let death control me i would walk through that godforsaken country with love and hope in my heart i would walk until id walked all the life out of me and when i fell i would die that much closer to home

3168531 when hoboes ride into town on the train we go to the jungle then we spread out and look for chores to do for food maybe i sweep out a store and the storekeeper gives me a couple of onions i bring them back to the jungle and put them together with everyone elses food to make a hobo stew see onions alone arent so great but add em to a pot of stew and theres more food for all and it tastes better too

3168535 for a skinny guy youve got a pretty good arm

3168607 a conclusive cause of death will have to await further tests
3168608 the crime scene was very unpleasant one of the worst i have seen during a long career sadly
3168609 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack
3168610 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3168611 we have no known motive for this savage and brutal attack
3168612 this is a tragic loss of two young lives and our thoughts are with their families as they try to come to terms with what has happened
3168613 it is understandable after whats happened that theres a great deal of concern in the community and were addressing that with local officers carrying out extra patrols in the area and will be speaking to residents individually to reassure them all is being done to find the offenders

3168629 she just completed a 78 5 mile road race i dont think
3168630 just 2 of articles and 1 of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and womens sports just 1 4 of sports photography featured women and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports pages there were more images of models footballers girlfriends the french presidents wife and a nun than of sportswomen
3168631 there were 367 links from the front page to articles but just five links went to female sports 1 there was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites out of 129 images both photos and film there were four images of women 3 sky sports did have a film of two female sports presenters a third image was of former big brother contestant kate lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot and a fourth image was of an advert for womens health
3168632 team ethos an interest in what the british team is doing as a whole there isnt a separation between male and female events
3168633 when you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court theres definitely an attitude that theyre looking for the feminine shot those moments when they can zoom in on a womans legs for example and then in all the tennis coverage theres the massive interest in fashion even the people who are interviewing the women post match will say how are you going to dress for tonights event which is a long way off the point
3168634 whats great with the olympics is the immediacy of it all you see the women competing and then theyre on the rostrum straight away looking incredibly natural and thats so great to see when it comes to tennis coverage there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now a lot of the promotion around wimbledon this year concerned parties for instance rather than just that specific focus on the sports field
3168635 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist
3168636 its an amazing asset to have someone on board with that access
3168637 theres an awful lot of football in the media but much of its fairly straight stuff from press conferences what ive found is that if you get footballers onto subjects other than who theyre playing next theyre happy to talk about them
3168638 phil went to have tea with harry redknapp and caught him very relaxed it produced a lively jocular piece theres a lot of stuff written about footballers as footballers but this will be about footballers as people
3168639 were adding to and stimulating a market thats been dominated by one player for too long
3168640 in our 14 years a lot of football magazines have come and gone but were still standing everyone thinks they can make a great football magazine but as history shows not many do
3168641 muchas felicidades sigan siendo as de cari osos con los animales y tan respetuosos con ellos
3168642 if only one parent is a u s citizen at the time of ones birth that parent must have resided in the united states for a minimum of 10 years five of which must be after the age of 16
3168643 obama later confessed that he never searched for the government documents on the marriage although madelyn obamas maternal grandmother insisted they were legally married
3168644 this gives brokers a jump on the attackers and raises the bar
3168645 investors need to be extra careful when they are investing in this kind of company because they can lose all of their money and these stocks are particularly vulnerable to manipulation more than ever because of the internet
3168646 decrease the time between the attack being launched and the brokerage being able to respond
3168647 what this self learning behavioural engine does is look at the different attributes of the event not necessarily about the computer or where you are logging on from but about the actual transaction the trade the amount of the trade
3168648 for example have you liquidated all of your assets in stock that you own in order to buy one penny stock
3168649 another example is when a customer who normally trades tech stock on nasdaq all of a sudden trades a penny stock that has to do with health care and is placing a trade four times more than normal
3168650 the fraudster may buy that one stock in multiple small chunks to stay under the radar but we can pick that up and send an alert on that
3168651 more subtly it will detect and question if say five people at the same brokerage are trading this one penny stock in a short period of time and that stock has shown a spike in volatility
3168652 people are somewhat shy on reporting losses because it erodes investor confidence
3168653 pump and dump increases the cost of doing business in terms of the loss in the marketplace
3168654 verisign has taken a proven concept in counter fraud control activity from what they have been successful in doing in the online banking environment and that is to gauge the risk of a specific account activity on the fly and score the risk when they see something that departs from the norm
3168655 despite overwhelming evidence of rab and police responsibility for unlawful killings the interim bangladeshi government seems unwilling to address the problem
3168656 instead bangladeshs security forces continue to get away with murder
3168657 the officials responsible for killing moshiul alam sentu and others should be prosecuted and punished to the full extent of the law
3168658 unless those officers involved are held to account regardless of rank the rab will continue to torture and murder
3168659 the rule of law cant become a reality in bangladesh unless the very forces tasked with upholding the law are also bound by it
3168660 these historical events in c19th china are woven into mingzhis life he is not just as a witness he is part of it
3168661 i found out the timeline of historical events which was very useful i actually merged every important period in mingzhi s life with important events in chinese history when i realised that emperor guangxu was enthroned in 1875 i arranged for mingzhi to be born in that year then when mingzhis wife dies together with the child in labour it is on the same day that the 100 days of reform failed when the reformers are toppled by the empress thats why when mingzhi is waiting for the wife to give birth he counts to 100 and just cant get past that number there are many tiny details like this i dont know if everybody will get them
3168662 so he has to think what is home to him here or there there is a conflict
3168663 it will redefine the concept of home in modern society when everything is moving so quickly and people become so busy people can just go from one place to another place so easily and some people even have houses in different places so it explores how we define home and how sometimes home just equals a sense of belonging
3168664 since october 2001 approximately 1 64 million u s troops have been deployed for operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom in afghanistan and iraq early evidence suggests that many returning service members may be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and depression traumatic brain injury is also a major concern but there is limited evidence about the scope of the problem or the most effective treatments rand conducted a comprehensive study of the post deployment health related needs associated with these conditions the health care system in place to meet those needs gaps in the system and the costs associated with these conditions and with providing quality health care to those in need
3168665 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3168666 we will not hesitate if there are a set of circumstances and facts and findings that lead to an outcome of noncompliance to pass that on
3168667 im disgusted and annoyed that its a spanish girl who is the first positive doping test from the games
3168668 just being able to stick with the routine between starts
3168669 being able to run and lift and throw on the side the same things that i would typically do
3168670 its a positive effect for anybody that wants to stay in the rotation
3168671 we were swinging at davids pitches instead of having a better plan
3168672 i thought he threw the ball a lot better than what the numbers show
3168673 he showed flashes of a guy that can pitch over here
3168674 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3168675 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3168676 today was a big win for us a big win
3168677 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3168678 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3168679 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3168680 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3168681 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3168682 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3168683 at night there is no such thing as an ugly woman
3168684 however there has been a shocking lack of consultation with local authorities and disregard for the wishes of local people
3168685 some councillors are quite understandably furious that they have not been adequately consulted on what is happening in their area
3168686 its pure folly to dump this kind of accommodation into the middle of a residential street without properly asking for the councils views
3168687 there is nothing in the available data that indicates that the introduction of variable fees in england has yet had any lasting impact on the level or pattern of demand for full time undergraduate education
3168688 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3168689 we remain unconvinced that asking students to pay more for a university education is the best way to encourage those from poorer backgrounds to apply
3168690 appears so far to have had no discernible impact on the mix of individuals applying to enter full time undergraduate programmes
3168691 unfamiliarity on the part of some eligible students with their entitlement under the new system
3168692 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3168693 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3168694 the consequences for world security human rights and energy security are tremendous and huge
3168695 i said this violence is unacceptable i was very firm with vladimir putin hopefully this will get resolved peacefully
3168696 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3168697 program which has the overall goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2020 lockheed martin corp which is developing the orion spacecraft and united technologies corp company which are working on new rockets
3168698 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
3168699 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
3168700 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3168701 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3168702 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3168703 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
3168704 such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
3168705 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
3168706 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3168707 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3168708 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3168709 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3168710 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3168711 mr fawoles actions were serious and blatant and he poses an immediate risk to lenders
3168712 over the past year the negative impact of equities on scheme assets combined with falling bond yields have led to an overall worsening of the funding position resulting in a 8 6 increase in aggregate liabilities while weaker equities have reduced assets by 7 4
3168713 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3168714 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market activity
3168715 in terms of the outlook the july survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise albeit at a low level
3168716 it has been an encouraging month for sales 25 up on june and just 20 down on july 2007
3168717 conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding
3168718 the only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices ie repossessions new builds on large developments and the older rural properties the first time buyer is on the list of endangered species
3168719 with no let up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes forward orders pointed to further slowdown
3168720 with shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase core basics childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well
3168721 even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy
3168722 northern rock needs to ramp up new lending of low loan to value mortgages because they are not getting enough customers in to compensate for whats going out
3168723 these products represent northern rocks cautious approach to new lending to focus on the quality of customer that the bank is pursuing
3168724 our solid performance reported at the end of the first quarter has continued throughout the first half of the financial year
3168725 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investments portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
3168726 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3168727 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3168728 well you missed the great returns on that fund but we have another one
3168729 the individual defendants have staked their ability to extricate themselves from these frauds on the success of their diamond mining investments in africa
3168730 gt alex tub island farm adventures bath playset turn tub time into a treat with this rubber playmat island
3168731 dont come to our house again because if you do ive got guns
3168732 i have got an air rifle and i have got a pistol and i am going to shoot the fucking vandals who come around here
3168733 go on then shoot me you silly old woman he said he was so near now that i worried he might try to grab the pistol but i knew that if i backed off i would lose face as if to reinforce this he slowly moved his right foot right up against mine toe to toe move your foot i said he didnt i pointed the gun at his foot still he didnt move i obviously wasnt going to shoot him so i moved it to the side of his foot and shot it at the pavement it was as if to say i could have done it but i didnt the gun made a pathetic puff i had his attention now so i fired the gun twice more at the tarmac away from us
3168734 im very sorry for what i did and realise i shouldnt be allowed to do that
3168735 but before i did that my life was totally intolerable because i didnt know what was going to happen next
3168736 im not having anybody bully my kids john said it was like a lioness with her cubs id had enough of them targeting my children
3168737 i dont bear any animosity towards those who targeted the family home now they dont give us grief any more i feel i have had far more damage done to me by the police they could have done something about stopping what was going on they could have helped us more
3168738 i had become ensconced in a world where extreme behaviour was the norm and ceased to be shocked by it
3168739 the pupils were out of control and it felt like a pressure cooker ready to blow
3168740 school was a very stressful place to work and i think i was still grieving for my mum who had recently died but what was driving me to despair was the fear that in some way the attacks on our home were related to my boys and i feared for their safety
3168741 this was the lowest sanction tantamount to a telling off
3168742 i was really pleased i didnt feel vindicated but i did feel i now had some credibility again the panel had risked public criticism to impose the lowest sanction against me and i was grateful
3168743 the utter futile frustration of being incarcerated isolated removed from my life the agony of separation from those i love and the pain of those who love me the boredom the waste of precious time the removal of free will
3168744 it is not the slightest bit involving and is sadly lacking not only in substance but also in basic narrative structure it is hard to make poetry out of confusion
3168745 but he will undoubtedly be massacred by the film critics
3168746 it seemed he got lost in his car somewhere in the centovalli region
3168747 its problems of rhythm and the total absurdity of certain scenes are topped off by the platitude of the infrequent dialogue which ends up making everything insipid
3168748 those for whom his books are all about the sex scenes also risk disappointment the film has only got one the pen suits him much better than the camera
3168749 houellebecq hasnt managed to make a film with the same impact as his writing it is the usual modernist fare
3168750 its pretty clear cut of all the large whales humpbacks are maybe the best at responding to the availability of food and breeding habitat so as long as you leave them alone they have a strong capacity to bounce back
3168751 but we must not forget that even if numbers have improved they are still miles away from what they used to be before whaling started commercial hunting should definitely not be allowed
3168752 will not be used to reverse the humpbacks recovery but if there was a concrete proposal for very precautionary sustainable whaling on the table then we have to talk about it
3168753 it is frightening how quickly and quietly some dolphins and porpoises are disappearing
3168754 there is no blood and gore and no whaling ships they are just quietly dying entangled in fishing nets
3168755 following a weak set of second quarter results we believe bid support may drop away should the sale of bskybs stake be deemed unnecessary by the cat competition appeals tribunal or delayed
3168756 we see the risk profile of the group as rising as the business continues to evolve through acquisition and move away from historic areas of strength
3168757 recent deals consolidate cobhams status as a tier two player but in our view undermine its attractions as a take out candidate
3168758 the potential reward for owning these stocks is a possible re rating to a price tangible book ratio of 1 after taking into account possible write downs
3168759 debenhams flat at 53p woolworths up 0 46p at 7 36p and m amp s were all the rage last week in terms of bid rumours but none of these look particularly attractive to us
3168760 if overseas buyers come looking for cheap uk assets despite the grim outlook for consumer spending then our three favourites would be game wh smith and kesa
3168761 we remain of the view that the financing is renegotiable and that trading issues will begin to nominalise with todays statement providing encouragement on both these fronts we do not feel this is currently reflected in the shares which are currently trading on 4 7 times our cy09 expectation
3168762 the writer never turned up for his press conference he apparently got lost in his car as lost presumably as his film both he and the movie come from another planet
3168763 if you look at the huge cost of setting up an infrastructure to accommodate full scale mining then it is still better to buy than build
3168764 it can all be summed up in one word china our estimate is that the economy will continue to grow at around 15 per cent a year until 2015 it is going to acquire enormous amounts of steel copper and aluminium
3168765 two billion people are entering the industrial age it is like rebuilding europe after the second world war but on an even bigger scale
3168766 the china story is the story of the mining sector no one expected chinas growth to continue at this rate people have said it is the top of the cycle since the growth first started five years ago there is nothing very new in what is happening at the moment the mining industry has always grown by acquisition it is very rare to see a mining company go from buying mineral rights to production life is just too short to rely on your own exploration although some companies have been successful at it but i expect the larger companies to carry on as they are taking out other large companies to gain control of their assets
3168767 last november we said that we would explore the possible sale of some or all of the us coal assets of rio tinto energy america as part of a group wide divestment programme both options are being explored in the interests of maximising shareholder value
3168768 rio tintos announcement is a clever move in our view it would raise capital and highlight the value of this business
3168769 if you put on your bearish hat it could also signal the fact that rio tinto is struggling to sell this division we dont think that this is the case though it is just a question of price we suspect
3168770 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3168771 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3168772 a top editor meaning an ame or higher from a major newspaper has written new hillary 08 campaign manager maggie williams a letter complaining about inflammatory remarks made by clinton spokesman that very note is one of the notes obtained by the atlantics
3168773 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3168774 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3168775 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3168776 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3168777 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3168778 it is a clear violation of georgias sovereignty and recognized borders
3168779 were just out here soliciting support to say no to going back to school the first day
3168780 were part of this campaign to get better schools in chicago
3168781 when they go see their olympic size pools when they go and see air conditioned building current books thats going to expose them and empower them
3168782 im just thinking if yall trying to help us get more books and air conditioning maybe ill stay out for a week or so
3168783 kids need to be in school so they can get an education
3168784 the longer theyre out the more it puts our children behind
3168785 i dont want my daughter to miss any of her education that first week of school they jam a lot into it for the kids
3168786 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river
3168787 and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
3168788 many parents have found this to be a fun activity as well as giving them a unique artistic keepsake of their pregnancy
3168789 she wasnt back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me and i love it
3168790 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous
3168791 im very grateful actually personally that i had a chance to get out and see so much of america because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in february and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign and chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother in the last three months alone i went to 350 different communities i got to see parts of america i never saw when i was running or serving and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
3168792 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change
3168793 i think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing
3168794 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
3168795 secondly because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand feeding the people that are there educating them providing basic healthcare having some near term economic strategy i think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them
3168796 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
3168797 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath
3168798 im not a government and i dont have access to vast amounts of money and im frustrated that even when the democrats are in we still havent given a tax credit for example for wind energy that goes more than three years
3168799 i just try to figure it out and i try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this because i was so struck by all these countries that wont meet their kyoto targets
3168800 one reason i went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow ill go home now and ill be able to tell people that i went to the highlands of ethiopia and saw a classroom with two led lights nobody will believe that and that it works economically for them
3168801 i just want very much the country to change course
3168802 i want us to be on a different economic course a different social policy course a different course in the world and were going to do what we can to be helpful
3168803 look what we were doing was working so you had to assume there was going to be some blow back
3168804 and im immensely proud of her but i think shes the political leader of our family now im not in politics and im going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision i think shes been big and positive and thats what we should all be
3168805 when they have more money they dont know what to do with it in rema
3168806 they are happy they dont need a mercedes or a television when they have money the men are always going to the bar the solar cinema is to show them what money can do how opportunity can come to their lives they have three meals a day but they dont know what is going on in the world
3168807 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that
3168808 i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums the next one will bring it back to the start in a way
3168809 it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought maybe when im 40 and broke i might come back but that all feels a bit pants
3168810 she showed how much of an actress she is today
3168811 i feel like i have been on a rollercoaster ride
3168812 during a random discussion at the april nelug meeting robyn my wife and muse off handedly said
3168813 he told me he wanted to go to the jets he said he wanted to back brett up and that he always liked green like back in his philly days
3168814 it is really a waste of my time to sit here and to have to answer to such ridiculous untrue comments that are made out there in the world today
3168815 yes i do want a chance to be a backup again but wearing green has nothing at all to do with it i just find a way to start as a backup and make it to the pro bowl and win playoff games
3168816 my thing was i didnt say that he liked green like i said the conversation and interview was loose and from my knowledge im not sure if jeff likes green or not
3168817 well i guess thats as close to bretts bucs as were going to see
3168818 i get tired of how hard it is anything is possible if you put your heart in it you put your soul into and believe it can happen

3168831 infolgedessen bin ich sehr erfreut an den vorklinischen forschungsarbeiten dieses innovativen antiviralen wirkstoffkandidaten beteiligt zu sein und freue mich auf die fortsetzung der erfolgreichen zusammenarbeit mit canopus biopharma auf diesem gebiet
3168832 es ist m glich dass eine h here dosierung des statins als in der studie verwendet eine noch gr ssere wirksamkeit zur folge haben wird statc tm scheint auch wirksamer zu sein wenn es vorbeugend verabreicht wird
3168833 wir sind auch vom potenzial dieser verbindung im vergleich zu anderen derzeit verf gbaren grippemitteln sehr angetan es steht ausser frage dass es einen grossen weltweiten bedarf an einer berlegenen kosteng nstigen und reichlich verf gbaren alternative f r den kampf gegen die grippe gibt
3168834 no one is expecting a burger and chips to be super healthy
3168835 however i think a lot of people would be surprised to find out just how unhealthy some fast food options are
3168836 if youre not sure about something just rub it against a piece of paper if the paper turns clear its your window to weight gain
3168837 ja es gibt ein solches angebot die russen bauen eine konkurrenzliga zur nordamerikanischen profi liga nhl

3168841 dem gegen ber steht die marke hertha bsc mit einem wert von derzeit rund 150 millionen euro das ist ein sehr gesundes verh ltnis
3168842 uns gehts darum die mannschaft zu st rken alles andere w re kokolores
3168843 wir w rden auf keinen fall anfangen kurzfristig viel geld f r einen star auszugeben wir wollen die spielr ume langfristig erweitern
3168844 die finanziellen dimensionen von schalke oder bayern k nnen wir aus eigener kraft nicht erreichen
3168845 meine freundin marie erfuhr dass er eine m dchenband gr nden wollte
3168846 es war sehr unaufger umt herr demmler trug eine graue jogginghose war freundlich als ich zu singen anfing sagte er sinngem dass er mein zwerchfell abtasten m sse er fasste mir an meine unterhose
3168847 wir tanzten ihm vor er sagte dass wir unsere kleidung ausziehen sollten er k nne so nicht richtig unser rhythmusgef hl erkennen
3168848 er legte sich auf eine couch wir mussten uns mit den t shirts auf ihn setzen und uns im takt der musik bewegen
3168849 einige tage sp ter war auch meine ltere tochter bei herrn demmler jaqueline damals 16 jahre alt
3168850 herr demmler hat mich gefragt ob ich schon sex habe und was ich von gruppensex halte ob ich mir vorstellen k nne mich f r den playboy auszuziehen er bot mir an dass ich bei ihm auch nackig rumlaufen k nne das sei ganz normal von den f nf stunden die ich bei ihm war sprachen wir viereinhalb ber sex musik spielte kaum eine rolle
3168851 da herr demmler zu den vorw rfen schweigt kam er wegen verdunklungsgefahr in u haft
3168852 b nisch hat den ersten kampf gewonnen jetzt geben wir live zum zweiten guido de santis bitte
3168853 sollte es so gewesen sein muss ich mit dem kollegen dar ber sprechen da es nicht blich ist wir haben gar nicht die m glichkeit alles live zu senden da wir nur einen live kanal haben aber immer mehrere sportarten gleichzeitig laufen
3168854 wir w rden niemals sagen dass wir live senden wenn es nicht wirklich live ist bei einer solchen sportartenvielfalt wie den olympischen spielen ist es nicht m glich immer und berall direkt zu bertragen das muss der zuschauer wissen aber wir weisen auch nicht explizit darauf hin wenn wir mal gerade nicht live drauf sind
3168855 wir zeichnen die sendung in etappen auf wir k nnen unsere g ste doch nicht bis nachts um drei uhr im studio sitzen lassen
3168856 wir em fahrer sind noch lange nicht topfit und das dauert auch noch so zwei drei wochen dennoch tun wir alles daf r um trotzdem erfolgreich zu spielen
3168857 wir sind noch nicht da wo wir sein wollen damit m ssen wir leben und uns nun zu beginn einfach durchwurschteln
3168858 bis man die handschrift von j rgen klinsmann bei uns sieht brauchen wir noch ein bisschen zeit wir m ssen erst mal alles verinnerlichen
3168859 wir wollen dem trainer das leben ein wenig leichter machen m ssen besser spielen und reifen j rgen klinsmann hat es ja eh schon schwer genug
3168860 die schleuserbande verf gte in berlin ber sichere unterk nfte und war straff organisiert
3168861 dabei verschwieg der angeklagte dass er einen pkw im wert von 35 000 euro fuhr und bei seiner festnahme 20 000 euro bargeld besa
3168862 so verr ckt es klingt das tattoo gibt mir neue kraft
3168863 kurz vor seinem tod hat er mir einige zeilen geschrieben
3168864 liebster sohn entschuldige dass papa nicht mehr zeit mit dir verbracht hat seit wir dich zur welt gebracht haben m ge gott immer mit dir sein daddy
3168865 ich bin eigentlich nicht der typ f r t towierungen
3168866 aber diese s tze habe ich 20 jahre in meinem herzen getragen
3168867 es muss auch jemanden geben der volkspolizei m tzen verkauft die jungen leute wollen nachvollziehen wie es damals war
3168868 das treiben der vermeintlichen amerikanischen und russischen soldaten ist eine geschmacklose verh hnung kein mensch kann mehr erkennen wer auf welcher seite stand
3168869 geschichtsf lschung weil leute in russischen oder franz sischen uniformen diesen historischen ort besetzen obwohl er ein us checkpoint war
3168870 wir kriegen massenhaft internationale beschwerden ohne daf r zu l hnen darf niemand den checkpoint fotografieren
3168871 ein unerh rtes spektakel das dem ort und seiner historischen bedeutung nicht angemessen ist
3168872 in den augen der touristen wird dieser rummel dem land berlin angelastet das offenbar nicht in der lage ist n tigung und geschichtsf lschung wirksam entgegenzutreten au erdem gef hrden fotografierende fu g nger den verkehr
3168873 ich habe die darsteller darauf hingewiesen dass jegliche kommerzielle aktivit t zu unterbleiben hat und die w rde des ortes gewahrt bleiben muss
3168874 das ordnungsamt wird das kontrollieren wir sehen zu dass wir die foto soldaten auf ein baugrundst ck verschieben
3168875 die situation wird f r ihn eine andere sein wenn unsere verletzten wieder dabei sind dann m ssen wir schauen wie wir toni immer wieder die m glichkeit geben k nnen dass er an dieser luft schnuppert
3168876 magdeburg berlin wirklichkeit werden bild stellt die positionen von bef rwortern und gegnern vor
3168877 auf vermittlung des dfb ist die versicherungsfrage nun zu unserer zufriedenheit gekl rt wenn diego sich verletzt dann gibt es eine ausfallzahlung
3168878 das will ich nicht ausschlie en wenn es zahlungen f r andere spieler gibt dann erheben wir ebenfalls anspr che es muss eine gleichbehandlung geben
3168879 ich kam ber die nah und landschaftsfotografie an den akt das ist spannender als blumen zu fotografieren
3168880 vor 14 jahren hatten meine damalige tanzpartnerin und ich die idee aktfotos zu machen uns inspirierte ein foto das wir nachmachen wollten wir hatten eine menge spa und daraus habe ich mich weiterentwickelt und entdeckt was mir liegt
3168881 nein ich finde es unheimlich spannend leute mit meiner kamera zu beobachten ich begebe mich mit meinem fotoapparat auf entdeckungstour der jeweiligen k rper
3168882 die m nner zieren sich h ufig anders als die frauen die viel offener f r das spiel mit der kamera sind
3168883 ich bewundere auch die arbeiten von jim rakete der macht klare sachliche fotos unter anderem von musikern toller typ mit dem ich gern mal ein bier trinken w rde
3168884 wenn er 10 meter geht muss er zwei minuten pause machen
3168885 leider nicht bei den frauen bin ich nicht so schnell ich suche noch immer die richtige
3168886 ebenfalls so um die 12 sekunden ich gebe immer vollgas
3168887 ja wenn ich mir etwas in den kopf setze ziehe ich das so rasch wie m glich durch
3168888 schon als kleiner junge war borussia mein gro er traum seit ich f nf jahre bin wollte ich eines tages f r den bvb spielen jetzt hab ich es geschafft
3168889 bei bayerns hallenmeisterschaft zog ich mir einen kreuzbandriss im rechten knie zu damals spielte ich f r thannhausen in der landesliga bekam von der krankenkasse nur die op kosten erstattet die reha hab ich ganz allein geschafft und finanziert in nur knapp sieben monaten
3168890 liefs pl tzlich wie geschmiert nach meinem comeback habe ich in nur 1100 spielminuten zehn tore f r thannhausen erzielt sogar in der bayernliga weil die tsg zwischenzeitlich aufgestiegen war
3168891 erstmals im meinem leben allein sonst war immer die familie meine eltern und f nf geschwister dabei diesmal sa ich im hotel vorm computer und habe mit ihnen geschrieben
3168892 nein meine familie kennt mich ganz genau und wusste dass das foul keine absicht war ihr zuspruch hat mir gut getan
3168893 klar sieht das komisch aus wenn die b lle meilenweit bers tor gehen aber mario hat genug selbstvertrauen so etwas wegzustecken
3168894 insgesamt bin ich mit meiner leistung in peking zufrieden ich kann doch nichts daf r dass die weltspitze so weit weg ist
3168895 ich war so schlecht weil mein freund am vortag schlecht geschwommen war darum konnte ich berhaupt nicht schlafen
3168896 dass ich so schlecht bin h tte ich nicht gedacht
3168897 ich gebe zu ich sehe ein bisschen schwarz eigentlich sollte man bei olympia zumindest bestzeit schwimmen aber davon sind wir weit entfernt
3168898 eigentlich bin ich eine coole sau aber heute habe ich zum ersten mal den druck gef hlt wenn man als olympiasieger auf die matte geht
3168899 wir lassen uns nicht nerv s machen abgerechnet wird am schluss
3168900 ich habe die szene nicht gesehen und nicht beurteilt sie deshalb auch nicht im spielbericht vermerkt
3168901 wir haben vom dfb einen anh rungsbogen in der sache bekommen
3168902 das war normaler bewegungsablauf ich wollte mich nur losreissen der gegenspieler hatte mich an der schulter gehalten der hat sich schon davor mehrfach fallengelassen es gab nach der szene doch auch keine diskussionen selbst die gegner haben nicht protestiert
3168903 ich will der mannschaft helfen m glichst treffen wir brauchen ein 1 0 oder 2 0
3168904 wir haben sofort ein endspiel das die gesamte saison entscheiden kann wir m ssen atletico packen
3168905 der erste film von comedian genie mario barth 35 in die kinos
3168906 zwei m nner und eine frau und das ist das problem
3168907 wenn einer von uns gro en erfolg hat dann drehen wir einen film zusammen
3168908 langeweile erzeugt kreativit t immer nur pool ist doch doof der film ist wie ein blick durch ein schl sselloch in unser leben wie alles anfing ein fan wird sich den film 10 mal angucken weil er immer noch berraschende details findet
3168909 die dreharbeiten sind so komisch dass marios bruder matthias extra eine zweite
3168910 jetzt mache ich als koregisseur von m nnersache erst mal schnitt ton etc dann gibts am 26 september die dvd ber die olympia show sensationelle aufnahmen dann gehe ich wieder auf tournee dann eine woche urlaub und dann endlich unser kinofilm vermutlich fr hjahr 2009
3168911 ja das war der sch nste tag meines lebens wenn ich jetzt das leere stadion sehe kommt alles zur ck die show die feier die fans die wehmut
3168912 todd was a loving and enthusiastic messenger of love and support not only in business but with his family in athletics and in his faith
3168913 they feel sometimes a sense of helplessness people so they want to do something
3168914 hopefully the online does not substitute the human contact that families desperately need after a death
3168915 wir haben ber die rolle geredet quentin ist fest entschlossen sie mit einem deutschen zu besetzen deshalb wollte er sich auch nicht mehr mit leo dicaprio treffen mehr darf ich noch nicht verraten
3168916 in der h he braucht man mehr leistung um das gleiche zu erreichen man kann also viel leistung bolzen ohne den bewegungsapparat mehr zu belasten
3168917 mit hat sich den respekt aller in der mannschaft und im verein erarbeitet und mondragon ist ein absoluter f hrungsspieler
3168918 ich werde die mannschaft so f hren dass wir erfolg und stabilit t bekommen
3168919 wir haben alle von nun an eine wichtige aufgabe hier zu erf llen vom pr sidenten bis zum zeugwart gilt die bundesliga ist eine ganz andere kategorie das m ssen wir gemeinsam professionell angehen
3168920 would that be powerful enough to blow up an armored mercedes
3168921 he said that he had meant only his own car that he wanted to know if it would resist
3168922 the states of eurasia are acquiring a real independence and are becoming a reliable link in the new world order
3168923 russia is not the status quo power that the united states and the europeans have wanted to believe that it had somehow become
3168924 the people of georgia have spoken with a loud and clear voice they see their future in europe georgia is an ancient european nation tied to europe by culture civilization and values in january three in four georgians voted in a referendum to support membership in nato these aims are not negotiable now we are paying the price for our democratic ambitions
3168925 since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody any more thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
3168926 the current national testing system is not set in stone there may well be changes
3168927 aberdeenshire man drowned at sea he was a butcher in union street
3168928 were ulstermen and weve paid for this holiday and were going to enjoy it
3168929 we have been told we should make our way overland through the mountains to armenia which i think would be a great adventure
3168930 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy the conservative party believes the police should be given both the resources to do their job and the freedom to use them revising the acts framework so that authorisation and all the paperwork that goes with it is not required for basic police work is just one way the party will cut red tape to free more police onto our streets
3168931 this isnt about being soft or tough this is just common sense
3168932 i knew it was him did my heart not burn within me
3168933 where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth tell me if you have understanding who determined its measurements surely you know
3168934 have you comprehended the expanse of the earth where is the way to the dwelling of light and where is the place of darkness that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home
3168935 job you wouldnt even know how to save yourself if you tried because without me you dont know light from dark
3168936 am i allowing myself to be spiritually malnourished by relying on predigested god
3168937 their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ in whom are hid all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge
3168938 oh yeah were back in pool and could receive a call any minute
3168939 i will not sacrifice that which has cost me nothing
3168940 we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors we borrow it from our children
3168941 fell short of the categorical retraction of the imputation of anti semitism that i insisted upon
3168942 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived
3168943 i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise and of course its so nice to get some good news the story really is unbelievable it was a beautifully written letter the intriguing thing is that someone had gone to such trouble to do this for a complete stranger
3168944 it seems as though common sense has prevailed a mail service is something you expect in the 21st century and we felt that we were being cut off from the wider world
3168945 you need to have the food so that the audience can experience the mayhem and people are loving the fact that they feel part of the 13th episode
3168946 he was a very good guy very friendly and everyone liked him i feel sorry for him it is so sad
3168947 74 of cosmetologists report lower spending on services and over 60 report a reduction in tips from a year ago
3168948 i think sometime in august i hope to come to a conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3168949 i know there was talk about first of august but i never said i said sometime in august hopefully ill be able to make a decision i wont make that until i really feel comfortable with making a good decision
3168950 im just trying to bring my mind to a point where i can make a good decision whether or not im going to play hockey right now thats my first decision and well go from there after that
3168951 i work out all the time so im not worried about the conditioning part
3168952 we found the file but cant delete it because its in use
3168953 ben collett and his family are happy that this case has finally come to a close and that ben is now able to move on to the next chapter in his life
3168954 the size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3168955 they all had that extra thing that drove them to be the best he had the desire to be a top player he didnt lack technical ability or stamina it is difficult to say where he was going but i had absolutely no doubts about his commitment he was an a class player magnificent i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3168956 football didnt work out and im now devoting myself to literature
3168957 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
3168958 it is a tough area but convenient for the university
3168959 as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people we are far away from home and we live in a strange area i want to know why this happened
3168960 sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
3168961 this is a nice place to live and we have been here for 15 years but seeing all the police activity has brought back memories of wesley
3168962 rice refuses to interrupt her holidays to deal with georgian conflict
3168963 they were nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3168964 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack we will work around the clock to catch those responsible
3168965 existing policy setting was exerting the appropriate degree of restraint
3168966 any relevant and proportionate information held by the local police forces
3168967 there has to be a way to identify and weed out unsuitable people but such checks do not mean an end to commonsense instead they give employers the tools to make the best employment decisions
3168968 virtually any adult who wished to come into contact with any children
3168969 i am likely to usher my wife forward if a child falls over in the street lest my picking up the child could be misinterpreted adults particularly men should not routinely be seen as potential child abusers
3168970 i do not deny the importance of this but it is perceived to be a real obstacle for adults working with children
3168971 saya bingung kalau ditanya soal aset atau kekayaan yang sudah saya miliki berputar sih jadi susah menghitungnya
3168972 jangan dilihat sekarang naomi itu hidup enak mau ngapaian aja bisa tapi lihat prosesnya
3168973 jika saya sudah sampai seperti saat ini tentu saya bersyukur tapi ingat ini bukan sesuatu yang tiba tiba
3168974 kerja keras mama membimbing kami menyekolahkan anak anaknya membuat saya tahu apa itu arti perjuangan
3168975 pertama kali mulai mencoba memutar uang pribadi saya justru menghadapi hal yang tidak mengenakkan
3168976 saat itu saya mulai berpikir nggak mau lagi bisnis pakai uang sendiri kalau nggak berhasil bisa hancur lebur
3168977 saat itu lamaran saya sempat ditolak tapi kemudian dipanggil lagi
3168978 dengan membagi bagikan ilmu seperti itu aku tidak takut mendapat pesaing baru justru kemampuan kita akan banyak terasah
3168979 tipe kuda jinak akan melindungi perusahaan sementara kuda liar untuk marketing perusahaan
3168980 saya nggak punya waktu liburan yang terencana kalau mau liburan ya langsung libur
3168981 nggak ada saya bukan orang yang senang lihat gunung senang lihat pantai pokoknya pengin ke mana gitu saya langsung ngajak keluarga berangkat
3168982 enak rasanya bareng satu keluarga berlibur biasanya kita carter pesawat
3168983 kalau naik mobil itu saya seperti berada di rumah sendiri pokoknya mobil itu lebih dari sekadar teman
3168984 saya sebenarnya ditawari mengerjakan banyak proyek bisnis tapi saya nggak mau aji mumpung harus ada yang ngerem saat kita digoda banyak obsesi
3168985 cobaan kan ada dua saat susah dan senang nah aku sekarang diberi cobaan dengan sesuatu yang enak aku harus ingat aku juga harus mengutamakan orang orang yang kusayangi
3168986 saya ingin menjual kegagalan maksudnya jangan takut gagal justru dari kegagalan itulah kita harus belajar untuk menuju kesuksesan
3168987 as hist rias dos meus livros s o desde h muito dadas por manchas como uma pintura
3168988 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step in resolving this conflict
3168989 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3168990 at the distance scale of the nuclear radius it is fair to consider antiprotons as destructive particles
3168991 the probability of finding itself within such a small distance from the nucleus is several orders of magnitude smaller than the probability of being deflected
3168992 people dont realize such obvious things until you actually encounter some phenomena and think very hard about them
3168993 people here have quite a lot of money and i dont think the economic situation is externally affecting them
3168994 they may just have to choose a little more wisely but theyre still doing all the things they were doing before its more the working class folks who are having a hard time
3168995 there has been no problem we are full here every night
3168996 i came here a little bit after the oil started it has been up and down since then but it is busier than ever now if there are any people in the world who are happy at the moment its people who produce oil this is the european capital of the oil industry companies like shell bp and total they all have money to spend
3168997 i cant say we are feeling the credit crunch personally
3168998 ask me again in a few months the answer could be different
3168999 weve had a phenomenal response to the store since opening reflecting the demand for luxury fashion products in the city
3169000 the bar is part of the healthy oil market thats where my customers disposable income comes from
3169001 the oil market here is quite a significant part of this but we are well placed with two universities as well so people are still piling in to the buy to let sector
3169002 they only come up every now and again there are still buyers out there and people are prepared to wait there is a shortage of housing in scotland so even if it does slow down it wont be for long people always need somewhere to stay
3169003 the past few years have been very good business for aberdeen it is not as bad here as it is in the rest of scotland we havent noticed any difference once we get them through the door they are still willing to spend the same amount of money
3169004 dear lord please let there be another oil boom we promise not to piss it away this time
3169005 historically aberdeen has always had a buoyant economy in the 16th century we had two universities here when the whole of the rest of england only had two it was and still is a knowledge based economy
3169006 we are just keeping on doing what we have been doing for the past 500 years
3169007 people are talking about it everyone is aware of it i suppose but here in aberdeen you are surrounded by people who work in the oil industry so its not really feeling the pain yet
3169008 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him

3169024 hits zijn geweldig maar niches vormen de nieuwe grote markt
3169025 toen andersons artikel in wired verscheen kwamen er studenten op me af om te vragen of ik het stuk had gelezen rond diezelfde tijd gaf anderson ook een presentatie op harvard zijn theorie sloeg enorm aan de muziek en filmindustrie liepen ermee weg je kwam de long tail tegen in business modellen ik vond het een interessant idee maar twijfelde wel meteen of andersons verwachtingen klopten
3169026 andersons theorie druist in tegen alle bestaande literatuur je kunt wel een enorm media aanbod hebben maar dat betekent allerminst dat mensen hun vraag automatisch aanpassen fragmentatie van de media leidt niet per se tot een fragmentatie van het publiek in andersons boek staat ook weinig bewijs voor zijn claims dat kun je hem misschien niet kwalijk nemen hij heeft een business boek geschreven hij is geen wetenschapper
3169027 dat klopt bovendien blijkt uit een vergelijking van de verkoopcijfers uit verschillende jaren dat hits in de loop der jaren ook niet minder belangrijk worden een kleine selectie hits voorziet nog altijd in een groot deel van de vraag de staart van het productaanbod wordt wel langer maar de verdeling van verkopen over die producten wordt steeds dunner mensen zijn nauwelijks ge nteresseerd in al die nieuwe niche producten
3169028 in zijn boek kijkt anderson vooral naar de aanbodzijde niet zozeer naar de vraagkant hij heeft natuurlijk gelijk als hij zegt dat het aanbod groter wordt de tail wordt langer maar wat betekent dat voor een mediaproducent of voor een winkel wat moeten die anders doen moeten producenten hun aandacht verdelen over een grotere groep producten en moeten winkels een groter assortiment aanbieden mijn conclusie is dat er voor de producent vrijwel niets verandert en dat winkeliers erg voorzichtig moeten zijn met het uitbreiden van hun aanbod
3169029 stel dat een producent honderd miljoen euro heeft te besteden anderson suggereert dat die producent zijn geld in de toekomst meer en meer in een groot aantal kleine projecten moet stoppen telkens n miljoen in honderd projecten bijvoorbeeld in plaats van 100 miljoen in n project zoals nu vaak gebeurt immers anderson beweert dan onze vraag zal verschuiven naar die niche producten en dat als je de opbrengsten van die projecten bij elkaar optelt ze veel waard zijn de realiteit is echter dat de kans steeds groter wordt dat producenten vrijwel niets verdienen met een niche productstrategie de competitie in de tail wordt steeds intensiever en de meeste producten genereren bijna geen verkopen om een voorbeeld te geven bijna de helft van alle dvds op de markt in de verenigde staten verkocht in 2004 niet meer dan 300 exemplaren en een kwart niet meer dan 50 exemplaren dan zie je hoe lastig het kan zijn de productie en distributiekosten terug te verdienen laat staan winst te maken
3169030 voor de retailer kan er wel wat veranderen omdat de transactiekosten voor het aanbieden van een product via internet veel lager liggen dan in een gewone winkel kun je ook zaken aanbieden die je in een normale winkel niet kunt vinden maar ook hier liggen de zaken wat gecompliceerder en wordt het er zeker niet makkelijker op winkels moeten zich realiseren dat ze met de meeste niche producten weinig kunnen verdienen en hun activiteiten zo organiseren dat ze geen of vrijwel geen kosten hebben aan het aanbieden van de long tail een slimme online boekwinkel maakt bijvoorbeeld niet zelf de pagina met informatie over een boek waarvan hoogstwaarschijnlijk maar n of twee exemplaren worden verkocht maar laat de auteur of uitgever dat zelf doen ook is het verstandig om zon boek niet op voorraad te hebben liggen in een distributiecentrum maar het on demand te printen als iemand het wil kopen
3169031 het grappige is dat ik dat zelf ook opmerk in mijn artikel die 10 000 nummers vormen 1 procent van het totaalaanbod bij rhapsody de 10 procent meest beluisterde nummers bij rhapsody zijn goed voor 78 procent van de plays ik ben de eerste om te zeggen dat alleen kijken naar relatieve cijfers allesbehalve zaligmakend is alleen kijken naar absolute aantallen heeft ook zo zijn nadelen trouwens het gaat om de combinatie
3169032 andersons mening lijkt in de loop van de tijd te verschuiven aanvankelijk leek hij de staart te defini ren als alle producten die alleen via internet verkrijgbaar zijn de long tail begint dan dus waar het aanbod van de fysieke retailer ophoudt maar nu zegt hij dat je naar de grootste retailer moet kijken walmart dat is een bijzonder onhandige definitie walmart is een warenhuis en geen specifieke media retailer en als hun assortiment bepaalt wat de head is kan n manager bij walmart een enorme ruk aan de tail geven bovendien heeft het weinig te maken met de kracht van het internet de muziekwinkel op de hoek van de straat had altijd al een veel groter aanbod dan walmart
3169033 ja heel veel sommige mensen geloven niets van mijn onderzoek en vinden me een complete idioot wat ook wel eens verfrissend is om te horen maar gelukkig heb ik veel berichten gekregen van managers uit de mediawereld die de patronen herkennen die ik beschrijf en die aangeven blij te zijn dat het bestaande beeld is rechtgezet businessweek de wall street journal en andere publicaties hebben lovend over mijn onderzoek geschreven en veel blogs hebben er aandacht aan besteed verscheidende grote uitgevers hebben me ook benaderd met de vraag of ik een boek wil schrijven
3169034 toch wel een beetje het onderzoek dat ten grondslag ligt aan mijn onlangs verschenen artikel in harvard business review was al ruim een jaar in het publieke domein de papers stonden al op mijn website ik dacht dat de meeste insiders wel wisten wat mijn resultaten aangaven dat bleek dus niet zo te zijn

3169043 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy

3169075 whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
3169076 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
3169077 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist america
3169078 i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement
3169079 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
3169080 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies
3169081 there is not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
3169082 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
3169083 its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance
3169084 reading voights op ed piece these many years later i realise how right he was
3169085 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds

3169093 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3169094 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3169095 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3169096 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3169097 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3169098 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3169101 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3169102 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3169103 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

3169105 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3169113 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3169114 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3169202 they all had that extra thing that drove them to be the best he had the desire to be a top player he didnt lack technical ability or stamina it is difficult to say where he was going but i had absolutely no doubts about his commitment he was an a class player magnificent i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3169203 football didnt work out and im now devoting myself to literature
3169204 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived
3169205 i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise and of course its so nice to get some good news the story really is unbelievable it was a beautifully written letter the intriguing thing is that someone had gone to such trouble to do this for a complete stranger
3169206 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3169207 at first glance some water companies such as dwr cymru welsh water wessex water severn trent water and yorkshire water seem to have taken this to heart and said that they can continue to meet their obligations to deliver a safe reliable service provide further benefits to consumers and do this without raising prices much above the rate of inflation if at all
3169208 other water companies such as southern water sutton and east surrey bristol water south east water folkestone and dover and cambridge water have proposed bill increases of over 20 per cent above the rate of inflation
3169209 the consumer council for water believes that many customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of other household bill increases customers will want to see the justification for any proposed price increases to understand exactly what they will get for the extra money
3169210 to our mind the efforts undertaken by this defendant to avoid conclusive identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value wark said

3169212 what it means is that were asking anybody who knew him or was associated with him between 1985 and 1988 to come forward

3169230 the interruption of the strong growth trends we have experienced over the past several years was disappointing but we remain extremely confident about our future growth
3169231 we are continuing to focus on our long term goal of achieving annual sales of 500 million by the year 2011 and we are making good progress in executing the primary elements of our strategy in addition we are seeing tangible results from our ongoing operational improvement programs as evidenced by the increase in the gross margin of our carbon fibers business unit to 33 3 in the recent quarter from 29 6 in the second quarter of this year even though acn our primary raw material and energy costs increased to historic highs
3169232 we are working closely with every one of the major wind turbine manufacturers to address their concerns about incorporating carbon fibers in their design and while we cannot predict the exact timing we expect to win new contracts leading to resumption of zolteks rapid sales growth all the major wind turbine producers are designing longer blades and at some length which may be different for each turbine company carbon fiber reinforcement becomes necessary and economically competitive
3169233 the fundamentals of alternative energy generally and wind energy in particular are strong and growing and we expect that growth will continue for many years to come this business is not going away over the next few years its only going to get much bigger
3169234 this demonstration project follows a smaller scale project and if successful will bring us a giant step closer to making carbon fiber a critical part of the mix in deep sea oil and gas production
3169235 the plant in guadalajara is a key building block in rapidly ramping up carbon fibers production over the next several years
3169236 we have been able to successfully retrofit this plant to produce precursor validating our belief that it represented a unique opportunity to expeditiously add capacity at substantially lower capital costs than new construction in addition with profitable operations and ample financial resources we believe zoltek is poised to capitalize on the opportunities that await us

3169259 for me its special because i used this to discover the farthest planet that has ever been discovered
3169260 my own program was to discover extrasolar planets at the farthest ranges we can see hst is the only one which can do that
3169261 personally my work in black holes would not have been possible without hst showing that nearly all galaxies contain a massive black hole in their center and that the black hole is an essential component for why galaxies look the way they do
3169262 were still doing good science with it and what appears to threaten its lifetime is not the spacecraft itself but rather our ability to send vehicles up for maintenance
3169263 what is arguably the most important contribution has been the inclusion of the public in the science from hst
3169264 the real contribution from hst has yet to be realized as it has hopefully inspired a generation of scientists to be leaders for the u s and the world

3169315 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city

3169320 the ubiquitous tyropitta bears little resemblance to the dizzying variety of savory and sweet cheese based domokou and honey pies popular throughout greek regional cuisine in this version from the cycladic island of folegandros the filling is flavored with onions almost as strong a presence as the feta and encased in a thick bread crust kalasouna was traditionally made on saturdays the same day on which bread was baked since the shell was made from a piece of the leavened dough to which some olive oil was added this version is slightly simpler but as tasty
3169321 this is a seasoning mix for quick spicy chai unlike most recipes the seasoning mix can be prepared ahead and stored in the refrigerator until needed also neither the spices nor the tea are cooked just add this to any brewed black tea a warning it is very spicy and amounts of the mix can be adjusted to personal taste

3169323 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3169324 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3169325 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3169326 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3169327 theres a slice in my neck its been there since before i was born i was breathing like a fish in a womb

3169330 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3169331 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3169332 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3169333 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3169334 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3169335 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3169336 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3169337 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3169338 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3169339 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3169340 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3169341 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3169342 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3169343 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3169344 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3169345 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3169346 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3169347 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3169348 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3169349 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3169350 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3169351 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit more
3169352 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3169353 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3169354 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3169355 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3169356 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3169357 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
3169358 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
3169359 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
3169360 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
3169361 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
3169362 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
3169363 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
3169364 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3169365 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3169366 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3169367 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3169368 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3169369 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3169370 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3169371 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3169372 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3169373 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3169374 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3169375 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3169376 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
3169377 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
3169378 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
3169379 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
3169380 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
3169381 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
3169382 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
3169383 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock
3169384 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3169385 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3169386 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3169387 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3169388 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3169389 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3169390 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3169391 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3169392 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3169393 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3169394 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3169395 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3169396 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3169397 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3169398 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3169399 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3169400 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3169401 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3169402 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3169403 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region

3169540 after seven years of blind alleys and false accusations we have to ask well has the fbi once again let their zeal replace evidence
3169541 a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on sunday
3169542 evidence amassed by f b i investigators against dr bruce e ivins was largely circumstantial
3169543 newly released fbi evidence makes a strong circumstantial case that bioweapons researcher ivins was a delusional sociopath who had the opportunity motive and means to be the 2001 anthrax killer
3169544 a flask of anthrax spores recovered in 2004 from ivins personal workspace at ft detrick the army weapons lab where he worked
3169545 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3169546 it may well be that absent a trial it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against ivins
3169547 but this is a circumstantial case with no absolute proof that he did it
3169548 amy the fbi says it can trace the anthrax used in the attacks directly to dr ivins and it says he repeatedly tried to mislead investigators
3169549 tonight a lawyer for dr ivins says the fbi never found anthrax in his house or in his car or anything else directly linking him to the mailings
3169550 and without a trial well never hear what dr ivins wouldve said in his own defense
3169551 even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask the anthrax spores that were in that flask charlie a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it
3169552 oh by the way lets give you the reasons to why we think he sent out and went on this homicidal rage
3169553 well he helped develop a vaccine for anthrax he probably wanted to continue to see that developed so that by killing people by having come up with some unknown way of this high military grade anthrax we would keep the vaccine program going
3169554 hes involved hes got a role in it hes done something
3169555 you have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound
3169556 ive got the joy joy joy joy down in my heart to stay
3169557 you will make known to me the path of life in your presence is fullness of
3169558 you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has anointed you with the oil of joy above your fellows rejoice in the lord you who are righteous and praise his holy name

3169617 mengapa engkau tidak ikut memunguti uang dinar itu seperti tetangga engkau
3169618 sebab yang mereka cari uang dinar sebagai bekal dunia sedangkan yang saya perlukan bukan dinar melainkan bekal akhirat
3169619 maksud saya uang dunia sudah cukup yang masih saya perlukan adalah bekal akhirat iaitu sholat puasa dan zikir sebab perjalanan di dunia amat pendek dibanding dengan pengembaraan di akhirat yang panjang dan kekal
3169620 ada beberapa sebab pertama dengan memecahkan gelas ini bererti berkurang kekayaan tuan tetapi menurut saya hal itu lebih baik daripada wibawa tuan berkurag lantaran perintah tuan tidak dipatuhi
3169621 kedua saya hanya menaati perintah allah sebab di dalam al quran allah memerintahkan agar kita mematuhi allah utusan nya dan para penguasa sedangkan tuan adalah penguasa atau ulil amri maka dengan segala resikonya saya laksanakan perintah tuan
3169622 ketiga dengan saya memecahkan gelas itu orang orang akan menganggap saya gila namun hal itu lebih baik buat saya biarlah saya dicap gila daripada tidak melakukan perintah gubernurnya yang bererti saya sudah berbuat durhaka tuduhan saya gila akan saya terima dengan lapang dada daripada saya dituduh durhaka kepada penguasa saya itu lebih berat buat saya

3169630 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in
3169631 i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
3169632 hes a great guy with talent a good nose for the ball he brings a lot to the game im excited to have him here
3169633 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him
3169634 wouldnt it be funny if blacks character were a heroin addict and when hes out in the jungle he has to go cold turkey
3169635 weve acted to safeguard the interests of our citizens plus gmail were rude about my hair
3169636 we believe that high inflation will continue to be a threat in the next five years as policy rates are very low and commodity markets are very tight it will probably take a volker style effort of hiking rates aggressively to fight inflation eventually paul volker was chairman of the us federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 however in the next 12 months inflation will be falling and that is likely to be an important event for the market
3169637 disclosed to the sfo evidence that had come to light suggesting that in 2002 the company may have indirectly made two payments to the iraqi regime in breach of un sanctions
3169638 has recently been notified of allegations that certain historical contracts may have been procured through corrupt acts
3169639 the company will continue to cooperate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the sfo
3169640 the board of the company is committed to the current in depth review of policies and procedures and the subsequent training to ensure that all employees and international representatives comply fully with the mabey group code of ethics
3169641 the success of the model lies in being able to adapt what youre offering in the shortest time possible to what clients want
3169642 for inditex time is the principal factor to take into account more so than the costs of production
3169643 there are a few states that try to increase revenue this way and they give us all a bad name
3169644 were a very mobile society evert time you move mail goes astray
3169645 one of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a one size fits all mentality to one that reflects regional need customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009
3169646 our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment
3169647 some of this increase is also aimed for the first time at dealing with climate change related issues from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering
3169648 ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary
3169649 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3169650 the consumer council for water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in 130m of benefits in two years we will take the same approach in pressing ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015
3169651 that could allow younger children to be prevented from accessing certain material that parents might consider more suitable for older teenagers
3169652 endemol has always grown through acquisitions we are in an exploratory phase we have many projects open itv is just one of many
3169653 a clean disposal of the two businesses would obviously make sense loss elimination from overseas gives management one less thing to worry about and the prospect of italy in particular getting a lot worse before it gets better is a real one that said getting out cleanly will not be easy
3169654 the management of ennstone is considering a number of options open to it to strengthen the balance sheet we think these are more likely to take the form of either asset disposals or an equity fundraising the preference has to be for the former which could include all or part disposal of one of its overseas businesses a full update will be available at the interims in september which will allow us to better appraise the situation as it develops
3169655 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3169656 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3169657 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3169658 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3169659 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3169660 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3169661 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3169662 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3169663 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3169664 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3169665 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3169666 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3169667 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3169668 barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3169669 we have plans to include voices from across america who have never had the opportunity to participate before
3169670 each night of the convention will look very different than any convention we have seen in the past
3169671 that his employment became untenable as a result of the relationship and his employers response to it he is seeking a severance payment thought to be about a140 000 to compensate for this and for stress and harm suffered
3169672 some sort of industrial claim albeit misguided for a severance payment
3169673 the employee claimed and was successful in establishing that his stress was directly caused by his employers failure to keep him informed of changes in the workplace in essence the prospect of redundancy was seen as a sufficient causative factor in the employees work related injury
3169674 employers must assess the circumstances and sensitivities of individual workers when making management decisions in order to avoid stress claims being made or where claims are made to avoid liability for such claims
3169675 the damage caused to others by certain uses of property cannot be effectively charged to the owner of that property
3169676 the oaks are just too greedy we will make them give us light
3169677 every book every page any time or way you like
3169678 northern rock needs to ramp up new lending of low loan to value mortgages because they are not getting enough customers in to compensate for whats going out
3169679 these products represent northern rocks cautious approach to new lending to focus on the quality of customer that the bank is pursuing
3169680 mr fawoles actions were serious and blatant and he poses an immediate risk to lenders
3169681 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market activity
3169682 in terms of the outlook the july survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise albeit at a low level
3169683 it has been an encouraging month for sales 25 up on june and just 20 down on july 2007
3169684 conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding
3169685 the only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices ie repossessions new builds on large developments and the older rural properties the first time buyer is on the list of endangered species
3169686 with no let up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes forward orders pointed to further slowdown
3169687 with shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase core basics childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well
3169688 even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy
3169689 it frightened me i was always very as we would say on west 9th st ascared ascared of being judged
3169690 i know that its interesting then you can tell me what you think afterwards
3169691 im just an artist but i respect your opinion i felt that way when i saw the dark knight lately
3169692 jules is making a point as to how callous we have become and we will become more callous
3169693 i went out very privately and smoked a joint to keep focused so my only problem because it was just one shot was my mouth got a little dry
3169694 he used to let me shave him as he stood there fully dressed in his beret
3169695 it is not the slightest bit involving and is sadly lacking not only in substance but also in basic narrative structure it is hard to make poetry out of confusion
3169696 but he will undoubtedly be massacred by the film critics
3169697 it seemed he got lost in his car somewhere in the centovalli region
3169698 its problems of rhythm and the total absurdity of certain scenes are topped off by the platitude of the infrequent dialogue which ends up making everything insipid
3169699 those for whom his books are all about the sex scenes also risk disappointment the film has only got one the pen suits him much better than the camera
3169700 houellebecq hasnt managed to make a film with the same impact as his writing it is the usual modernist fare
3169701 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3169702 over the past year the negative impact of equities on scheme assets combined with falling bond yields have led to an overall worsening of the funding position resulting in a 8 6 increase in aggregate liabilities while weaker equities have reduced assets by 7 4
3169703 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly he was true to his art and respected by all the industry
3169704 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3169705 he had weight on stage this strong dominating physical presence when he came on there was a sense of something dangerous
3169706 that could allow younger children to be prevented from accessing certain material that parents might consider more suitable for older teenagers
3169707 our solid performance reported at the end of the first quarter has continued throughout the first half of the financial year
3169708 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investments portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
3169709 im not a married chap and i dont think my marital status is likely to change so im free to be a travelling gypsy
3169710 almost two thirds of the wage gap is because of reasons unexplained and one third is for reasons explained
3169711 this could be a result of women working in less skilled manufacturing positions or could be evidence of discrimination in that sector
3169712 the only reason people are here is theyve no place else to go
3169713 theres a lot to be said for making people laugh thats all some people have
3169714 hindi maliligaw ka talaga kasi pasikot sikot ang daan dun
3169715 i just knew gf ko baya si maymay dati matets younger sister
3169716 akala ko lumba lumba ka na im surprised that your still in good shape
3169717 we are moving petrol prices down in order to ensure we offer the best price locally
3169718 cheapest prices in many southern towns are still two to three pence per litre above what drivers are paying in areas where competitive supermarkets are engaged in a dogfight
3169719 since the all time high of 119 7p a litre for petrol and 133 25p for diesel the wholesale price for petrol coming into the uk has fallen 18 and 22 for diesel
3169720 this has yet to be reflected in average uk prices
3169721 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3169722 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3169723 zanu pf is not talking about conceding any real power they are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control these guys arent serious
3169724 the differences revolve around who will have power theyre not giving up anything on that they entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues
3169725 there is a lot of pressure on tsvangirai people in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the peoples will and democracy mugabe should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him
3169726 the pressure for us is coming from the people they dont want to see some kind of half hearted change if we were to do that we would lose credibility if morgan takes something cosmetic from zanu pf he will lose the support of the zimbabwean people
3169727 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
3169728 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
3169729 the parties discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and future reconstruction projects
3169730 my family does not know whether i am dead or alive we are not allowed to use phones so i was looking forward to my holiday but now i am too scared to leave because the taliban are waiting just outside and i will get killed
3169731 my boss said the flights are for priority staff only it seems some human life is more valuable than others
3169732 when we started here just over a year ago the situation wasnt as bad but now the taliban are increasing their attacks on us we need the company to give us protection i am speaking on behalf of all of us here in bastion
3169733 when i signed up for the job kbr promised to look after me and provide me security but none of this has happened they just threaten to sack us if we complain
3169734 i saw him leaving the night before and the next morning he was dead its very sad news for us he was a friend
3169735 they said at the interview that we could have access to a doctor but we are not even allowed to go to the clinic on the base
3169736 the safety and security of all employees remains kbrs top priority for locally recruited employees at camp bastion kbr has a process in place to monitor local security and safety on a daily basis
3169737 employees at camp bastion live in tents that differ from those provided to the british military the employee tents are equipped with air conditioning kbr also provides a contracted medical doctor on site and all employees have access to british military hospital facilities at camp bastion in an effort to ensure safe travel kbr offers employees the opportunity to fly via british military from camp bastion to kabul when taking leave
3169738 to generate sufficient advertising revenues to sustain its ongoing operation
3169739 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3169740 barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3169741 we have plans to include voices from across america who have never had the opportunity to participate before
3169742 each night of the convention will look very different than any convention we have seen in the past
3169743 he went to defend his sister and her children who live in south ossetia
3169744 but he never reached the place where they hand out weapons
3169745 his three year old daughter still thinks hes coming home
3169746 she begged him not to go but she couldnt stop him
3169747 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3169748 the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3169749 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3169750 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3169751 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake russia is using violence against georgia to intimidate other neighbours such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values
3169752 we heard statements saying that russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia in georgia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission
3169753 now we know the truth that these forces were there to rebuild the railway to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
3169754 they had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shia villages
3169755 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly who threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they are players that have to be protected
3169756 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3169757 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3169758 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3169759 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3169760 neither laws nor promises are needed what is required is effective action and the construction of a culture of legality
3169761 the country has faced these problems for years and citizens should demand solutions and participate in them
3169762 impunity is the main enemy of the rule of law
3169763 enough already we demand results we demand justice we demand security
3169764 often fundamentalists come to break up parties and set off bombs or fight with the military or the family to make instability
3169765 since the war everyone has been afraid and theyve reduced the weddings so its only at home its not so big and its without music because the fundamentalists and military dont allow it
3169766 some people only go to get the bride from her fathers home and take her away without any celebration
3169767 i was not in a high position it was normal within the university
3169768 but with the us invasion they were starting to kill many baathists and were making troubles for me so i decided to leave
3169769 the internet helps many young couples connect with each other and make a family
3169770 it was of course my dream to get married in baghdad but the particular situation was too difficult to arrange a marriage there and for me to go to iraq
3169771 i would like to get married to a woman who has education so i can have a discussion with her
3169772 the norwegians have given me peace and stability and this is what i hope to give to hind so that she does not sit at home and feel lonely
3169773 i love her and she loves me and everything will be ok this is most important but also she should learn the language so we can introduce her to the culture and the people and she will feel at home
3169774 now when the sun sets we should be at home before 2003 we could go to the theatre make excursions now its impossible its all closed
3169775 we live in a shia area so its not so bad as the mixed areas which is where they have the most problems but i still cant go with my friends on the streets
3169776 i think it will be not such a big problem because they have a few iraqi families there
3169777 my dream is to make a happy family and i will give 100 to fulfil that vision
3169778 i spend 1 000 riyals every a day on qat and i earn about 4 000
3169779 im sad that its there but i enjoy the culture
3169780 we have chews where we listen to music or talk politics but i dont want my staff to chew i dont want them to waste their money especially if they dont have very much
3169781 the decision not to use qat is not equivalent to the decision to decline drinks at a dinner party
3169782 it is much more important because it excludes the person from social contacts that are necessary for his business or private life
3169783 its got to the stage where foreign donors say the government needs to choose between qat and food
3169784 qat is a drug even if every yemeni will fight you if you say that it has all the symptoms its a cash crop that is part of a vicious cycle of internal bleeding people in this country are simply chewing their way to oblivion
3169785 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3169786 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
3169787 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
3169788 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3169789 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3169790 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3169791 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3169792 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3169793 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
3169794 she wasnt back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me and i love it
3169795 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous
3169796 im very grateful actually personally that i had a chance to get out and see so much of america because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in february and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign and chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother in the last three months alone i went to 350 different communities i got to see parts of america i never saw when i was running or serving and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
3169797 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change
3169798 i think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing
3169799 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
3169800 secondly because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand feeding the people that are there educating them providing basic healthcare having some near term economic strategy i think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them
3169801 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
3169802 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath
3169803 im not a government and i dont have access to vast amounts of money and im frustrated that even when the democrats are in we still havent given a tax credit for example for wind energy that goes more than three years
3169804 i just try to figure it out and i try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this because i was so struck by all these countries that wont meet their kyoto targets
3169805 one reason i went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow ill go home now and ill be able to tell people that i went to the highlands of ethiopia and saw a classroom with two led lights nobody will believe that and that it works economically for them
3169806 i just want very much the country to change course
3169807 i want us to be on a different economic course a different social policy course a different course in the world and were going to do what we can to be helpful
3169808 look what we were doing was working so you had to assume there was going to be some blow back
3169809 and im immensely proud of her but i think shes the political leader of our family now im not in politics and im going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision i think shes been big and positive and thats what we should all be
3169810 when they have more money they dont know what to do with it in rema
3169811 they are happy they dont need a mercedes or a television when they have money the men are always going to the bar the solar cinema is to show them what money can do how opportunity can come to their lives they have three meals a day but they dont know what is going on in the world
3169812 a new and much anticipated mark of socially responsible business practice
3169813 a growing number of high profile organisations are now part of the living wage employer group and london 2012 is set to be the first ever living wage olympics
3169814 this is not only morally right but makes good business sense contributing to better recruitment and retention of staff higher productivity and a more loyal workforce with high morale
3169815 for creating and implementing a sales and marketing scheme which significantly misstated the nature and stability of the auction rate market as a result thousands of investors were abandoned with illiquid investments
3169816 for the first time in history a crisis triggered by us housing finance problems is having global ramifications
3169817 financial crisis is heralded in fact defined by sharp discontinuities of asset prices
3169818 there is little doubt that the immediate cause of both the commodities price boom and the credit crisis has been low global interest rates
3169819 struck down by a sudden drying up of a food supply for which they have no responsibility
3169820 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3169821 she just completed a 78 5 mile road race i dont think
3169822 just 2 of articles and 1 of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and womens sports just 1 4 of sports photography featured women and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports pages there were more images of models footballers girlfriends the french presidents wife and a nun than of sportswomen
3169823 there were 367 links from the front page to articles but just five links went to female sports 1 there was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites out of 129 images both photos and film there were four images of women 3 sky sports did have a film of two female sports presenters a third image was of former big brother contestant kate lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot and a fourth image was of an advert for womens health
3169824 team ethos an interest in what the british team is doing as a whole there isnt a separation between male and female events
3169825 when you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court theres definitely an attitude that theyre looking for the feminine shot those moments when they can zoom in on a womans legs for example and then in all the tennis coverage theres the massive interest in fashion even the people who are interviewing the women post match will say how are you going to dress for tonights event which is a long way off the point
3169826 whats great with the olympics is the immediacy of it all you see the women competing and then theyre on the rostrum straight away looking incredibly natural and thats so great to see when it comes to tennis coverage there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now a lot of the promotion around wimbledon this year concerned parties for instance rather than just that specific focus on the sports field
3169827 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist

3169830 rusia ha invado un estado soberano vecino y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico elegido por su poblaci n
3169831 estoy profundamente preocupado por los informes de que las tropas rusas se han movido a la zona de conflicto atacado la ciudad georgiana de gori y amenazando la capital del pa s tbilisi
3169832 hay pruebas de que las fuerzas rusas podr an bombardear pronto el aeropuerto civil de la capital si estas informaciones son precisas las acciones rusas representar an una escalada dr stica y brutal del conflicto en georgia
3169833 inconsistente con las afirmaciones que hemos recibido de rusia de que sus objetivos se limitaban a reestablecer el status quo

3169835 this convention of churches resides in a strategic partnership with the mission boards of the southern baptist convention and this service of worship will dynamically reveal just how magnificent the work of the international mission board truly is because of the faithful sacrifice and investment of local southern baptist churches
3169836 we are living in crucial times for the proclamation of the gospel
3169837 and it is during moments like these when we come together as a family of southern baptist churches where we thank god for his mighty power in calling out men and women for missionary service its a time to recommit our lives and our churches to investing in the missionary imperative given to us by the lord jesus christ
3169838 we stand on the shoulders of giants who have left us a legacy of faithfulness and zeal for the gospel that we dare not abandon
3169839 i am prayerfully anticipating that this service of worship will be a time when all north carolina baptists come together expecting a mighty move of god in our midst i hope every church throughout the baptist state convention of north carolina will send a large delegation to greensboro to participate and display before a watching world the vital connection between local churches state conventions and the national entities of the southern baptist convention it is here we find our purpose as a denomination to go into all the world and preach the gospel of the lord jesus christ
3169840 most southern baptists have no idea what the imb does every day for the missionaries who are serving on international fields of service
3169841 since the early days of our conventions founding a critical concern has been for the nations of the world and the mandate of jesus to proclaim the gospel to every creature this podcast shows how that priority continues to be accomplished from the early beginnings in 1845 to the present
3169842 the sacred trust given us by the churches of the southern baptist convention
3169843 we are about making sure that those who are called of god for service with us are prepared and carefully deployed in ways which would be the best for them and their family as they work to win people to the lord
3169844 and we do not allow or any sort of magical thinking to enter our work especially in muslim countries where becoming a christian could easily result in death
3169845 anyone who listens to this podcast will come away with not only a better understanding of the mission and day to day operations of the international mission board but a greater understanding of missiology in general and how the imb is working to saturate the world with the gospel of the lord jesus christ
3169846 the vital work of the imb and the partnerships of local churches to pray give and encourage cannot be overstated and these imb leaders represent some of southern baptists finest statesmen

3169852 tell your thesis then tell it ten times again in broader ways and say it one more time to conclude
3169853 there are nevertheless many people today who still think that an artist is someone who draws realistically indeed the training given in many art schools seem to agree with the perception gradually however more people are realizing that the twentieth century artist is not neccessarily someone who draws well but someone who thinks well

3169858 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3169859 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3169860 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3169861 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3169862 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3169863 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3169864 i think its important to show what kids really use
3169865 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3169866 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3169867 and were all like where are we going to hide

3169870 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make
3169871 he atwater had been seen with that weapon prior to this crime
3169872 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3169873 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals
3169874 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3169875 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3169876 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow the 200 free final thats my first priority
3169877 i started off with the hardest one im just out there to swim and have fun and thats what im doing
3169878 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3169879 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong
3169880 a lot of people are like what in the heck are you doing in that but its really nice to be in an event where theres no pressure on me and no ones expecting anything
3169881 it makes me feel like an age group swimmer because i keep improving
3169882 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3169883 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3169884 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3169885 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3169886 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3169887 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3169888 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3169889 but then after my 100th phone call i was like ok
3169890 i put my heart and soul into what i do
3169891 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3169892 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3169893 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3169894 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
3169895 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3169896 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3169897 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3169898 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3169899 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3169900 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3169901 i thought i had a good chance with frank but it wasnt for sure
3169902 i was shooting for the top 10 and then it was going to be up to the judge
3169903 i was just kind of shocked then really really excited
3169904 i was looking for an animal with balance who would stand well and who had a straight back
3169905 now he has thickness through the top of his back and hes finished hes got enough fat over his ribs
3169906 they had decided ahead of time that there would be no hard feelings if one won
3169907 voting for who should be the next president of the united states is a significant decision for anyone to make i am an undecided voter at the moment because i do not want to make an uninformed choice i continue to learn about the candidates every day from watching the news discussing with family and friends reading the newspaper and researching online i have reviewed both mccain and obamas policies and cannot completely agree or disagree with either of them several of the policies that are important to me include the economy health care iraq and iran i still think that there is more to learn about the candidates and i will make a decision once i feel that i am completely informed
3169908 with all that is going on with our country right now we need a president that will fix the major problems poor economy a never ending war high gas prices uncertainty of environmental health high medical costs yearly increases in college tuition and a high national debt the person i see making a dent in this list is barack obama in fact he seems like the only one that actually cares about the problems listed above he promises change and while i know that change can be an empty promise i believe he intends on delivering our country is ready to be out of this war but i understand that just pulling out isnt the answer i do think however that getting out safely and rebuilding iraq should be top priority for us how are we ever going to get out and make peace if we dont make it a goal the main argument i hear against him is that all of his plans will increase taxes some probably will however i believe that if we want things to happen we have to pay for them id rather pay today for universal health care than pay later for this war unlike bush who cut taxes but spent five times what clinton did i dont believe increasing national debt is the fiscally responsible thing to do look at what it has done to the current economy
3169909 i am going to be voting for barack obama i admit that though he stands out to me as the better candidate barack obama is by no means a perfect one his proposals and intended actions upon obtaining the presidency however thorough and intelligent are not always going to be economically feasible nor will they always turn out to be the best course of action and that is where my true faith in barack obama really comes into play his willingness to listen and consider all sides of a situation at the very least to a greater degree than what i have seen in john mccain can only help him make better decisions whether that decision be to revise his thinking or to continue as planned this quality and his intelligent and eloquent speaking abilities will help him to bring people together in the best interest of our country and that is exactly what a good leader should do
3169910 based on preliminary information of what occurred its being investigated as a possible attack on a federal agent
3169911 we are talking about a violent person not someone you want playing with your kids
3169912 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3169913 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3169914 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3169915 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3169916 go away the police told us not to talk to you
3169917 now i dont know if i will be here tomorrow i have five children a wife what will happen to us
3169918 two years from now you wont see them inside the site
3169919 i dont know what it was like before but i feel very comfortable and secure

3169927 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
3169928 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
3169929 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
3169930 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
3169931 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
3169932 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
3169933 a lot of people do think its a joke until they get out there and see them run or ride one
3169934 once they do that they realize whoo hoo these things get it on
3169935 were enjoying ourselves its grass roots its something that anybody out there can afford and its more comedy than you can have
3169936 the thing about this is that people are in it to have fun
3169937 you can start with a basic machine and can spend 1 500 and have a very competitive machine
3169938 that figure includes all of my building and revamping and adjusting and making things safe
3169939 no fear helps or no brains however you want to put it
3169940 we would like people to get a copy of the mower head rules before building a mower

3169942 its just kind of snowballed ive been getting calls from people ive never met in my life
3169943 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
3169944 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3169945 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3169946 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3169947 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3169948 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3169949 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
3169950 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
3169951 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
3169952 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
3169953 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
3169954 was laying in bed and watching tv and then all of a sudden boom

3169977 in the dealings between international powers i e russia and the u s iran has to be very careful
3169978 yet as castellanos admits to me all these explanations leave many things unspoken or perhaps
3169979 what makes obama s task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly
3169980 what s clear is that among older less educated white voters there is a pronounced albeit inchoate unease with obama s otherness one that the mccain operation is moving swiftly to exploit with what promises to be an increasingly race freighted campaign
