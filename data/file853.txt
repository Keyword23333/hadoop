8530019 i was at the fair because my college radio station radio k where music matters most aka suck it mark wheat was broadcasting live from the stage designated for the university of minnesota for two hours a day i had giddly signed up two weeks prior knowing that while it might just be me playing indie rock songs on all three of my college radio stations anemic signals that did not change the fact that i would be playing indie rock songs at the state fair a place where every local radio man woman i idolized as a child had performed as small as it might have been it was still doing a live broadcast in front of possibly thousands of people i guess its sort of like performing the sound checks at woodstock or designing the guest brochures at the louvre you might be a pissant but god damnit youre there

8530047 theres a lot of pressure on him to come in here and start in a league with some very good defensive ends and linebackers who are coming his way
8530048 hes doing well right now hes picking up the offense well because he has been in there since otas organized team activities by now he should have it
8530049 he came in and felt right at home at that left tackle spot
8530050 hes smart youre not going to beat him with the same move twice its a good challenge for him and for me we make each other better by game one of the regular season he should be really comfortable
8530051 yo os digo barack obama est preparado para liderar am rica y restaurar el liderazgo de am rica en el mundo
8530052 est preparado para preservar proteger y defender la constituci n de estados unidos barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8530053 estos tiempos requieren algo m s que un buen soldado exigen un l der sabio a alguien que pueda llevarnos hacia el cambio que todos sabemos que hay que hacer y que necesitamos
8530054 lo que es tener a un presidente que pone a los ciudadanos por delante
8530055 i see positives to either side i really do i kind of sit on the fence plus im also one of those guys who hey if they tell you to play out in a farm field thats where you play
8530056 muligheten for kommersiell drift vil over tid kunne falle bort betal tv operat rene vil falle fra og bakkenettets nedslagsfelt vil kunne bli avgrenset til nordmenn bosatt i satellittskygger med en slik utvikling vil en relativt stor befolkningsgruppe ikke kunne motta andre tv kanaler enn nrks

8530058 actually hes such a good athlete that i would have been in full support either way
8530059 i think in a sense in football your athleticism starts to level out in baseball guys like him dont come around that often
8530060 the first thing out of their mouths is is he a baseball guy
8530061 if he was to come out and say that hes a football kid he would have offers from almost every school around
8530062 ive thought about it a lot but im a baseball player and ive always been that way
8530063 probably yelling at my mom to make me a sandwich
8530064 from our end hes just a great athlete but what i like about him is that hes a humble kid hes coachable and he listens
8530065 stanford thinks hes the best center fielder in the country
8530066 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8530067 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8530068 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8530069 youre sitting more in the center of the field than cornerbacks and youve got receivers coming at you who can go to the left or to watch video of cu coach dan hawkins on first day of practice watch video of cu freshman running back darrell scott watch video of cu beginning fall practice play pickem for the upcoming cu football game the right corners are usually on one side of the field so they have less ground to cover
8530070 you have to show up for the run support and also be fast enough to cover receivers
8530071 you have to be a little bigger than regular cornerbacks and athletic at the same time
8530072 hes become more intelligent on the field he knows what to do and what not to do i think this will be a big year for him
8530073 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8530074 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and looking forward to the upcoming season
8530075 joe instructed me from the get go to advise any team that inquired that he was either going to play for the avs or retire
8530076 thats what i did even in situations where the teams said is there even any point in us making an offer joe said tell them no
8530077 having him return is great for our franchise and community but also for the game of hockey
8530078 its great for everybody that hell be back we all knew that he could still play the game at a high level and i think hell have a real good year for us ive obviously played with him a long time and i know i didnt want to see him go just yet then i would have been the oldest guy
8530079 you look at what their new coaches have done before at some point you have to kind of prepare for the unknown they might do this they might do that you just have to be ready to adjust
8530080 if steve presents an idea and someone has a better idea we put it in its a collaborative effort
8530081 they could have a brand new defense and a brand new offense too
8530082 theres always uncertainty with any opening game you need to have a bunch of what ifs ready to go
8530083 with coach fairchild coming from the nfl you dont know if hes taking a page from his old days at csu or from buffalo or st louis
8530084 if he doesnt have four maybe people will think he hasnt played as well as a year ago
8530085 he did some damage to us last year and hes going to enjoy some time in the nfl soon
8530086 i take it as a privilege to play against somebody of his caliber
8530087 we spent a lot of time on one look and they gave us another
8530088 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8530089 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8530090 marked enlargement of his heart which had been failing for some time
8530091 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8530092 they have to be extremely assertive on and off the field we are looking for leadership from those guys i expect every one of them to improve their game from last year were counting on it
8530093 i would definitely like for all of my numbers to go up but for our defensive line as a whole i think we need to make more sacks and more tackles to be successful
8530094 most of all we need to be leaders and for us to have success we have to play to our potential every game we have to play to our potential
8530095 i prefer playing inside its more of a battle all the time
8530096 im more of an in the trenches guy i like that better
8530097 and i plan on working on it over the winter to make sure it does it definitely has more in it
8530098 over half of the teenagers we polled said their parents give them money if they run out and one in five knows they will get what they want if they are persistent enough
8530099 the perfect guy for us because he knows this market along with everybody in town
8530100 most grape production in chile takes place during u s winter months when there is little or no fresh grape production within the united states with which to compete
8530101 we know theres going to be overarching concern over the possible introduction of pests
8530102 once we do the analysis well be advocating our position accordingly

8530107 meraviglioso ed una grande emozione tornare in questa citt ho tanti ricordi che mi legano a vico equense e il luogo dove solitamente venivo quando marinavo la scuola sono veramente felice di esservi ritornato nella veste di comico e parlare ad una platea cos folta

8530112 emin has turned her life into a public spectacle like no other artist before her
8530113 by the end of this show i felt as if someone had been shouting at me down the phone for a couple of hours a kind of emotional earache

8530120 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really weren t there
8530121 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and let s vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8530122 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us what s important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8530123 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8530124 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8530125 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but that s so weak that we tend to miss it
8530126 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8530127 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of i m receptive and so forth
8530128 she s a beautiful woman you know her hugs are genuine she has those beautiful high cheek bones that we see in models the broad shoulders she had a wide stance her gestures are huge they are very encompassing these things draw us in these are the things we look for otherwise just hand out a memo

8530236 offer him anything say youll make him a god theres bound to be a backward planet or two we can take over
8530237 making people gods isnt the job of the us military doctor mckay
8530238 if youre looking for a pay increase youll probably get it
8530239 doctor mckay isnt authorised to speak for the us military major you need to keep that in mind
8530240 yeah i told him being god of a backward planet wasnt my style
8530241 i owe daniel ten bucks so since you dont wanna be god of a backward planet what do you want
8530242 you might have noticed in my record im a sentinel
8530243 major so far as im concerned hes all yours but the military doesnt arrange bondings
8530244 leave that to me general i just need to have it confirmed that there wont be a problem with me claiming mckay

8530254 it is important that people understand both the dangers of obesity and the benefits to their health of losing weight

8530256 hillary clinton gave a big speech at the democratic convention in support of barack obama experts say it was the longest speech ever delivered entirely through clenched teeth
8530257 features a character named the white devil and a killer who draws pentagrams near his unfortunate victims so the pentagram star icon was incredibly well suited to this book
8530258 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8530259 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change barack obama will deliver that change
8530260 im pretty sure it was when my sister was at ursuline academy in wilmington delaware and joe was at archmere academy claymont

8530272 this is the time when adults are looking for a hideaway
8530273 and a comedy club is a place where they go and hide now that the kids are in school
8530274 for a generation certain evangelical teachers have told us that the gifts of the spirit ceased at the death of the apostles or at the completion of the new testament this of course is a doctrine without a syllable of biblical authority back of it the result of this erroneous teaching is that spiritually gifted persons are ominously few among us this frightening hour calls aloud for men with the gift of prophetic insight instead we have men who conduct surveys polls and panel discussions we need men with the gift of knowledge in their place we have men with scholarship nothing more thus we may be preparing ourselves for the tragic hour when god may set us aside as so called evangelicals and raise up another movement to keep new testament christianity alive in the earth the truth of the matter is that the scriptures plainly imply the imperative of possessing the gifts of the spirit but i must also add a word of caution the various spiritual gifts are not equally valuable as paul so carefully explains certain brethren have magnified one gift out of seventeen out of all proportion among these brethren there have been and are many godly souls but the general moral results of this teaching have nevertheless not been good in practice it has resulted in much shameless exhibitionism a tendency to depend upon experiences instead of upon christ and often a lack of ability to distinguish the works of the flesh from the operations of the spirit those who deny that the gifts are for us today and those who insist upon making a hobby of one gift are both wrong and we are all suffering the consequences of their error
8530275 using a particularly potent brand of weed killer an anonymous vandal inscribed obscenities on the lawns of three gardens in the early hours of sunday morning the weed killer destroyed the grass leaving the vandals work visible for all to see on one lawn the words sod this could be read from right across the street common decency prevents this paper from printing the words on the other lawns
8530276 you expect this sort of thing in inner city slums not here it was revolting reading that on my lawn there are children in the village who pass my house every day
8530277 the weed killer graffiti appearing as it did overnight and apparently out of thin air has been likened to the plague of crop circles which baffled local people in recent years however the use of slang obscenities would seem to indicate that this was not the work of alien life forms

8530284 are things really that bad that youre happy to be here
8530285 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8530286 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8530287 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8530288 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8530289 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8530290 he went through all the tests that he needed to do to make sure that he would be available so ill make a decision nearer the game but he should be okay
8530291 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test the response was clear togetherness focus and efficiency
8530292 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8530293 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8530294 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8530295 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8530296 i was delighted with dirk kuyt his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8530297 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8530298 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8530299 it felt like i was holding a car boot sale
8530300 everyone gathered around to claim what was theirs thats mine that is they would say
8530301 an isolated item may not seem like much but this has amounted to its own mini crimewave
8530302 although it is a very funny incident and a childish prank there are serious undertones as these are still crimes
8530303 these kids have made their own little den with the property of other people
8530304 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite sea side destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
8530305 to try and predict what these places will look like in the future the national trust has carried out research examining how things like sealevel rise and increased storminess will affect all our coastal sites
8530306 at the national trust we believe in working with natural processes wherever possible

8530311 obviously the moneys available and you get a fantastic return when you invest in the security of public health here in the province
8530312 when you no longer have nine or 10 ceos and you have one theres an obvious cost savings there long term
8530313 but i want to emphasize that the changes were making in health care are not about cost savings theyre about providing a more efficient effective health care system
8530314 will be given a clear number of who got what
8530315 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8530316 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8530317 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8530318 demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practise medicine and is suffering from an ailment that might if the physician were permitted to practise constitute a danger to the public
8530319 there may be times when there is someone involved in that process who would be harmed or embarrassed by the release of the name and or there may be times when the actual release of the physicians name would be extremely harmful to the physician
8530320 if there is serious reason to question the competence of this doctor the patients are entitled to know if it was their doctor and that they might wish to seek a second opinion
8530321 theyre claiming that there is a safety concern but its not named and its not explained that has led them to protect the identity of this particular doctor there is always a balance
8530322 but when you put on one side of the scale the potential health and safety of all this doctors patients i find it difficult to imagine what you would put on the other side of this scale that would justify not alerting patients to the danger that they may need to seek a second opinion
8530323 what we do is if its necessary the physician will withdraw from practice and at that point of course its obvious and the physician isnt practising and so thats our ability to say that the public is no longer at risk
8530324 the colleges first duty is to protect the public i think that by concealing the doctors name they are in effect preventing people from engaging in the kind of prudent checking that i think i would want

8530337 certainly all the vascular diseases like hypertension heart disease and
8530338 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8530339 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8530340 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8530341 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8530342 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8530343 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8530344 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8530345 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8530346 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8530347 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8530348 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8530349 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8530350 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8530351 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8530352 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8530353 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8530354 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8530355 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8530356 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8530357 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8530358 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8530359 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8530360 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8530361 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8530362 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8530363 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8530364 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8530365 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8530366 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8530373 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8530374 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8530375 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8530376 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8530377 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8530378 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8530379 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8530380 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8530382 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8530383 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8530384 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8530385 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8530386 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8530387 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8530388 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8530389 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8530390 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8530391 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8530392 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8530393 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8530394 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8530395 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8530396 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8530397 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8530398 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8530399 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8530400 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8530401 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8530402 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8530403 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8530404 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8530405 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8530406 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8530407 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8530408 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8530409 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8530410 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8530411 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8530412 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8530413 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8530424 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8530425 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8530426 we were obviously disappointed that members decided to overturn the advice of their officers at the development control committee in august 2007 and to also contest the appeal against the advice of their barrister
8530427 as a company we have incurred significant costs not only in terms of representation during the appeal but also in terms of delay
8530428 whilst we note your comments we will in this instance be seeking full costs
8530429 we may be able to come to a compromise where the company pays half of our costs

8530439 its not unusual for officers to move posts around the force and in different departments for a number of reasons which include both operational and development purposes
8530440 the post in saltburn will not be vacant there will be a new officer starting on august 31

8530458 inherently complex and paradoxical on the one hand there is the magnificence of russian authors artists and composers from tolstoy to repin to rachmaninov pasternak to faberg to mussorgsky on the other though we must grapple with the specter of communist russia the terrors of the gulag concentration camps and the soviet unions paralyzing economic and cultural inertia
8530459 in a nation still tyrannized by secret police and rigid government controls empathy and compassion seem far away a more fulfilling identity is surely to be found where such notions are central
8530460 perhaps the greatest lesson is that despite its strength and religious heritage russias identity like so many identities the world over has persistently lacked the sustainable moral element that underlies a sense of community which in turn is central to a sense of identity who we are and where we fit in the greater scheme of things
8530461 this project is moving ahead as planned management is optimistic regarding this prospect that lies in a historically productive mining region not only is this prospect moving forward but several other projects are also expected to be advanced in the coming weeks and months
8530462 boris johnson made it clear during his election campaign that he did not want to be on the payroll of hugo chavez and did not believe a poor south american country should be subsidising one of the wealthiest cities in the world
8530463 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8530464 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8530465 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8530466 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution

8530477 i wanted to learn how we could run a stateless government without physical infrastructure
8530478 trying to keep up with the engineering work and data capability that were doing makes no sense

8530487 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8530488 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8530489 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8530495 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8530496 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8530497 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8530498 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8530499 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8530500 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8530501 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8530502 we have listened to what the union said on pensions

8530537 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8530538 what were doing is supporting scolari in terms of how he wants to change the style and therefore were very comfortable it will turn out to be a good investment
8530539 the manager is absolutely confident of the players ability and that his mentality will fit in with chelsea
8530540 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8530541 the response from the weekend was clear togetherness focus and efficiency
8530542 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8530543 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8530544 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8530545 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression

8530550 broadcom is pleased to support the wirelesshd consortium as a promoter company and recognizes the importance of creating an industry led effort for a next generation wireless digital network interface specification that enables the seamless delivery of voice video data and multimedia
8530551 as the first and only wireless digital interface that combines true uncompressed high definition video multi channel audio intelligent format and control data and hollywood approved content protection we look forward to working with the wirelesshd consortium to achieve the mutual goal of providing consumers with a quick simple and secure way to connect and transmit hd content among a wide range of digital devices
8530552 broadcom has been a long time proponent and leader in the standardization and certification of a variety of communications technologies their experience and diversity of product categories will assist the consortium in achieving a widely implemented and interoperable standard
8530553 broadcoms wired and wireless technology expertise at the communications core level provides additional synergies that will provide more reliable and robust communications between wirelesshd enabled devices we are excited to work with broadcom to reinvent the way consumers access control and experience their multimedia content
8530554 then of course when we came out and started marching there were all of these people coming from every corner of the country
8530555 will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood
8530556 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8530557 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8530558 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8530559 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8530560 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8530561 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8530562 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back
8530563 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8530564 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8530565 although i know a lot have suffered way more than we have its like having some kind of arriving
8530566 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8530567 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8530568 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8530569 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8530570 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8530571 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8530572 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8530573 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8530574 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8530575 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8530576 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8530577 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8530578 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8530579 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8530580 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8530581 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8530582 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8530583 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8530584 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8530585 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8530586 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8530587 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8530588 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8530589 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8530590 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it
8530591 i would very much urge my side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle to provide an affirmative vote
8530592 obama would not be where he is or even close without that 2004 keynote
8530593 words that shook the world 100 years of unforgettable speeches and events
8530594 if the voter base begins to feel like all hes interested in is the big numbers and isnt interested in the individual especially those independents and crossover republicans
8530595 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8530596 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8530597 post convention florida should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8530598 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8530599 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8530600 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8530601 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8530602 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8530603 members of congress have access to these donors any day of the week
8530604 the market environment is bad with investors seeing a deterioration in the economic outlook for japan and the world and an increasing number of bankruptcies
8530605 doubts are also growing that the july september earnings reports will turn out to be sluggish

8530620 weve played the game a lot and think its five star its got over 80 levels and the final one is really hard when you have to blow up fireballs that are coming at you
8530621 were all pleased with the game and hoping for a good response now its on sale at our website
8530622 we currently have two more games in various stages of production and hope to start creating more sophisticated 3d games that will put wales on the map in the computer games industry
8530623 the computer games industry is one of the biggest in the world yet there are very few companies in wales making games as a result many people like myself who are gaining degrees in computer game design are having to leave the country in order to find jobs
8530624 newports university has two excellent computer games development courses producing talented students with lots of potential it seems ludicrous that wales is losing them to other countries because we have no computer games industry
8530625 the release of this game represents a considerable success for adam and his team at dark rock
8530626 at newport we believe its essential to maintain close links with the computer games industry to enable our students to successfully find jobs when they graduate we already have graduates working for major games companies such as sega and blitz and this year sees the first woman graduate from the course
8530627 the university has now helped more than 65 graduates set up their own business
8530628 we have many enterprising students who posses a diverse range of talent and we help them by providing funding and the business skills necessary to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and ensure the future growth and prosperity of wales

8530646 the next tax cut needs to be paid for by spending cuts
8530647 barack obama would reduce the deficit with the things he has proposed

8530654 they dont wear corporate logos for anybody theyre going to endorse obama the way they want
8530655 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8530656 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8530657 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities
8530658 my bet will be they will definitely be able to unload it
8530659 that free season pass makes it worthwhile camping out for a week

8530663 we have seen some slight traffic decrease but nothing abnormal compared to other retailers

8530669 we encourage everyone who can afford to volunteer for a furlough to please do so as it will reduce the number of flight attendants who potentially face an involuntary furlough
8530670 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take actions to enable united to compete in an environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult and necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation

8530679 because your phone isnt due for an upgrade the iphone will cost you 399

8530681 thats for new lines or phones due for an upgrade we dont care that you have been a customer for years youll have to pay 399 for that iphone while anyone who has never been our customer and we have absolutely no relationship with can get it for 200 cheaper we want to screw you our long and loyal customer as hard as possible
8530682 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8530683 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8530684 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8530685 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8530686 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8530687 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8530688 i know if theres any way that she could come back and teach i know she would do it in a second
8530689 i heard that your husband was deployed and i thought i could give you a break and bring over dinner
8530690 when she came to us initially we thought she was just going to lend us her name
8530691 but it turns out that she was a volunteer who got down into the trenches with us to fund raise
8530692 she was always there rooting you on no matter what no matter whether it was for an exam or at a football game
8530693 it was joe the boys and the state of delaware
8530694 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8530695 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8530696 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8530697 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8530698 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8530699 you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8530700 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8530701 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8530702 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8530703 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8530704 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8530705 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8530706 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8530707 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8530708 sie k nnten schon gewonnen haben kein kauf n tig details innen liegend

8530710 how about those volcanoes dumping c02 into the atmosphere stupid global warming people telling us it was us humans
8530711 hey did i ever tell you about the time i picked up the three nephites hitchhiking just outside of panguitch
8530712 you have this paper with provocative conclusions on multiracial identity that was first written in july 2005 being published in this final version in august 2008
8530713 hmm why is this issue suddenly on the national horizon oh right the presidential campaign its hard not to wonder whether theres a larger agenda
8530714 i dont know what their objective was but this is a paper with a surprising number of problems
8530715 theres so much more going on here than what theyre saying that the decisions they make look capricious at a minimum
8530716 among scholars who study multiracial identity i dont think any of us believe in that hypothesis
8530717 its the most controversial take its basically the reason used to keep interracial marriages illegal until the 1960s at best we might use it as a straw man
8530718 you have this assumption that blacks are one monolithic population whites are another monolithic population and multiracials are the monolithic blending between them
8530719 you may be a little slow to acquire language but once you do you find it easier to understand syntax and pronunciation for other languages as well straddling cultures may add risks but if we can address those risks it flips over into a strength
8530720 were talking about mixed identities in the public arena like never before
8530721 over the last 10 years youve had a new prominence of people who identify in fluid and dynamic ways barack obama being just one example
8530722 is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8530723 they are human beings with an inalienable right to live
8530724 the car was here and i was here and the bread delivery truck was backing up out of this driveway and so it is evident that the right of way clearly belonged to me
8530725 in my big gas guzzler i do not have to attend to the regulations of ordinary humans
8530726 breakfast is very different they really have a love of bread
8530727 they surround the bull horned protesters in a massive show of force
8530728 there are a number of mccain supporters trying to lure disaffected hillary supporters to events claiming to honor her but sponsored by mccain as shown at the bottom of their flyers
8530729 but there is no way the dems would want a show where a character
8530730 sings if thats being red you can call me pinko
8530731 im sorry my boyfriend swallowed a candle in santa barbara
8530732 thereve been bootlegs of various aspects of the labels but nothing that gives a broad view of them especially trilon which did all sorts of things
8530733 one of them would wear a kilt the guy who played the accordion did this sort of frozen face act that drew a lot of laughs
8530734 geddins wanted people to remember what the old blues sounded like and that would induce them to go out and buy it
8530735 that was the opposite view to what other producers thought which was that black people would avoid the music because they didnt want to be reminded of being back home and working in the cotton fields
8530736 she called me a hound dog but i found myself a home got all the meat i want dont have to gnaw your bone
8530737 all i do is gather the material sequence it and send it to them
8530738 obviously the moneys available and you get a fantastic return when you invest in the security of public health here in the province
8530739 when you no longer have nine or 10 ceos and you have one theres an obvious cost savings there long term
8530740 but i want to emphasize that the changes were making in health care are not about cost savings theyre about providing a more efficient effective health care system
8530741 will be given a clear number of who got what
8530742 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8530743 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8530744 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8530745 demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practise medicine and is suffering from an ailment that might if the physician were permitted to practise constitute a danger to the public
8530746 there may be times when there is someone involved in that process who would be harmed or embarrassed by the release of the name and or there may be times when the actual release of the physicians name would be extremely harmful to the physician
8530747 if there is serious reason to question the competence of this doctor the patients are entitled to know if it was their doctor and that they might wish to seek a second opinion
8530748 theyre claiming that there is a safety concern but its not named and its not explained that has led them to protect the identity of this particular doctor there is always a balance
8530749 but when you put on one side of the scale the potential health and safety of all this doctors patients i find it difficult to imagine what you would put on the other side of this scale that would justify not alerting patients to the danger that they may need to seek a second opinion
8530750 what we do is if its necessary the physician will withdraw from practice and at that point of course its obvious and the physician isnt practising and so thats our ability to say that the public is no longer at risk
8530751 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8530752 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8530753 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8530754 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8530755 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8530756 this will have a substantial impact on the healthcare system decreasing the pressure as more cancers are prevented
8530757 we have the knowledge today to reduce the cancer burden worldwide in australia cancer survival has increased significantly over the past two decades with 58 per cent of men and 64 per cent of females surviving beyond 5 years of their cancer diagnoses
8530758 if we compare this to the period from 1982 1986 only 41 per cent of men and 53 per cent of women were surviving five years after their cancer diagnoses
8530759 seventy per cent of worldwide cancer deaths have occurred in low and middle income countries which belies the assumption often made that cancer is not a significant problem beyond affluent nations
8530760 ones decision to avoid smoking be sunsmart reduce alcohol intake eat a nutritionally balanced diet exercise regularly and participate in vaccination programs can significantly impact the cancer burden
8530761 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8530762 we have been waiting some time for this decision from the fda and we are pleased to finally receive our clia waiver the granting of the clia waiver is expected to greatly impact our relationship with our laboratory alliance as up until this point the lab alliance has been obtaining clia waived devices from another supplier now that our rapid tox device is clia waived they will be obtaining all of their urine based point of collection devices from abmc
8530763 clia waiver also allows us to complete our negotiations with several distributors who service the physician and hospital market we are anxious to be able to penetrate new markets with our products and this waiver opens the first door for us i expect to see an immediate impact on sales beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and ramping up throughout 2009
8530764 in spite of the problems and expenses related to this in 2007 our chief science officer martin gould and director of quality assurance and regulatory affairs richard reilly have completed this first waiver well under budget in 2008 we expect future waiver applications to be more cost effective and expedient due to their efforts
8530765 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors
8530766 the adjuvant use of gleevec if approved would represent an important advance in the ongoing post surgery management of gist
8530767 i was delighted with dirk kuyt his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8530768 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8530769 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8530770 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test the response was clear togetherness focus and efficiency
8530771 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8530772 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8530773 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8530774 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8530775 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8530776 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8530777 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8530778 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8530779 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first

8530783 this is the first study to show their parabens accumulation in human tissues it demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours it would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants
8530784 it is welcome additional information and we will want to examine the findings in detail

8530798 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8530799 during a scrutiny of our documents in 2004 we found that some all india licences had quoted order numbers from the lgs office upon checking with the lgs office we found that the licence holders names were missing from the records we reported the matter to the economic offences wing eow
8530800 it appears that all india licences were fraudulently issued and forged documents used
8530801 it is certain that some of our officers are involved in the scandal

8530817 this case is not about iraq and whether you support or oppose the war
8530818 obviously were concerned when tensions rise in that region and you know as our general policy weve always encouraged the governments of india and pakistan to negotiate their differences peacefully
8530819 the troops barged into houses misbehaved with the inhabitants and ransacked the belongings we when were peacefully sitting in a lane they also smashed the windows of all the mosques in the area

8530850 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief

8530862 sustainability means simply that we plan our actions and control our impacts on the environment in such ways that we dont deplete the quality and quantity of resources and services that the planet is capable of providing to us our neighbors and our grandchildren
8530863 a lot of people assume that it all came naturally that is so not the case
8530864 i had to work really hard at progressing musically after a while though i had a knack for it
8530865 it sounds lame but i got started with a battle of the bands
8530866 i originally entered it as a joke but ended up winning again as lame as it sounds that was actually one of the best paid gigs ive ever had because the door money was the award for first place but it definitely peaked my interest in pursuing music
8530867 i am like every musician out there though i dont want to be in any sort of category
8530868 as a musician i try to differ from the regular from the expected
8530869 i dont necessarily strive well under admiration and im lost when people praise me
8530870 avoid cheesy love songs even though those are the easiest things to write
8530871 i offered him my equipment because hes young and cant really afford it its a very expensive thing to do
8530872 word has to get out and hopefully the cd will help generate more gigs regionally
8530873 i think its just luck artists draw inspiration from things and im just waiting for that because im hoping my inspiration for lyrics will be really meaningful
8530874 i have thought about going to school for music but i am already a musician so it never fully made sense
8530875 higher education is definitely important but its something i can always go back to
8530876 its difficult to get into the larger places you have to be more well known than a coffee shop player

8530889 its bigger and a better atmosphere especially for us we seem to have more fans most of the time so it would be disappointing if it left there
8530890 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8530891 man its getting crazy out here people are almost giving their right arm to see this speech
8530892 i didnt even try too crazy no way i was getting one
8530893 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8530894 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8530895 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8530896 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8530897 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8530898 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8530899 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8530900 in the past three years weve made steady progress toward our stretch goals and will bring in the third record freshmen class in a row this fall
8530901 it makes a really positive first impression and is much more enticing
8530902 we used to bring in a new transfer class of 1 600 each year but now have dropped to 1 300 it is our intention and goal to once again bring in 1 600 new transfer students and we hope to do so by improving our communication with and service to both prospective and current transfer students
8530903 its actually a relief to not be in the middle of a riot right now

8530910 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
8530911 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8530912 as a christian for me as a christian its also a sacred union
8530913 equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
8530914 on weekday mornings he and i ofttimes said goodbye by making love

8530938 the nutrition assistants work with these individuals to make sure they receive the right meal at the right time our goal is to ensure every patient within the unit receives an individually tailored service
8530939 it was fantastic as it always is when children are taught how to be good at gardening at such a young age
8530940 it really is so important to teach children about nature and what is around them which is why we have held these sessions over the summer holidays
8530941 peter was fantastic and the children were really gripped by him there was not a murmur from them all they wanted to do was learn
8530942 with current global security conditions the situation on the ground and the role space technology plays in theater is constantly and rapidly evolving

8530944 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand

8530954 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8530955 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8530956 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8530957 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8530958 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8530959 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8530960 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8530961 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8530962 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
8530963 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8530964 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
8530965 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago

8530974 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors

8530976 this will have a substantial impact on the healthcare system decreasing the pressure as more cancers are prevented
8530977 we have the knowledge today to reduce the cancer burden worldwide in australia cancer survival has increased significantly over the past two decades with 58 per cent of men and 64 per cent of females surviving beyond 5 years of their cancer diagnoses
8530978 if we compare this to the period from 1982 1986 only 41 per cent of men and 53 per cent of women were surviving five years after their cancer diagnoses
8530979 seventy per cent of worldwide cancer deaths have occurred in low and middle income countries which belies the assumption often made that cancer is not a significant problem beyond affluent nations
8530980 ones decision to avoid smoking be sunsmart reduce alcohol intake eat a nutritionally balanced diet exercise regularly and participate in vaccination programs can significantly impact the cancer burden
8530981 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness

8530993 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8530994 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8530995 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8530996 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8530997 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8530998 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8530999 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8531000 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8531001 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8531002 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations

8531005 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8531006 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8531007 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8531008 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8531009 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8531010 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8531011 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8531012 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8531013 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8531014 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8531015 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8531016 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8531017 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8531018 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8531019 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8531020 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down

8531026 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8531027 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8531028 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8531029 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8531030 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8531031 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8531032 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8531033 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8531034 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8531035 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8531036 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8531037 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8531038 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8531039 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8531040 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8531041 people are losing their health care their pensions their jobs a lot of them are losing their homes
8531042 they want change they desperately need change but they just cant accept that voting for a black man named barack obama is the only way to make that change
8531043 we need to be open and honest about it not brush it under the rug not hide it in the closet
8531044 but barack obama would not be where he is today if not for legions of white voters as well as hispanic and african americans voters he started out in iowa which is 85 90 percent white so i dont buy that whites wont vote for barack obama because he is black
8531045 will be a problem probably not as large as we anticipate but a problem people will vote their pocketbook and health care needs rather than race in most cases
8531046 americans from all walks of life and his ability to reach across the lines that sometimes divide us will help him win here in michigan and lead our nation as president
8531047 democrats who are skeptical about obama are the same people who were skeptical about al gore and john kerry and who voted for bill clinton
8531048 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8531049 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8531050 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8531051 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8531052 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8531053 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8531054 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8531055 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8531056 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8531057 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8531058 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8531059 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8531060 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8531061 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8531062 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8531063 the next six months are going to tell the story
8531064 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8531065 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8531066 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8531067 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8531068 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8531069 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8531070 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8531071 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8531072 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8531073 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8531074 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8531075 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8531076 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8531077 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8531078 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8531079 i wish i had know this before we had three
8531080 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8531081 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8531082 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8531083 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8531084 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8531085 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8531086 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8531087 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8531088 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8531089 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8531090 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8531091 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8531092 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8531093 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8531094 raping everything in my path i am the demon king
8531095 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8531096 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8531097 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8531098 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8531099 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8531100 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8531101 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8531102 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8531103 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8531104 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8531105 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8531106 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8531107 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8531108 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8531109 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8531110 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8531111 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8531112 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8531113 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8531114 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8531115 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8531116 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8531117 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8531118 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8531119 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8531120 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8531121 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8531122 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8531123 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8531124 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8531125 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8531126 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8531127 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8531128 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8531129 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8531130 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8531131 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8531132 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8531133 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8531134 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8531135 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8531136 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8531137 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8531138 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8531139 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8531140 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8531141 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8531142 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8531143 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8531144 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8531145 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8531146 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8531147 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8531148 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8531149 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8531150 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8531151 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8531152 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8531153 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8531154 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8531155 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8531156 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8531157 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8531158 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8531159 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8531160 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8531161 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8531162 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8531163 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8531164 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8531165 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8531166 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8531167 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8531168 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8531169 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8531170 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8531171 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8531172 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8531173 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8531174 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8531175 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8531176 mommy when its easter and the easter bunny forgot your basket ill share my candy canes and jelly beans with you
8531177 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8531178 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8531179 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8531180 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8531181 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8531182 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8531183 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8531184 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8531185 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8531186 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8531187 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8531188 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8531189 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8531190 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8531191 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8531192 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8531193 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8531194 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8531195 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8531196 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8531197 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8531198 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8531199 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8531200 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8531201 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8531202 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8531203 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8531204 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8531205 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8531206 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

8531217 waiter rant thanks for the tip confessions of a cynical waiter
8531218 well most people side with the waiter i think to be honest
8531219 there is an unspoken i wont mess with you and you wont mess with my food you do remember mutually assured destruction
8531220 if you work in a busy place you do have to prioritize ill give you the benefit of the doubt if i dont know you but if you look at the menu and your eyes bulge at the prices bad sign if youre screaming at your husband bad sign i dont want to wait on children i know people who hate waiting on women for whatever reason i suggest you walk in smiling and laughing as it does to anyone else your body language does matter to us
8531221 there are i try to just get my job done to get my table their food the basics i agree no one wants to hear our story but it would be inhumane not to talk at all no
8531222 it means theyre not going to be honest a good waiter will have one dish that they pan there is a weak spot on every menu and it does help with your credibility to identify it ive had managers tell me to move the flounder because its going bad i wont is it my fault your chef ordered too much fish truth is if the meal is bad and its the kitchens fault i feel it in the tip
8531223 understood but everyone thinks a list of specials is a sign of a classy place two specials is fine more youll forget youll ask me if this is written down some place and the thing is ideally everything is special
8531224 i like the food network but people watch these shows and they think they know how a restaurant works now and i dont and ive worked in one for nine years
8531225 well remember that tips spelled backward is spit remember that be polite to us be a human being to us please dont order something thats not on the menu dont order sushi in an italian restaurant if its not on the menu we dont make it the chef is talented but its probably a guy named julio making your food really stick to the menu dont make your own damn food you didnt want to when you left the house thats probably why youre here

8531240 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8531241 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8531242 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

8531268 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8531269 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types

8531271 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8531272 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8531273 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908

8531284 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8531285 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8531286 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8531287 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8531288 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8531289 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8531358 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8531359 it is not serious but we need to do it now
8531360 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 per cent fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8531361 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8531362 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match wednesdays 1 0 champions league win over standard liege with the pain
8531363 this is the time when adults are looking for a hideaway
8531364 and a comedy club is a place where they go and hide now that the kids are in school
8531365 there was one tree he took out that was completely uprooted and it wasnt a small kind of tree
8531366 we are outraged that such fundamental aspects of the food crisis were nowhere on the agenda for the summit
8531367 we are concerned that this summit will only reinforce corporate control of the food system and lead to a further destruction of the way of life of indigenous peoples and their survival
8531368 it is time for indigenous people and other food producers to take charge of food policy
8531369 towards food sovereignty is an online book with linked video and audio files the first three chapters available here begin to describe the ecological basis of food and agriculture the social and environmental costs of modern food systems and the policy reversals needed to democratize food systems the video and audio clips show farmers indigenous peoples and consumers all working to promote food sovereignty it highlights the importance of locally controlled food systems to sustain both people and nature
8531370 it is clear that aggressive promotion of hybrid rice is not based on its yield potential as it is often claimed but purely geared to create a hybrid seed market controlled by a few companies
8531371 hybrid seed companies supported by a few ngos are literally dictating the ministry of agriculture
8531372 the farmers have found that these so called high yielding varieties are actually giving a harvest much less than the conventional ones
8531373 tall claims on yield potential made by the companies have not translated on the fields
8531374 hybrid rice was quite popular in punjab at one time we sold 40 to 50 quintals of hybrid rice seed each year however over the last few years claims of a yield of 35 to 40 quintal per hectare have fallen flat
8531375 we sell the monsanto varieties of hybrid rice seeds and going by the response from the farmers we will not be able to see more than 4 quintals of seed this season
8531376 the yield of hybrid rice is on a par with that of the normal varieties
8531377 so rather than buying the expensive hybrid seed that costs rs 200 per kg we prefer the pau 201 conventional variety that costs rs 20 per kg

8531380 significantly reducing the spread of transgenes of gm crop plants to conventional and organic crop plants and to wild and weedy relatives
8531381 bracs swelling economic clout and increasing monopolisation of bangladeshs development sector is causing concern in some ranks
8531382 there are accusations that brac is acting like a parallel state but one that is accountable to no one
8531383 a group of seed dealers and micro credit based ngos are active in the introduction of hybrid seeds and are taking advantage of the natural calamities and disadvantaged condition of the farmers these activities are totally unethical
8531384 due to irrigation for boro rice cultivation through extraction of underground water the water table has gone down there are arsenic problems in drinking water and desertification in the northern region of the country has been intensified
8531385 takes seeds of unique plant varieties away from the farmers and communities who originally created selected protected and shared those seeds and makes them inaccessible to them
8531386 food crisis forces malaysia into barter palm oil for rice
8531387 multinationals make billions in profit out of growing global food crisis
8531388 we are stocking rice so that people will have something to buy and eat during the lean months of july august
8531389 it looks likely that we might be sleep walking into a world in which blood flows metaphorically and at times actually due to mistakes over food policy
8531390 ultimately we have to side with food democracy over food control
8531391 i know chinese eat a lot of rice that is why i want to plant more rice and sell to them
8531392 with the hybrid rice project the locals are forced into a new culture of cash crop farming completely at odds with their traditional practices and food system to the locals rice can thus pose a real threat to their local crops and culture
8531393 every year png imports around 203 000 tonnes of rice worth k56 million us 21 279 832 this amount of rice can be grown here in png as there are large areas of arable land available and we are capable of producing up to 5 tonnes per hectare if these lands are being utilized

8531399 the depositor recognizes the right of the royal norwegian ministry of agriculture and food to refuse to accept samples for deposit or to terminate the deposit of samples already deposited if the samples constitute duplicates of materials already held in deposit in the svalbard global seed vault

8531410 fowl play the poultry industrys central role in the bird flu crisis
8531411 we find this difficult to understand given the poor performance of the hybrid rice program and the many issues that have been raised against it over the years
8531412 the package is no different from those that have turned us into the worlds biggest rice importer by subsidizing hybrid rice we are subsidizing big seed companies like sl agritech bayer and monsanto when we should be using that money to support our own rice farmers fields will actually make us dependent on private companies that are not accountable to the public
8531413 better earnings will allow rice farmers to expand their areas and also become millionaires
8531414 after successive bad harvests and lacking the funds to service their debts many farmers have been forced to sell their land in many instances to the same chinese business people who sold them the seeds fertilizers and pesticides
8531415 farmers who cannot afford to pay off their debts incurred from the now higher costs of growing hybrid rice often end up selling their land to the same chinese companies that sell the farming inputs the companies then frequently turn the land into commercial rice farms
8531416 the system there doesnt have any leverage over farmers so labour is not very efficient but we cant send chinese workers to plant there laos
8531417 they charge a lot for land rent and theres no irrigation infrastructure so we have to rely on the rainy season
8531418 it is not realistic to grow grains overseas particularly in africa or south america
8531419 there are so many people starving in africa can you ship the grains back to china
8531420 as soy no lo he celebrado todav a en el vestuario no he tomado ni una copa porque quise acordarme de todos los que han puesto su grano de arena para que el equipo consiguiera el pase a europa

8531433 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8531434 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play

8531436 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this
8531437 there will be a change or two from the team that played last week but having said that only one or two because thats all weve got harvey said
8531438 we may well this week only have two emergencies thats where its at its difficult
8531439 through 17 players being out what weve found is guys have been given opportunities to play in different positions and guys are getting better looks in different positions
8531440 with that has come some confidence and a different angle to the team and in turn we are getting a different outlook on that particular player too
8531441 its given a lot of young players opportunities where it wouldnt have done in the past i think if anything its going to benefit the club going forward
8531442 we havent got a lot to play for we havent for a number of weeks but weve still been managing to play quite good football harvey said
8531443 under no circumstances during this year have we lost the spring in our step theyve been resilient
8531444 its six months before you get to play again so its all of those reasons why we will give it our all in the final game
8531445 the police received a report from a member of hospital staff that a drunk male was in the patient room with a hand gun police officers arrived by which stage he had moved into a treatment room
8531446 the defendant was challenged by three officers who had their firearms drawn he was arrested and taken to strand road police station during his police interview he said he had bought the bb gun for his 13 year old son at the lammas fair in ballycastle earlier in the day
8531447 the imitation gun was in a box but after drinking eight pints of beer he made his way back to derry and went to altnagelvin hospital with the gun clearly visible tucked inside his waistband
8531448 the police accept that he was not waving the imitation firearm around in the hospital and they accept it was not his intention to be violent it is not a case of causing havoc in a hospital ward

8531458 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time
8531459 i was a little more prepared this year than last year to say the least
8531460 we found out about it and tried to treat it and it was the doctors opinion that it wouldnt get any better without a little bit of rest a long rest
8531461 hes a young man and hes got a back like mine
8531462 i started relying more on the two seamer got them to swing early a lot
8531463 i got through those two innings on not even 10 pitches each and it helped my pitch count for the rest of the game
8531464 the arm feels good im just not getting it done right now
8531465 those guys are great pitchers theres probably a little competition amongst ourselves
8531466 if id been looking at a left on lefty situation id have had one ready to face morneau to lead off the inning
8531467 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field
8531468 it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game
8531469 well just continue to work with jose about managing what he says and how he responds
8531470 i was actually in the toilet so i didnt see it
8531471 managers do have to use the restroom and i guess i picked a bad time to be in the restroom theres no sense on commenting on it
8531472 i understand who i am and the money that im making
8531473 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word he said trust me anybody would want to go there
8531474 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
8531475 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
8531476 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution
8531477 have a common interest in the preservation of the territorial integrity of the country and the maintenance of national uniqueness
8531478 it is especially sad that russia and georgia two orthodox countries
8531479 separatism is a terrible force which destroys the foundations of states and if it is given the chance to develop chaos will dominate the world
8531480 and if they all want political independence wars without end will begin
8531481 extremely dangerous for russia itself giving an impulse to the development of separatism in your country and in the future you will have many more problems than there are in georgia that is something that ought to be considered

8531486 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8531487 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8531488 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8531489 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8531490 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8531491 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8531492 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8531493 the new policy would let agents open preliminary terrorism investigations after mining public records and intelligence to build a profile of traits that taken together were deemed suspicious

8531503 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government

8531513 if behavioral psychology was handmaid to the horrors perpetrated at guant namo bay abu ghraib and cia transnational black sites what new nightmares are in store for humanity when advances in neuroscience complex computer algorithms and a secretive national security state enter stage far right
8531514 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
8531515 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
8531516 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
8531517 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
8531518 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

8531534 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
8531535 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
8531536 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
8531537 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
8531538 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused

8531546 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
8531547 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
8531548 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
8531549 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan

8531553 police say they had a hard time getting the 14 year old student under control friday especially because of his size hes almost 6 feet tall and weighs 230 pounds
8531554 there was a 14 year old kid who was hitting a 16 year old kid explained elkhart police lt

8531557 will this be the most clich ridden election season in history
8531558 the blank card seems to come up all the time
8531559 theres often a tendency especially now that reporters are always on deadline because of the internet to fall back into clich

8531570 the fact is that the taliban now has pretty good insight into where were picking up information and how were developing it into actionable intelligence

8531586 this is truly shocking its exactly the definition of a police state the police will have the details of a whole generation for so called crime prevention
8531587 it raises a lot of issues and we havent had a debate in parliament about it
8531588 an investigation of a crime toward or by the child
8531589 this is yet another revelation about the database state that is shocking but not surprising
8531590 the police have always been able to look into whatever they want but the information age changes the scale of that completely
8531591 parents should know that this is not for the protection of their children it could be used to prosecute them this is a serious step on from what little has been told to the public
8531592 the purpose of contactpoint is not crime detection it is to help improve services to children including safeguarding vulnerable children
8531593 to access contactpoint for the purposes of prevention or detection of crime or for the prosecution of offenders police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a case for disclosure

8531596 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money

8531599 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
8531600 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
8531601 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
8531602 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
8531603 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
8531604 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
8531605 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933

8531613 were here to nominate a candidate for president of the united states could you imagine what would happen if something happened and the police werent here
8531614 on one hand its very reassuring in terms of knowing that when we need a police presence its there
8531615 so for example if there were to be riots in town or god forbid a terrorist attack or other things that are security related its kind of like our own version of

8531655 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school

8531943 con los ojos fijados en el futuro y el esp ritu de unidad con la meta de la victoria con fe en nuestro partido y en nuestro pa s declaremos ahora mismo de forma conjunta con una sola voz que barack obama es nuestro candidato y ser nuestro presidente
8531944 todo lo que he aprendido en mis ocho a os como presidente y en el trabajo que he hecho desde entonces en am rica y en cualquier parte del mundo me ha convencido de que barack obama es el hombre ideal para desempe ar este cargo
8531945 y restaurar el liderazgo del pa s en el mundo
8531946 nosotros luchamos en una campa a en donde los republicanos me dijeron que era muy joven y muy inexperto para gobernar el pa s

8531952 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail

8531963 this is an important milestone towards securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger

8531972 parceque moi surtout jai peur que la terre s puise pendant que je suis encore vivant
8531973 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8531974 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8531975 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8531976 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8531977 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8531978 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8531979 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8531980 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8531981 it makes me sick that far too many of our children are locked into school environments where some adults have decided that they have little or no chance to succeed
8531982 shakespeare is all based on beats rhythm and rhyme all things that rappers deal with
8531983 sir ian came to engage with some of the young people they were quite impressed that someone like him took the time it was impressive for them to see him using shakespeare and they tried to see the links between it and what they do that was something that inspired them
8531984 i think what city gateway does is great but if ian mckellen had come to read shakespeare when i was in school i dont think it would have had much of an effect on me
8531985 when i listened to the specials i felt these guys feel the same way i do the frustration of growing up in a council flat i dont know if shakespeare knew anything about council flats
8531986 i think schools should be more active in installing recording studios or buying musical instruments so kids can be more hands on
8531987 this is an amazing resource and the facilities are astonishing
8531988 kids want something to do human beings want activity and if they cant find it within their family or their friends well here theyve got grown up friends i think neighbours like me have a responsibility to show an interest
8531989 if the hype around privacy gains more credibility more people will hit the private button there is a potential threat here to click through advertising
8531990 dac ar fi din nou alegeri n ar lua nici 10 la sut
8531991 the first three episodes start the dynamic of where we are all going

8531993 until i get my computer and start writing with more of the
8531994 whats a girl like you doing with a guy like him
8531995 we have asked for a date for sometime in the second week of september
8531996 the ipl had asked us to appear before the panel on august 30 but we have yet to complete a few formalities
8531997 the idea is to have a large pool of players we are here to select a few talented ones who will be trained and groomed at a two week camp in queensland
8531998 we are not here to randomly pick up kids we are looking for talent
8531999 the first is to ensure talented kids are trained quickly and properly to have access to high level cricket
8532000 the other agenda is to reach out to the community
8532001 the heat was coming more from the inside rather than the weather and at times i felt as if i would explode
8532002 it was a struggle out there but getting a half century was a boost and it helped me carry on
8532003 i think suresh raina batted very but we got out too quickly together we would have easily added another 20 or 30 runs had one of us stayed till the end
8532004 we didnt score too many runs in the last 10 overs and that was a negative in this game but overall im very happy with our performance
8532005 its essential to get wickets first up and i think zaheer khan and praveen kumar have handled the new ball very well
8532006 praveen didnt do too well in this match but then munaf patel stepped in
8532007 its good to the players backing each other and stepping in to shoulder responsibility when someone else fails
8532008 it has been the case with our batting as well and weve been fielding well too
8532009 the spinners get more purchase towards the latter part of the innings and when you lose wickets its always going to be tough
8532010 you cant take anything away from indias win they won the toss put the runs on the board and then put us under pressure by picking up those wickets
8532011 sanath jayasuriya got us off to a good start and it was good to see him coming to the party
8532012 a good start is something which we had lacked in previous matches he gave us that in this match but unfortunately we could not follow it up and could not get a good partnership going
8532013 in the end after losing all those wickets we finished 40 runs short which perhaps we could have got had we had wickets in hand
8532014 riconosciuto il valore della consultazione popolare del prossimo 5 ottobre e la legittimit del tar ad esprimersi il prossimo 8 ottobre dopo la sospensiva decretata lo scorso giugno
8532015 fino a queste date affermano i no base al dal molin non deve essere toccato nemmeno un filo derba se come hanno annunciato gli statunitensi le demolizioni degli edifici storici presenti allinterno dellarea inizieranno questo sar un atto di arroganza e di prevaricazione sulla citt e sul tar
8532016 una forzatura rappresenterebbe una dichiarazione di guerra a vicenza a cui avvertono noi risponderemo con la nostra creativit e la nostra determinazione
8532017 i noticed the difference from the first moment we turned up in scotland and did a fielding drill and straight away i noticed it was different
8532018 the energy the buzz the skill levels and the fitness of the guys was different which is not saying it was bad when i was in the squad before but there has been an increase in intensity definitely and its fantastic
8532019 i dont think it happens overnight but its down to a lot of hard work i havent been here for a while so i dont know what the talk has been like behind closed doors but i imagine the difference is down to hard work
8532020 its something i have always believed in that the harder you work in the end you will get what you deserve but its not just about hard work its about being clever with it working on specific skills that might make the difference in the game like hitting the stumps and things like that
8532021 having worked with peter at sussex he is very keen on making sure were fit energetic and are getting our skill levels up
8532022 the team also has to buy into it so the individuals also have to think this is going to make a difference and make us better its a team effort to make those decisions and get better
8532023 the message will be weve done nothing yet and thats quite important
8532024 its been a good two games but lets make it three lets be really consistent and put in another really good performance
8532025 the way weve done that so far is by working hard making sure all the boxes are ticked and turning up on the day and really giving it a good go
8532026 vse kar sem se nau il v osmih letih kot predsednik in kasneje me je prepri alo da je barack obama pripravljen na polo aj predsednika zda

8532028 there have been stages this summer where ive hit some good shots but i havent played that really long innings
8532029 thats what i am looking to do over the next few weeks and if i can play some really long innings for yorkshire it will also make a difference to the team

8532050 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8532051 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8532052 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8532053 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive

8532057 i heard he was coming and im thinking a nascar guy
8532058 but i thought he was great he drew great analogies between nascar and football he drew a lot of points we could identify with
8532059 the biggest thing is communication you have to be in touch with your teammates and know what they are doing without ever saying a word
8532060 i have to be in constant contact with the pit crew
8532061 he knows what it takes to win championships winning a championship in anything you do is extremely difficult at the highest level
8532062 he has what it takes to be special it takes a lot of people and you need a good support team
8532063 it started when i was a kid i like nascar a lot it is exciting people have a wrong perspective of it
8532064 we want to win more this year that is what they say to you in racing too

8532077 we needed the rest to try and get healthy but now were antsy to get going again
8532078 laura harper and crystal kelly missed all of training camp theyve been trying to learn things on the fly but this gave us a chance to really work with our rookies
8532079 we played eight games in 15 days its more intense than the nba or the wnba
8532080 plus its a 15 hour time difference im wide awake at 4 a m in the afternoon im asleep on my feet but thats something you have to deal with im trying to give my body a chance to recuperate but weve got to get it together fast
8532081 it gave us a chance to reorganize and get some of our role players to really break down our offense

8532083 we needed the rest to try and get healthy but now were antsy to get going again

8532114 basically anyone who was not able to secure a spot in a hotel within downtown denver is forced to take a lengthy trip into the city for events every morning and out of the city from events every evening

8532118 i am mindful that only yesterday in birmingham ala our children crying out for brotherhood were answered with fire hoses snarling dogs and even death i am mindful that only yesterday in philadelphia miss young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered
8532119 given the virtual absence of substantive differences between the two democratic rivals its difficult to imagine these core supporters not voting for obama when push comes to shove if it turns out that more than a handful of them dont clinton style feminism will be exposed as an absurdity as opposed to something thats badly out of date
8532120 these cds lack warm tones and depth and i still resented this forced move until i heard the jose carreras placido domingo and luciano pavarotti concert album it is a powerful all digital dream conducted by zubin mehta and recorded in july 1990 under a full moon at the ancient baths of caracalla in rome its a tenor blitzkrieg a vocal wonder sharp crisp and heavy on high end operatic latin schmaltz in short its my kind of record there was something else i actually liked about the cd player i could load five discs onto it same as i could on my parents living room record player

8532164 theres about 600 bcf left on the field and if that staysthe same itll be about a 20 percent increase thats thenumber it will get to at a minimum

8532189 i signed my ballot this morning for senator obama but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice
8532190 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8532191 because we were on the right side of history and it won t work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8532192 more than a paycheck its dignity its respect its about whether you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be ok
8532193 on the most important national security issues of our times john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8532194 president bill clinton who reminded us what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first

8532244 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8532245 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8532246 violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia

8532252 we have a little girl who wants to play with our dogs constantly she crawls in their cage and rubs their belly we call our grandson crocodile guy because he likes to get them down and pry open their mouths the dogs are totally sweet
8532253 the dog gently nudges my hand licks my fingers and though we met only a couple of hours ago he obeys my every command all the while his vibrant eyes beam up at me dancing with loyalty and love an absolute angel and then bless his heart when i point to that young woman across the room he rushes toward her and tries to rip her arm from its socket with a ferocity forged in the fires of hell the angel is a devil dog too

8532262 veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8532263 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8532264 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8532265 our country is less secure and more isolated than it has been at any time in recent history
8532266 still embraces the extreme ideology that has defined his party for 40 years
8532267 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8532268 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8532269 again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obama is right
8532270 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8532271 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one
8532272 that leader is john mccain we need a leader who understands that you dont vote against funding for troops in harms way we need a leader who supports victory in iraq and doesnt try to legislate failure
8532273 i very much appreciated the comparison of his campaign to that of the current obama campaign pointing out that republicans said he was too young and inexperienced and he led us to our greatest era of prosperity and world security
8532274 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8532275 i guess from being in high school and i was able to actually talk to a teacher if i had an issue it was more of a one on one type situation
8532276 going from that to working online where i didnt have a teacher and if i did have a question i had to post a question for that day it was kind of hard in the sense where i didnt have people who were in the class with me to help me out
8532277 i was still able to adjust fine and just roll with the punches
8532278 it was something different that i had to get used to
8532279 but being in a war zone and juggling college that wasnt easy
8532280 it was a decision i knew i had to make
8532281 i was in a war zone knowing that people were trying to hurt us
8532282 i was always calling her and telling her hey look into going back to school
8532283 there were times when i was telling her go to school go to school
8532284 i would advise any army wife go ahead and go
8532285 it was hard one minute i was in a hostile environment and then i was home
8532286 i was in disbelief that i had made it home for a second time
8532287 theyre going to have to give me back my permits
8532288 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8532289 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8532290 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8532291 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8532292 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you
8532293 we were able to flip the cell from one state into another
8532294 any case where theres a cell type missing and there are neighboring cells that are still healthy
8532295 you wouldnt be transplanting cells so you wouldnt be dealing with immune issues
8532296 we just asked sort of like an undergraduate the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning
8532297 i feel vindicated i feel great that i am back

8532302 its such a neat property they are doing their best to keep up with it but need some overall guidance
8532303 its not the same as it was when george was there
8532304 now it has to be approached differently depending on what they want to do
8532305 shes one of the most creative people ive met in a long time
8532306 ich will unterhalten und das publikum dabei auch zum nachdenken anregen

8532308 ich bin kein gro artiger regisseur ich bin ein guter regisseur
8532309 talked very clearly about how john mccain was disconnected from our american people
8532310 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy
8532311 for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8532312 the loss of the middle class in america is something that has been happening for the last seven years and we have to repair
8532313 im greatly concerned that these women dont realize that in campaigns you win some and you lose some
8532314 this should not be an arizona tucson or umc issue im sorry that the federal reimbursement is going to go away
8532315 were never going to turn away somebody who needs care
8532316 the border patrol will never say they are their patients
8532317 if the patients are under arrest the border patrol has to pay for them
8532318 the arizona mexico commission serves as developing linkages and friendships when you need to work on the transfer piece
8532319 we particularly in our hospital here have developed a relationship with hospital general across the border
8532320 i think it would be helpful if there was a methodology and agreement developed between mexico and the united states on how patients would be transferred
8532321 it would be nice to say lets develop a system at this point everyone is doing the best they can

8532345 mr barnett plans to subsidise the price of gas to allow gas fired power plants to compete with our coal power station with taxpayers money yet gives no concessions to the coal industry
8532346 this is not a level playing field and will cripple the industry
8532347 the labor government has not built a new coal fired power station
8532348 the state needs a balance between coal and gas supplied energy

8532367 de uci heeft onze kandidatuur aanvaard nu is het wachten op hun definitieve beslissing als wij de licentie krijgen komt er volgend jaar opnieuw een eneco tour door belgi en nederland
8532368 volgens de regels kan de uci alleen een licentie verstrekken aan de eigenaar van een evenement en dat zijn wij
8532369 ik heb van mulukom niet opgezocht ik had geen zin in een confrontatie ik weet dat hij heel fel voor zijn zaak opkomt dat is zijn goed recht maar ik heb een andere stijl van leidinggeven ik zoek altijd naar oplossingen
8532370 wij hebben een koele relatie dat is normaal in een huwelijk dat niet meer werkt maar de dingen die geregeld moesten worden zijn geregeld je moet wel professioneel blijven
8532371 ook als we geen licentie krijgen gaan we door met een benelux ronde ik heb de uci niet nodig om een wedstrijd te organiseren
8532372 ik wil voorkomen dat we weer veel geld betalen voor een pro tour licentie en er niks voor terugkrijgen ik vond het deelnemersveld van de voorbije eneco tour ondermaats
8532373 hij zal de zittingen gewoon bijwonen maar artsen zullen wel extra op zijn conditie letten
8532374 vanaf vandaag zal duidelijk worden welke lijn de verdediging gaat voeren
8532375 daar ga ik nu buiten de rechtszaal nog niets over zeggen
8532376 we hopen voor het beste maar bereiden ons voor op het slechtste
8532377 asean india trade accounts for only 2 of aseans global trade so the potential of bilateral economic cooperation is profound
8532378 te jong en onervaren dat zeiden ze van mij ook
8532379 zestien jaar geleden verleenden jullie me de grote eer onze partij naar de overwinning te leiden samen overwonnen we in een campagne waarin de republikeinen zeiden dat ik te jong was en te onervaren om opperbevelhebber te zijn klinkt dat bekend het werkte niet in 1992 omdat we aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis stonden het zal niet werken in 2008 omdat barack obama aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis staat
8532380 with the dynamism of this economy which could pretty much double over the next seven to eight years and the fact that we have 450 million indians under the age of 25 who have a huge demand for sport the opportunities are as big as ones imagination
8532381 we zijn goed voorbereid dit evenement ingestapt de grote markt is slechts berekend op 15 000 mensen dat staat vast omdat er dinsdagavond al heel snel een enorme toeloop van mensen was hebben wij al vroeg de toegangswegen tot de grote markt afgesloten we hadden op een grote groep mensen gerekend maar niet z veel
8532382 hierdoor is de situatie gelukkig niet ge scaleerd bij elk groot muziekfestival vallen er mensen flauw omdat ze vooraan bij de dranghekken in de verdrukking komen omdat ze graag hun idool van dichtbij willen zien maar de hulpdiensten konden overal bij
8532383 het aantal bezoekers is bij zon evenement niet in te schatten
8532384 de combinatie van goed weer de introductieweek van de studenten en het einde van de vakantie zal er wellicht aan hebben bijgedragen dat het extra druk was
8532385 we vinden het heel vervelend dat er mensen onwel zijn geworden of teleurgesteld zijn maar laten we alles wel in proportie blijven bekijken bij zon overweldigende opkomst is dat onvermijdelijk
8532386 maar we bleven in onszelf geloven en het was uiteindelijk een goede prestatie we wilden per s in de champions league spelen
8532387 het is hier soms regen regen en nog eens regen
8532388 er zijn banken die zeggen dat ze de grootste problemen nu wel achter de rug zijn ze denken nu dat ze aan het einde van de lijdensweg zijn dat denken wij niet
8532389 kijk maar naar wat er nu gaande is in de verenigde staten volgens de laatste mij bekende telling worden daar nu 113 banken ondersteund door de staat maar de staat kan niet eindeloos blijven bijspringen er komt een keer een einde aan en dan zullen er banken gaan omvallen de kredietcrisis is nog niet voorbij
8532390 rabobank houdt sowieso niet zo van avontuurtjes als je wilt zou je je in de vs nu lam kunnen kopen voor een appel en een ei maar ook al biedt de crisis kansen er kleven nu nog allerlei risicos aan en wij blijven liever voorzichtig
8532391 de consument gaat zeker minder besteden wij denken dat in 2009 de groei van de bestedingen zal inzakken van de voorspelde 1 5 procent nu naar 0 5 procent volgend jaar
8532392 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8532393 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8532394 we see the slowdown in the u s market as a fundamental change
8532395 ich habe gut gespielt und bin wirklich sehr zufrieden mit meiner leistung
8532396 das war die beste anlage mit den besten und schnellsten gr ns auf der ich in den letzten drei jahren gespielt habe
8532397 barry ofarrell has today put political point scoring ahead of the states future he said
8532398 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8532399 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8532400 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8532401 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8532402 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8532403 era un hecho que uno de ellos se vendr a para ourense dado que el aumento del n mero de casos en los ltimos a os seg n los datos facilitados por el partido popular se sit a en el 550 desde 2005
8532404 uno por el propio aumento siendo la tercera ciudad de galicia con mayor n mero de casos y por otro lado por el colapso que sufrimos en estos momentos en el juzgado que lo lleva el de instrucci n n mero tres que tiene que resolver tanto asuntos civiles como los de violencia de g nero que tienen mayor prioridad
8532405 arrastramos un retraso de casi dos mil casos y los funcionarios no dan abasto
8532406 sab amos desde principios del mes de agosto que la posibilidad de que uno de los dos juzgados espec ficos fuera para ourense estaba muy atada
8532407 esta noticia sin duda est claro que en vez de ser la tercera ciudad de galicia en materia de justicia somos tercermundistas
8532408 todo lo que hemos conseguido fue a base de protestas y protestas
8532409 antes ten amos en ese mbito al juez jaime parra que con su trabajo consigui que esto no se viniera abajo
8532410 no s qui n querr venir a ocupar su puesto si tienen que llevar tanto violencia de g nero como asuntos civiles
8532411 es que hay tres partes presidencia el consejo general del poder judicial y el propio ministerio de justicia y cuando un barco lo llevan tres capitanes malamente funciona
8532412 ourense en materia judicial vuelve nuevamente a ser un cero
8532413 adem s queda claro que no hay ning n tipo de inter s por parte de la xunta y aqu se ve como los propios conselleiros ourensanos no hacen nada por la provincia y lo que no se puede es prometer algo y despu s no cumplirlo
8532414 no es s lo el tema del juzgado es que en ourense no se consigue dar cobertura a las bajas de larga duraci n del personal por lo que los funcionarios no dan hecho
8532415 las siete capitales deber n de tener un juzgado propio espec fico en esta materia pero deber an ser todos juntos y no cada a o uno o dos
8532416 la situaci n se sostiene gracias a los grandes profesionales que tenemos
8532417 aunque s existe este informe en el que aparecen pontevedra y santiago con mayor n mero de denuncias lo cierto es que esa no va a ser condici n indispensable para que ourense se quede sin juzgado de violencia de g nero ya que se tendr n en cuenta otras cosas
8532418 tiene como objetivo el cambio unilateral de las fronteras de georgia
8532419 la ue condena firmemente la decisi n unilateral de rusia de reconocer la independencia de esos dos territorios
8532420 juntos podemos construir un futuro de paz y de prosperidad
8532421 nosotros no queremos otra guerra fr a y el presidente de rusia tiene la responsabilidad de no desatarla
8532422 la mayor coalici n posible contra la agresi n rusa en georgia
8532423 debemos revisar la naturaleza profundidad y amplitud de nuestras relaciones con rusia
8532424 te jong en onervaren dat zeiden ze van mij ook
8532425 zestien jaar geleden verleenden jullie me de grote eer onze partij naar de overwinning te leiden samen overwonnen we in een campagne waarin de republikeinen zeiden dat ik te jong was en te onervaren om opperbevelhebber te zijn klinkt dat bekend het werkte niet in 1992 omdat we aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis stonden het zal niet werken in 2008 omdat barack obama aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis staat
8532426 the biggest question i get is has the dollar embarked on a seven year uptrend
8532427 existen sujetos que bien podr an darle cobijo al pr fugo
8532428 a la vista de los resultados tremendamente negativos que supon a el medtec incluso de enfrentamiento entre los profesionales
8532429 siempre hemos defendido que todas las unidades cl nicas se integren en el sergas tener un sistema de gesti n p blico universal no varios modelos con p blica y privada
8532430 suponemos que ahora galaria la nueva empresa p blica que crear sanidade se encargar de valorar la tecnolog a que se adquiere como antes hac a medtec en unidades de alta tecnolog a como medicina nuclear
8532431 era una amenaza al desarrollo de estas especialidades en el sistema p blico c mo vas a favorecer a una empresa privada dentro del hospital y con capital p blico
8532432 los m dicos lo ve amos as y por eso aplaudimos el compromiso de la xunta
8532433 una asignatura pendiente que servir para acercar un servicio a la gente que antes parec a destinado para unos pocos
8532434 es una decisi n muy positiva porque cuando algo se privatiza se pierde la calidad ya que lo nico que interesa son los criterios econ micos
8532435 si hay algo que nos tiene que servir de referencia del mectec es el amplio horario que ofrec an tanto de ma ana como de tarde e incluso algunas noches
8532436 siempre que hay asuntos entre emigrantes y poblaciones residentes a la larga pueden traer problemas

8532450 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation

8532455 first of all its cibcs first profit in three quarters
8532456 its a lot of relief on the fact that it looks like they have written down almost everything they had to write down you can assume maybe i hope that the worst is perhaps behind cibc now and they can move on and get into a profitable business
8532457 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8532458 is unique because of the unilateral power held by the justice department under the consent decree into which raycom had previously entered
8532459 benefited from our business system and geographic diversity which mitigated the impact of sharp increases in raw material and other input costs

8532578 he liked riding his horse and training dogs the most
8532579 he stayed active and was riding and working until he started not feeling well in july
8532580 everyone had to scratch and claw for everything they got back then
8532581 that made him not afraid to work hard and gave him the drive to succeed
8532582 he had a work jacket with a broken zipper that he kept closed with a rope
8532583 i told him we should get him a new jacket but he said no no the rope worked just fine thats the way his generation was

8532589 i tell young athletes all the time that if you want to become a champion you need to stay focused train hard and pay attention to what you eat
8532590 im so thrilled for all of our athletes but in particular to see nastia take the gold in the all around and now get her own wheaties box
8532591 wheaties is arguably the first and still one of the foremost brand images in all of sports its an honor for any athlete to be on the box and more than anything it epitomizes what it means to be a true champion
8532592 having your picture on the wheaties box is something all athletes strive for

8532602 i am thrilled to pave the way for california drivers to obtain insurance that is more environmentally friendly and more accurately reflects driving habits
8532603 as a strong advocate of healthy market competition and a healthy environment i am especially pleased to encourage this kind of innovation and additional options for consumers
8532604 in concept this is something we think is a good approach
8532605 a drivers mileage will lower auto insurance premiums particularly when the high cost of gasoline is encouraging people to drive less
8532606 in abercromby street where my practice is the average male life expectancy is about 53 years old
8532607 there is a high incidence of mental illness like depression which leads to a number of organic problems
8532608 its not surprising that we see more cases of heart disease stroke diabetes asthma and bronchitis than areas like lenzie
8532609 one of the postal sectors here has the lowest income in the uk
8532610 that means people have less money to spend on basics like food clothes and travel to work
8532611 this is made worse by other social problems like poor housing and community safety
8532612 the area also has serious problems with gang and knife culture and of course drug and alcohol abuse which are colossal contributors to early death
8532613 over the last two or three years weve had more and more patients asking for help to stop smoking
8532614 thats great and we do all we can to help but there are other things which government can do
8532615 in recent times we have dealt with advertising of cigarettes and then with smoking in public places
8532616 but i believe that advertising for alcohol and junk food should also be tackled
8532617 this suggests the credit crunch is not having a profoundly adverse impact on capital spending that most economists myself included assumed it would

8532635 this is in spite of the fact that we reduced the number of issues for cfo magazine to 11 in 2008
8532636 our web sales are gaining traction especially with webcasts and other sponsorships and our research business is on track for a record year as with other conference producers cfo is experiencing some negative impact due to the economy and increased fuel prices but overall our franchise is performing well in stormy seas
8532637 we are not immune to the pressures of downward economic cycles and do expect increased headwinds as the year advances yet we continue to uncover sales opportunities as advertisers and sponsors appreciate the value of our decision making audience
8532638 weve got some interesting programs in the pipeline and anticipate creating more client specific programs leveraging our content expertise in such critical topics as international financial reporting standards xbrl and fair value accounting in addition our technology advertisers are continuing to invest in the cfo brand

8532682 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8532683 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8532684 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8532685 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8532686 e j s a great player and hes got tremendous ability
8532687 it doesnt bother me im just thankful for the opportunity

8532689 it was just getting the chance to play against the best players around
8532690 ive always been competitive like that i wanted to see if i could do it i had no idea coming from a 1a school
8532691 i was playing against schools like mater dei and long beach poly so i dont know why
8532692 there are some things that have taken place that are very promising
8532693 things are happening in front of him and he can choose the right window
8532694 hes a real smart guy hes real calm on the field its good to have him there im real energetic real excited and hes real calm and hes always thinking he always knows whats going on
8532695 when i came here i didnt really know what to expect
8532696 i did have a lot of confidence in myself as a player and then after a while being here you get to realize what it takes and i definitely felt like i had what it takes i guess in that sense im not surprised just grateful for my opportunities and that it gives me a chance to show what i can do

8532745 i thought joining would be a great way to meet other women with the same goals and ambitions as i had
8532746 but all you have to be now is a woman in the quaker valley school district who has a desire to serve
8532747 i expect team leadership thats what im looking for the senior leadership and intangibles that make or break a season anthony has experience a year and a half under his belt he has speed hes added strength in the offseason
8532748 once his hand is completely healed i expect nothing but the best from him and for him to lead this football team as far as we can go
8532749 those two guys give us a good one two punch
8532750 chad does have strength but he also has good vision and accelerates to the hole real well i expect him to be a big force of our offense especially if josh is down
8532751 its a wide open field and the kids are busting their rear ends
8532752 right now were looking to replace corners and wide receivers two of the areas you have to be good at to win football games were still searching to find the right combination there
8532753 this is the first year in a long time that weve had this many returning linemen
8532754 weve been together since eighth grade we have a bunch of starters coming back
8532755 hes bigger and stronger he runs to the ball real well
8532756 one thing thats going to help is that last year a lot of juniors started so we got a lot of experience
8532757 if we can stay away from injuries the sky is the limit
8532758 this team has so much potential from the starting line to the defense to the tight ends and wide receivers everything on offense and then the defense at franklin regional has a tradition of stopping teams
8532759 i was a grown person before i was able to sit anywhere in the theater
8532760 one of the great things about this book is that its got a lot of people in it and we named most of them
8532761 so people can look through the book and put faces to names and really know the people who came before them
8532762 i went to mrs cole to get her approval to see if i could even consider something like that
8532763 in her files and archives she has it all it just needed to be compiled in this format
8532764 what i love about the history is the cohesiveness of the community that existed in the photos
8532765 you can see how people were a real strong oriented community they were like family
8532766 i love how they found resources within themselves they were denied and limited by the social standards of those days
8532767 although we speak about those memories and segregation this book has no negative spirit about it
8532768 what i want for my kids is to appreciate people who came before them to appreciate their own ancestors and the lives they lived and learn from it
8532769 school just started and people are returning from vacations its a fabulous way to start fall in sewickley
8532770 they are very creative with their items and it is always so neat to see what theyve brought
8532771 many of the businesses really do get into the spirit of harvest festival and participate in the sidewalk sale
8532772 its great seeing all of them open with so many people in town that day
8532773 theres always a lot of new people in town that day and we always want to see them come up to the businesses and see whats going on
8532774 so id imagine people will be coming and going all day long
8532775 theyre not all from sewickley and thats very nice to see that so many others want to come here to see whats going on
8532776 their employees get dressed up like clowns and fortune tellers and story tellers and they have face painting
8532777 they get the kids involved with their activities theyre really terrific its a great part of the festival
8532778 the fire department will have an open house for everyone to see their new truck
8532779 the two groups got together and thought it would be a great service project to raise money for our groups
8532780 everyone comes out for this great event to see whats for sale and get something great to eat
8532781 what better way to go from summer to fall is there
8532782 as with every year its about a great group of kids coming together and working hard
8532783 last years team was filled with guys who were selfless and team oriented they were a pretty tight knit group
8532784 were going to be very young and the returning guys are going to have to step up and provide the same type of leadership last years team had all of those kids coming back have worked hard in practice hopefully it will filter down to the younger guys
8532785 its the start of a new year so all that stuff is behind us
8532786 we are a young team and we have our own goals obviously we want to go back and do it again but we still have a lot of work ahead of us
8532787 his work ethic has remained strong his leadership is key for this team
8532788 even though nolans a first year starter youll see some good things from him
8532789 i like the challenge for our team were proud to be back in the quad east
8532790 i can do everything now that ive wanted to do for the past nine years
8532791 im excited to be working with the students parents and teachers this year as the principal
8532792 were trying to get our students to have the best educational experiences we can find for them
8532793 these programs are a way for us to get the word out about st james to other schools
8532794 i keep class photos and other great keepsake items here its the same way parents keep a few memorable projects their kids designed in school
8532795 i care about the students here and want them to succeed
8532796 many of the students here have been students of mine in the past and i will continue to interact with all of them as their principal
8532797 we have a great school and the support of loving caring families
8532798 as good as terrelle was we had a lot of good kids around him
8532799 we might not have the home run hitter like terrelle but we do have guys who can go the distance
8532800 we had a lot of kids last year who played well
8532801 there are a lot of good coaches in this league
8532802 our expectations are just to compete in the first scrimmage
8532803 goal wise we want to get better every week we want to get more depth and we want to play week by week only concentrating on that game
8532804 hopefully we can end up in the last game of the season head to head with jeannette both being undefeated
8532805 every year you never know whos going to be there
8532806 every week you better not play poorly because someone will beat you last year mcguffey took it to us
8532807 we have almost all of our linebackers back we thought the defense would be the strength of the team
8532808 nick is definitely someone you build that around he is very intelligent he doesnt make any mistakes very physical he plays hard every down
8532809 we each play our own positions we dont try to do too much we work well as a unit
8532810 all four of us are pretty good weight room kids which gives us the strength to take on blocks
8532811 hes going to do a little bit of running and passing hes 6 5 215 so he better be able to run
8532812 after what he did this summer i know he can throw the ball he was absolutely amazing and now notre dame is recruiting him
8532813 he can play tailback he can play slot back hes got great hands
8532814 hes one of those kids who can help you just about everywhere
8532815 theyre just young im anxious to see how well they do
8532816 i think we should probably try to really focus on the name change since a lot of people worked very hard to get it changed
8532817 we should have the designs finished within the next few weeks
8532818 the interstate conference is the toughest conference in aa i dont care what beaver county says
8532819 there isnt an easy game theres no such thing as an off week in this conference
8532820 he brings a lot of things hes an exceptional talent he brings leadership on the field and off hes a guy the rest of the team looks to for guidance on the field
8532821 he would like to surpass what he did last season hes going to be the kid that teams are going to be shooting for every week
8532822 we feel good weve got a young team but we feel like we can accomplish some goals
8532823 i expect some good things i definitely think we can go far we should definitely be down at heinz
8532824 hes got nice mechanics nice speed he runs well since we run the spread depending on what he reads hell be keeping the ball a lot
8532825 thats a good look it takes the pressure off me when morris can run the ball a couple of times it opens the gates for me
8532826 were very young up front were running the spread offense you dont have to be overpowering on the line
8532827 you just have to be quick and seal thats a benefit for us weve got nice speed on the line
8532828 last year because we were scoring so many points a lot of people didnt notice how good our defense was
8532829 our defense was the strength for us last year and they will be again for us this year they are aggressive they attack the ball
8532830 special teams is critical its obviously a very critical part of the game that kind of gets overlooked
8532831 its certainly one third of the game last year we had a couple games where it decided the outcome of it and unfortunately it wasnt good outcomes for us
8532832 i took over special teams the last couple years when the head coach takes it over the kids realize how important it is they know im demanding
8532833 special teams has become very intricate to where we have four or five punts and formations two or three kickoff returns and two or three kickoffs besides onside and squib
8532834 one of the biggest ways to start a game or a half or just change the momentum is with special teams thats where the biggest hits happen and its also one of the best chances for big plays
8532835 my position is only as good as the offense that gets us down the field its all about the teamwork on the special teams
8532836 i can only get the kick off if the long snapper gets it back straight and on time the holder puts it down and the line holds
8532837 kicker is as important as any position on the field its just as important as quarterback receiver offensive lineman
8532838 you saw how important it can be at the gateway game last year we lost that game because of special teams
8532839 i tell myself its just a backyard football game nothing more nothing less
8532840 i learned last year that if you miss one you have to forget about it you have to have a short memory as a kicker
8532841 definitely when youre coming down to the end of the game and its tied with your team driving you get a feeling in your stomach
8532842 thats my job though when they call upon me whether it be an extra point or field goal theres no excuses i just have to put it through
8532843 i see it as a job i have to go and do kick one forget about it go to the next one
8532844 my mentality is different than last year its a job now they expect this out of me i feel more relaxed and a lot different than last year
8532845 the no 1 thing that it takes is heart and desire thats what special teams is about
8532846 its about the heart to go down there and make a play the desire to do it and the discipline to react to situations
8532847 theyll run down under kicks and do what theyre supposed to do
8532848 it gives kids a chance to play and get noticed sometimes its a big help to have kids that can come in and spell some of the starters
8532849 special teams is vital its important to work on it which we do
8532850 were really fast were not the biggest team but were really fast
8532851 that will be our advantage over other teams well be quick to the ball on defense and well be explosive on offense
8532852 i told them going in that whoever was quarterback the other was going to play wide receiver we might put matt back at quarterback and use mike brown at receiver
8532853 we have some flexibility there and next year matt could be the quarterback again
8532854 the one thing that helped brown out is that hes the point guard on the basketball team you have to make some decisions there
8532855 thats the same as playing quarterback where you have to make quick decisions
8532856 the big thing for us this year is to see if we can run the ball better
8532857 if we can do that i think that will help our passing game out as well
8532858 its a big improvement from last year were a lot bigger smarter and stronger
8532859 we like to throw the ball around ten times for us is low so well be up around the 20s we have some skill
8532860 i think the key will be if we can protect our quarterback thats always the key
8532861 we have to stop the run with the schedule weve had the past couple years theres been some mismatches
8532862 were not the biggest guys so we have to do some things to help us stop the run or at least contain the run
8532863 overall the competition in our section could make it the best section in the wpial
8532864 were trying to use that as a starting point last year our goal was getting to the playoffs this year our goal is to go as far in the playoffs as we can not just hope to get there but to expect to get there
8532865 thats what i want hempfield players to feel every time the season starts expect to win and expect to be in the playoffs
8532866 we want to do more than just make the playoffs we want to make a run at the conference title this year
8532867 our goal is to win the wpial championship and do some damage in the piaa playoffs
8532868 you really dont fill those shoes but ive asked every player on the team step their level of play up ive reminded them that every team that has ever won a super bowl has not had a full roster
8532869 theyve all had injuries to key players and had to elevate their level of play now thats what we have to do
8532870 each one brings something different to the table theyre all sophomores
8532871 every time they touch the ball theyre capable of putting points on the board that will continue
8532872 were going to move him all over the place and try to get the ball in his hands
8532873 we cant just count on r j and ryan to carry the load we have to spread that out
8532874 we still have a little bit of work to do but i think with a little bit of work and a little bit of positioning well be just fine
8532875 wed like to get back into the playoffs without having to finish the way we did last year
8532876 moon is obviously a great program and its a great game to start the year
8532877 this is the first season in three years that i will have more seniors and juniors on the team than sophomores and freshmen
8532878 the best thing ive seen out of the preseason is that were playing well as a team
8532879 i think the second half of last season has really motivated the team for this year
8532880 we did that with a lot of freshmen sophomores and juniors on the field and now theyre sophomores juniors and seniors they had that constant playoff pressure for six games last year and they responded
8532881 they were pretty upset when ashley went down but theyve been real supportive of her
8532882 were looking for our senior players to be leaders on the field not just the captains we also have some juniors that are going to be working in the same capacity
8532883 i think we have a great deal of potential if we play up to our ability level theres no reason why we shouldnt be able to win our section
8532884 we wanted to figure out a way to help her through this even if it was just gifts and cards
8532885 through that we had an idea to make something big happen
8532886 someone could be scheduled to pick up the kids up at school one day
8532887 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism
8532888 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with
8532889 lets declare together in one voice right here right now
8532890 i dont know if youll ever replace guys like mike shanahan mike salopek brad rodgers and tyler urban but we have guys who have worked extremely hard in the offseason to step in to carry on the tradition that they have set
8532891 i think with some time well gain some experience and youll see the benefits of that
8532892 thats what your senior year is all about those guys got some significant playing time last year
8532893 you cant coach experience hopefully they can take their experiences and pass it down like last years group did
8532894 thats our goal for alex and thats a personal goal that hes set for himself to become a leader and to take this team on his shoulders and run with it thats what were looking for
8532895 he has worked extremely hard this offseason and i think hes going to reap the benefits of his efforts
8532896 people dont really have high expectations for this team because we lost so many players but a lot of the young players are really coming along and playing well
8532897 they dont have much game experience but theyre ready to play theyre real talented
8532898 we had mike shanahan and mike salopek last year so no one knew about these kids but these kids are good they can play
8532899 alex has a division i arm we need to find some receivers that can replace the guys we lost last year
8532900 with a little time i think our experience will start to come through
8532901 the new linemen are looking good i wasnt sure since none of them have any varsity experience but theyre shaping up really well
8532902 i think our running game will be strong we have a lot of depth at our running back and fullback positions the linemen are really shaping up i think we can be dominant in the running game again this year
8532903 i think we can establish the running game offensively we do have some talent up front whether they can gel remains to be seen thats where we have to start
8532904 and we want to take advantage of some of the athletes we have we have a pretty solid group of athletes coming back who hopefully can blossom like the kids did last year
8532905 if youre not strong and fundamental up the middle youre going to pay for it we are going have our hands full trying to replace quite a few guys
8532906 i dont think ive been around a better linebacking corps than we had a year ago but weve got four guys who i know are going to stick their noses in there
8532907 they are two of the top teams in quad a year in and year out we played them both last year in very good football games unfortunately we were on the short end of both of them
8532908 both of them return an awful lot were certainly going to have our hands full with them
8532909 its for anyone who is looking for general wellness in all four areas
8532910 so anything spiritual is positive as far as im concerned and it helps with other challenges me and my husband have faced
8532911 my success at which so many stand amazed is because you are my mighty protector all day long ill praise and honor you oh god for all that you have done for me
8532912 this woman lost half her body weight and said she made the changes when she started to put god first in her life
8532913 its not limited to how many bananas you eat during the day
8532914 we wont bore you with a new muffin recipe every week
8532915 you ask yourself before you eat is it made with the healthiest ingredients and am i eating a reasonable portion
8532916 as a busy mom i like to be able to check off fellowship weight loss and bible study after just going to one meeting
8532917 members are encouraged to put god first in their lives and give him the power
8532918 there are other reasons why we eat that are emotional we eat to fill other voids in our lives and god can come in and heal those hurts
8532919 your students still use pencils and paper to take exams
8532920 dont tell me youre still using slide rules to teach arithmetic
8532921 an integrated digital notes organizer for todays high tech on the go students
8532922 held a virtually unlimited number each with a virtually unlimited number of pages
8532923 were going to be in the same offense we think eric is going to make tremendous progress from a year ago all his skill players around him are back from last years team as well as a number of starters on the offensive line
8532924 were hoping we can continue to make progress in this no huddle spread offense
8532925 it all starts with him we gave him a lot of decision making at the line of scrimmage in terms of which way we wanted the play called the protection the motions everything was on his shoulders at the line of scrimmage then we have some very good kids to catch the football as well
8532926 hes a very good runner and a very good passer he has gotten better in the off season in terms of his throwing mechanics
8532927 i think ryan laduke had a tremendous summer he played with a shoulder injury all last year
8532928 now hes injury free and has come back a better athlete i think hell have a tremendous year
8532929 we have nine or 10 offensive linemen that could get on the field we wont lose a step with any of them
8532930 hes the inside backer and makes the calls in the huddle
8532931 hes the kind of guy that takes care of everything in the middle of the field for us
8532932 being that were in a very competitive section and were one of the smallest schools in quad a football we want to make the playoffs
8532933 im happy to be here theres a wonderful feeling of peace
8532934 i knew i wanted to spend my life in the theater
8532935 all i cared about was writing and my son and i took care of them both

8532940 its exciting to have one of the best backfields back for this year
8532941 i am also very comfortable with the receivers we have been together awhile too
8532942 i dont have any personal goals i just want to show we belong here
8532943 we have a new line and i am confident they can play
8532944 i love to compete so i am excited about this season
8532945 we are about 6 foot 4 220 pounds across the front and our offensive coordinator john skiba is a great offensive line coach
8532946 i probably wont get the chance to kick that far in a game but its nice to know i can do it

8532953 they have been dedicated to the weight room and they are awfully big
8532954 theyve played a lot last year and theyve got some experience
8532955 they are dedicated and i think they want to win
8532956 i look for gailey to be a leader on the field
8532957 he never loafs and he always pushes the other guys basinger can be as good as anybody were moving him from right tackle to left tackle and he could be a division i player
8532958 ive always believed that you play good defense and you run the ball
8532959 i want to run the ball and were going to work like heck to run the ball weve got to consistently move people off the ball if we do that well be just fine
8532960 he is competitive and he should be a leader on the team
8532961 we should have a good secondary but some linebacker positions are open
8532962 last year when things went bad we didnt know how to stop it
8532963 we have to get through our exhibition games without being sloppy but all of our games will be fairly tough
8532964 i want our kids to play against the best and this will give our kids a good experience
8532965 i know these kids wont just drop their heads and give up
8532966 obviously the moneys available and you get a fantastic return when you invest in the security of public health here in the province
8532967 when you no longer have nine or 10 ceos and you have one theres an obvious cost savings there long term
8532968 but i want to emphasize that the changes were making in health care are not about cost savings theyre about providing a more efficient effective health care system
8532969 will be given a clear number of who got what
8532970 demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practise medicine and is suffering from an ailment that might if the physician were permitted to practise constitute a danger to the public
8532971 there may be times when there is someone involved in that process who would be harmed or embarrassed by the release of the name and or there may be times when the actual release of the physicians name would be extremely harmful to the physician
8532972 if there is serious reason to question the competence of this doctor the patients are entitled to know if it was their doctor and that they might wish to seek a second opinion
8532973 theyre claiming that there is a safety concern but its not named and its not explained that has led them to protect the identity of this particular doctor there is always a balance
8532974 but when you put on one side of the scale the potential health and safety of all this doctors patients i find it difficult to imagine what you would put on the other side of this scale that would justify not alerting patients to the danger that they may need to seek a second opinion
8532975 what we do is if its necessary the physician will withdraw from practice and at that point of course its obvious and the physician isnt practising and so thats our ability to say that the public is no longer at risk
8532976 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8532977 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8532978 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8532979 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8532980 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8532981 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8532982 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8532983 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8532984 conscient de l motion et des questionnements suscit s par cet incident

8532987 as i ramble through life whatever be my goal i will unfortunately always keep my eye upon the doughnut and not upon the whole
8532988 some authors may frown upon this and out of respect to them i will not post at this time
8532989 the resurgence of vinyl centers on a long standing debate over analog versus digital sound digital recordings capture samples of sound and place them very close together as a complete package that sounds nearly identical to continuous sound to many people analog recordings on most lps are continuous which produces a truer sound though paradoxically some new lp releases are being recorded and mixed digitally but delivered analog
8532990 a digital recording is not capturing the complete sound wave it is approximating it with a series of steps some sounds that have very quick transitions such as a drum beat or a trumpets tone will be distorted because they change too quickly for the sample rate in your home stereo the cd or dvd player takes this digital recording and converts it to an analog signal which is fed to your amplifier the amplifier then raises the voltage of the signal to a level powerful enough to drive your speaker a vinyl record has a groove carved into it that mirrors the original sounds waveform this means that no information is lost the output of a record player is analog it can be fed directly to your amplifier with no conversion this means that the waveforms from a vinyl recording can be much more accurate and that can be heard in the richness of the sound but there is a downside any specks of dust or damage to the disc can be heard as noise or static during quiet spots in songs this noise may be heard over the music digital recordings dont degrade over time and if the digital recording contains silence then there will be no noise
8532991 if anything from the first year to now we want to stay the course
8532992 last year we were teaching two new systems and you have no one to demonstrate it because the seniors dont know it this year we want to hit the ground running the guys know the system and they know what we expect of them
8532993 weve been repping the same plays over and over again we just keep running them until we get them perfect and well get there
8532994 weve been practicing all summer to get the plays down and now were just building on that
8532995 with the injuries weve had in camp a lot of the young guys have stepped in
8532996 theyre proven that if theyre given the opportunity well be alright
8532997 weve been short on running backs in camp but the freshmen underclassmen theyve been stepping up so thats good for us
8532998 neither one of those guys got a great deal of varsity snaps but because of the time theyve put in during the offseason it feels like theyre returning starters
8532999 eddies our big guy coming back from last year he knows the system and plays going downhill hes the leader of the defense and hes going to make a lot of tackles
8533000 weve got a young squad but theres a lot of teams like us in the new conference
8533001 i think could go about 5 4 and battle for the playoffs this year
8533002 we have junior matt johnson and sophomore bill emerick and the two have been fighting it out
8533003 my preliminary evaluation is that tarique might be the best overall athlete i have
8533004 and jackson who was successful in track in the 300 hurdles and the 4x100 relay has been working hard but brett has our most significant experience
8533005 we have no returning line starters on offense or defense
8533006 theyve bought into everything weve installed because we have to be ready to compete in one of the toughest conferences in the state on pennsylvania
8533007 but we do have two young inside linebackers who have looked really good luke mueller played some last year
8533008 we have a lot of things up in the air on defense
8533009 well see where we are after the scrimmage games to see if we have the right group
8533010 i dont know much about pine richland or shaler this year
8533011 microsofts just slapped together a pair of special edition zunes for both the republican and the democratic national conventions and they look pretty damn great
8533012 demonstrate the highest level of commitment to offsetting their carbon footprint from attending the convention
8533013 we want to get north hills back to where it has been
8533014 we want to win the conference and get past the second round of the playoffs
8533015 we have eight starters back on offense and our timing has been amazing
8533016 i have developed good timing with receivers lloyd phillips and max creighan lloyd is a nice deep threat and max will line up in the slot i have confidence in them and i know where they will be
8533017 justin is light years ahead of where he was last year
8533018 he is bigger physically and now he is working on the mental aspects of the game i expect an improved performance from him as he will be the leader of the offense
8533019 i have put on 10 pounds and i am stronger and faster than last year
8533020 i think our defensive line is strong and our secondary is experienced we are looking really good on defense
8533021 we have good team speed and the guys are working as a team
8533022 this is a senior led group and they are playing with a lot of enthusiasm
8533023 nick and dan both play with a big chip on their shoulder and both of them run well
8533024 i am happy with how we have come together as a team
8533025 mentally it helps so much to know that you can beat one of the really good teams
8533026 we had four players graduate from last year so today definitely helped us it gives us a boost of confidence
8533027 its definitely exciting i have a lot more responsibility now
8533028 im also a captain this year so i have to set an example and help motivate my teammates its going to be a very different role theres more obstacles but its exciting
8533029 i like the responsibility but i have to keep it up and keep playing hard to win my matches
8533030 it is a lot different from doubles but i like it
8533031 i think we can do a good job in the wpial tournament and win another title
8533032 its going to be hard to get to the state tournament in hershey again but if we do what we need to do well win and get back there
8533033 i think if everyone gets their points like they did today we could win wpials possibly get to hershey that would be a good goal just to get back there because it is a building year
8533034 right now its the very beginning we didnt even have our lineup set before today
8533035 shes had a very good summer and has improved a great deal from last year
8533036 shes been invited to some national tournaments and shes come into this season very very fit i think that will help her be a better player this season having played against national level competition
8533037 gabis such a solid player we have a guaranteed win with her usually because shes so consistent
8533038 its going to be a huge advantage having logan on the team shes a good player and she contributes a lot
8533039 my experience is in doubles so i just have to do whats best for the team
8533040 its important to tell the younger girls that might think doubles isnt as important a lot of times thats where you need to get the point to win team matches
8533041 snyder s been really encouraging hes always telling us to stay positive and work hard no matter what the score is
8533042 theres a big rivalry between us and my best friend harbison is on their team
8533043 theyre hungry to get the season going and are ready to get back to that point and have an opportunity to complete the mission were going to take one game at a time and play hard
8533044 the kids are focused on it right now this is an experienced group who is working hard having that bad taste in their mouth makes them work even harder
8533045 the returning starters are leading by example and leading verbally
8533046 it will be a lot for a defense to prepare for
8533047 one thing weve developed in the offseason is the sharing of the ball in the passing game
8533048 we dont want to be one dimensional we want to line up three or four wide and have several reads for rob to go through
8533049 we wanted to get both of them more involved in the action
8533050 theyre great cover guys and are tough and physical in run support
8533051 hes accurate with a strong leg he worked hard over the summer and is ready to take over the punting duties as well were looking for a big year from him
8533052 a lot of people questioned whether we should have played a 10th game
8533053 they didnt necessarily agree beforehand but i think all our coaches agree that the game really helped our team especially the young players they saw that they really could line up play a quality football game and do good things on the field
8533054 you end last year on a win which most teams dont do now youve got a chance to start the year with a win streak
8533055 he showed us some glimpses of what he can do but hes still relatively untested
8533056 hes definitely a guy were going to be counting on this year
8533057 it definitely feels good to be the starter because i can put more of the responsibility on myself offensively and defensively
8533058 i like being able to control the whole game and doing the decision making out there its definitely a big plus
8533059 ryan led the team in tackles last year so i cant sit him out
8533060 hes too good a player to take him out of there
8533061 i always remind myself that tyler palko played both ways too
8533062 i like being on the field all the time its nice to be able to give out the hits when you have to take them all the time
8533063 we werent getting what we wanted out of that 3 5 formation so were going back to what we coach best
8533064 the win last year gave a lot of the younger guys some confidence
8533065 we have big openings to fill we have some kids who are working hard our strength right now is maybe our attitude weve got to become more mature and gain experience were a young football team
8533066 last year i couldnt get comfortable at one position on each side of the ball
8533067 he didnt miss one workout he has a positive attitude
8533068 at the speed camp we also worked on agility and footwork
8533069 a lot of people questioned whether we should have played a 10th game
8533070 they didnt necessarily agree beforehand but i think all our coaches agree that the game really helped our team especially the young players they saw that they really could line up play a quality football game and do good things on the field
8533071 you end last year on a win which most teams dont do now youve got a chance to start the year with a win streak
8533072 he showed us some glimpses of what he can do but hes still relatively untested
8533073 hes definitely a guy were going to be counting on this year
8533074 it definitely feels good to be the starter because i can put more of the responsibility on myself offensively and defensively
8533075 i like being able to control the whole game and doing the decision making out there its definitely a big plus
8533076 ryan led the team in tackles last year so i cant sit him out
8533077 hes too good a player to take him out of there
8533078 i always remind myself that tyler palko played both ways too
8533079 i like being on the field all the time its nice to be able to give out the hits when you have to take them all the time
8533080 we werent getting what we wanted out of that 3 5 formation so were going back to what we coach best
8533081 i wasnt sure how tim was going to be but hes worked real hard during summer practices he was kicking the ball to the end zone on kickoffs so hes gotten a lot stronger
8533082 if something happens to scheidler we have nobody weve tried to find someone and we just dont have it
8533083 the win last year gave a lot of the younger guys some confidence
8533084 its nice to have brought something back to sewickley that hasnt been here in a whole generation
8533085 last year just as a warm up before the girls came for cheerleading practice i was spinning and tossing and they asked can we do that
8533086 my plan was to get majorettes into the high school all along
8533087 as they advanced quickly and they were committed to it i saw that it was a reality
8533088 everyone went to football games to cheer on the team and to watch their friends in the band and on the sidelines
8533089 the cheerleaders the majorettes the band its all part of what football season is all about and it really brings the community together
8533090 nowadays its harder to keep girls in certain activities because of all the options out there
8533091 and these girls have really dedicated themselves to doing this for the past year they made a commitment to it and stuck to it
8533092 theyre with me all week we twirl monday cheer tuesday twirl wednesday and cheer thursday
8533093 it gets the younger people motivated because theyre able to see what the band is all about
8533094 the more the other kids see what were all about the better our chances of adding girls to our group
8533095 because of so many close games last year a lot of these young kids didnt get a lot of varsity experience i told them before preseason camp that there is going to be competition for several starting spots and that no starters are written in stone
8533096 its been tough at times because there hasnt been a set lineup one day this kid looks good and the next day another kid at the same position looks good the kids understand the opportunities they have to get on the field
8533097 both josh and brandon might get playing time over the first few games of the season if thats what it takes
8533098 both are very inexperienced we had a lot of close games last year and kyle didnt come out a lot
8533099 in quad a the game is usually won or lost on the line of scrimmage
8533100 we have a long way to go we have new starters at key positions it might take a few games into the season to find where the offense is
8533101 i have been eased into this and my receivers are doing well
8533102 its nice to have brian there in big situations and we have a lot of good players
8533103 locke is a pocket passer and he can really throw the ball
8533104 well have a lot of competition and a lot of work to do
8533105 when i saw it i was happy but then i wasnt happy at the same time
8533106 i was happy because we can probably have a better record and do better in this conference but at the same time you always want to go up against the best competition
8533107 century teams are very good teams and a lot of that is because theyre well coached
8533108 beaver county has some good coaches as well but there are great athletes on those teams i really think that we have just as many good athletes as the teams well see in this conference
8533109 i definitely think we can be in the playoffs this year i know im going to do everything in my power to make sure we do
8533110 but then if we do make it i dont want to make it and just lose in the first round i want to try and win it all
8533111 if we can get through the first half of our season which is the toughest part of our schedule with a couple wins and not many injuries then by mid fall we should be right in the thick of things
8533112 the trip to texas is a great bonding experience for the guys
8533113 it should be a pretty competitive game were looking forward to it
8533114 last year we were young to start and then injuries took their toll
8533115 we have 11 starters back and several others who contributed but we need to stay injury free to have success
8533116 in triple a there are more teams with better athletes and they play more of a power football game it will be a big challenge for the players and coaching staff
8533117 we will count on john to run the system we have run for 17 years
8533118 we will be a run first team but we will throw the ball more and mix it up
8533119 the familiarity of our opponents is gone so we will have to work harder as a coaching staff
8533120 we are not quite sure what to expect but since we are new teams wont know what to expect from us either
8533121 i think the boys finally understand our scheme on defense and finally after two years were going to have quarterbacks that have solidified that position
8533122 were going to move kort around hes going to be lined up in three or four different positions
8533123 with him dorian goosby dean jeffrey besong and michael hermes weve got some weapons
8533124 i want to run for 2 000 yards try to get 200 every game
8533125 but as long as we win thats the main thing if i rush for two yards but get two touchdowns and we win 14 6 ill be happy
8533126 if summer is any indication our players are going to perform well
8533127 i can say honestly this is the first time a team has really jelled since we started here thats a tribute to our seniors theyve been playing together a long time theyve taken care of the young guys and they want to leave their legacy of getting the football program back to where it used to be
8533128 as a senior ive got to go hard every play in practice
8533129 i know the younger guys are going to see what i do and do what i do thats why ive got to go 100 percent every day
8533130 were going to be one of the smaller schools in our section weve worked much harder in the weight room than we have in previous years but that being said we still need to do a better job to compete with the size that some of these teams have
8533131 i think the biggest change is that a lot of people have been in the weight room
8533132 theres just a lot of freshmen coming up that are real dedicated thatll help us too because you need all the guys working together out there
8533133 if anything from the first year to now we want to stay the course
8533134 last year we were teaching two new systems and you have no one to demonstrate it because the seniors dont know it this year we want to hit the ground running the guys know the system and they know what we expect of them
8533135 weve been repping the same plays over and over again we just keep running them until we get them perfect and well get there
8533136 weve been practicing all summer to get the plays down and now were just building on that
8533137 with the injuries weve had in camp a lot of the young guys have stepped in
8533138 theyre proven that if theyre given the opportunity well be alright
8533139 weve been short on running backs in camp but the freshmen underclassmen theyve been stepping up so thats good for us
8533140 neither one of those guys got a great deal of varsity snaps but because of the time theyve put in during the offseason it feels like theyre returning starters
8533141 eddies our big guy coming back from last year he knows the system and plays going downhill hes the leader of the defense and hes going to make a lot of tackles
8533142 weve got a young squad but theres a lot of teams like us in the new conference
8533143 i think could go about 5 4 and battle for the playoffs this year
8533144 the kids have really been into it and are working hard
8533145 i feel like im behind in all areas but mostly in the area of off season and strength training
8533146 from that standpoint i wish the move to hampton would have happened sooner your regular season is always made in the off season
8533147 i know that i am really excite and i think that our kids are just as excited
8533148 i feel rejuvenated its the newness of it all you get excited when you get a new car or a new house its no different with this its exciting
8533149 i wont know how good well be until we play against some other teams but i know there are great coaches and players in triple a
8533150 everyone is trying to gel and get a feel for each other
8533151 we also have four new coaches who weve never worked with chemistry is something that takes time
8533152 we are making some mistakes but we are learning from them
8533153 there well be some emotions for sure but no animosity i have no bad feelings toward shaler
8533154 then i hope we can keep this early enthusiasm we have we have a good group of kids and i think well be fun to watch
8533155 compared to previous years weve had great music but it hasnt always appealed to a football crowd this year crowds should really get into our show
8533156 the concept of the show is about creating a dream
8533157 band camp was a lot of work and very tiring but we had fun and got to know each other a little better
8533158 its really crazy the first time you put the music to the drills
8533159 you spend so much time learning how to move and when you put it with the drills it really makes you proud
8533160 hes brought a lot of new perspectives to the table
8533161 at first it was a big adjustment because he came in last minute last year but he found his place here
8533162 i feel very optimistic that we can be quite successful this year
8533163 we all love music and we all love marching band
8533164 im thinking more about how i act and what im saying
8533165 one of my friends was always talking about how much fun she had in the band
8533166 and i was always a little jealous because there were always a lot of people that i wanted to know in the band when i was younger but never really did
8533167 i think the boys finally understand our scheme on defense and finally after two years were going to have quarterbacks that have solidified that position
8533168 were going to move kort around hes going to be lined up in three or four different positions
8533169 with him dorian goosby dean jeffrey besong and michael hermes weve got some weapons
8533170 i want to run for 2 000 yards try to get 200 every game
8533171 but as long as we win thats the main thing if i rush for two yards but get two touchdowns and we win 14 6 ill be happy
8533172 if summer is any indication our players are going to perform well
8533173 i can say honestly this is the first time a team has really jelled since we started here thats a tribute to our seniors theyve been playing together a long time theyve taken care of the young guys and they want to leave their legacy of getting the football program back to where it used to be
8533174 as a senior ive got to go hard every play in practice
8533175 i know the younger guys are going to see what i do and do what i do thats why ive got to go 100 percent every day
8533176 were going to be one of the smaller schools in our section weve worked much harder in the weight room than we have in previous years but that being said we still need to do a better job to compete with the size that some of these teams have
8533177 i think the biggest change is that a lot of people have been in the weight room
8533178 theres just a lot of freshmen coming up that are real dedicated thatll help us too because you need all the guys working together out there
8533179 over the past two or three months ive fallen even more in love with the kids
8533180 i like their work ethic and their discipline im excited
8533181 we are a green team for sure and we have a brand new staff
8533182 im still trying to find my way around we are definitely behind the eight ball i know its going to be an uphill battle
8533183 the group last year played together the year before also and they never got hurt so now up front our guys are all new and they have no experience
8533184 dan mcginley jesse dellavalle and john orr all had significant playing time last year so my expectations are higher for them
8533185 theyve had to do a lot of work considering they have zero experience but i think theyre going to be good
8533186 its a learning process but its exciting everythings new and it seems like everyones excited
8533187 i believe that defensive coach dave szlachetka is one of the best in the wpial im glad hes on my staff and i know that he will turn out one of the top defenses in aa
8533188 hes just an outstanding football player who wants to be on the field for every play
8533189 theyre both progressing nicely and they both realize that theyve got good people at the skill positions to make it easier for them
8533190 weve got roman dave brown senior billy nickel senior and bryan nickel junior theyre all good runners offensively that is our position of strength
8533191 weve got everybody back roman dave tim rob ruffner senior and brian nickel who will also see time at safety
8533192 sean gives us more options when we cross the 50
8533193 i feel good about this team but were thin in numbers weve got seven sophomores on the team and naturally theres not much experience there we hope that we dont have to play them before theyre ready they do have talent though
8533194 i say it every year this conference gets you ready for the playoffs
8533195 this is the biggest team up front since ive been here and theyre experienced too when youre going up against a penn hills and a woodland hills every year you need some big bodies weve got them this year i feel that martin and diefenbach are d i prospects
8533196 julian prepared himself very well for this season he was starting to come on last year im looking for him to have a very big year
8533197 in the game that he got injured in he had 120 yards at the half
8533198 were a different team with him in there we need someone to step up until montay gets back and we havent seen that yet
8533199 its our most experienced position were very pleased with our receivers
8533200 its good to have a lot of experienced players returning but we still play a lot of guys both ways the key to usmaking the playoffs is staying healthy injuries have hit us hard over the last few years
8533201 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

8533207 i wanted to learn how we could run a stateless government without physical infrastructure
8533208 trying to keep up with the engineering work and data capability that were doing makes no sense
8533209 they come out saying their data is much safer through google
8533210 we have initiatives to get more information into the google index

8533225 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
8533226 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side
8533227 i think most of the fans there are just there to enjoy the experience and uh drink beer i mean is that not true
8533228 i think we have great fans and they love baseball
8533229 but if you go to wrigley its kind of an experience i think a lot of our fans are tourists and theyre in town on summer vacation and they just want to check out wrigley
8533230 i think everyone knows hes a white sox fan but maybe he will lose votes who knows
8533231 this youth council represents a very interesting initiative that deserves care and interest
8533232 the ycc promotes a greater exchange of leadership experience between youth and political leaders from one generation to another this generations problems are different from the past particularly in terms of unemployment
8533233 that isnt even 10 percent of the number of applicants so how can young people find work with such a dismal percentage
8533234 its important to talk more about the private sectors role and seek better cooperation between the public and private sectors were talking about the future here so i believe its important for all sides and parties to help build a safe one
8533235 yemens ministry of higher education and the civil services ministry should have a strategy of cooperation so that college graduates will be able to find jobs this also would help dispel the many unacceptable phenomena that are growing in this country one of which is terrorism
8533236 for example if a student studies history he or she may only be able to teach so what if theres no need for history schoolteachers we cant do anything about such cases thus we need more doctors and engineers because such jobs are always available
8533237 also in the 2006 report we addressed the issue of favoritism which is a very common problem in yemen most graduates cant find jobs because those with social or political power install their relatives in government positions instead of others
8533238 its a very transparent report and were looking forward an even better report for 2007
8533239 provide a convenient security atmosphere suitable to the rituals of ramadan
8533240 today the ministry is more stable and insistent upon carrying out the resolution to ban arms bearing
8533241 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8533242 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8533243 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8533244 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8533245 a number of school principals in sanaa governorate are being investigated for collecting fees from primary school students which is an infringement of the ministry of educations decree
8533246 poor people find it difficult to afford school fees so this will help them save some money for other essentials like food
8533247 this is a significant achievement by the yemeni government illustrating its commitment to providing all children fee free primary education
8533248 weve prepared some procedures and motivations such as rationing schools for girls study in remote areas
8533249 we also have financial support from the japan international cooperation agency jica unicef and the basic education development project in yemen for girl students in governorates such as al mahwit hadramout raymah sanaa and mukalla this year the ministry has contracted 1 000 new women teachers
8533250 enrollment will increase due to having free primary education but rationing girl students is an excellent step by the government because it will cause girls schools enrollment to rise rapidly
8533251 weve started complying with the new law and not collecting fees from students in primary school grades 1 through 6 for boys and 1 through 9 for girls just a yr 50 certificate fee
8533252 when the ministry of education pays the schools per student like it promised then well return the students fees
8533253 what do parents get out of such a decision school fees dont burden families that much
8533254 fees were a significant barrier keeping children out of school so this decision will have a positive impact on education by helping poor families send their children to schools and decreasing the rate of school dropouts
8533255 we strongly reject the ruling partys action in forming the scer because such procedures are unjust illegal and meant to help the ruling party control the electoral process
8533256 the ruling party feels that it currently is suffering harsh conditions and therefore must reshuffle its agenda
8533257 the ruling party needs to postpone the upcoming parliamentary elections but it doesnt want to be accountable for such so it is directing the charge of postponement at the jmp
8533258 darling im ready to get engaged to you this week but our marriage must be postponed for at least two years
8533259 because im your life partner i should share in all of your problems so im prepared to wait for you even more than 10 years
8533260 i want to get a job and teach after marriage
8533261 european institutions have succeeded and improved only through the support of journalists the media and charitable organizations
8533262 were in need of more than a hospital to treat cancer patients but of course this requires more money and support
8533263 the required fee for a single yemeni student in the faculties of medicine and pharmacy is 2 450 annually which restricts the access of less financially able students to these scientific specialities
8533264 my hobby is the only thing i had to start this business
8533265 it is easy for me to start this business because i started the same business in another place but i decided to relocate to do better
8533266 the fee we take is for hygiene development and advertisement
8533267 we always go by force to get people who open new businesses to have their license
8533268 it is very reasonable the price and it does not need more that half an hour to get it done
8533269 i have learnt grafting cross pollination and planting in this office with foreigners
8533270 it had burnt my nursery because as they said that my trees are sick and i am not caring of it using insecticide
8533271 we are suffering from those who come without having any official papers and ask us money like tax and wajebat
8533272 we have to know english language to understand manufacture and company names and programming new appliances
8533273 there were some difficulties at the first time to understand the work
8533274 debt is difficult to pay back also rent is high and causing a problem nowadays
8533275 i can not call it successful work but it is a kind of work to get money if i found a better job i would not hesitate to leave it for something else
8533276 i advice people who have businesses not to chew qat it is just a waist of time
8533277 you always find new brands and types of medicine everyday
8533278 the electronic appliances make us in contact with the world old devices have good characteristics new ones are fast selling have new good characteristics although have bad material the development in the new devices which come to the market are little complex in using need us to know about them you have to know english to understand the source of the manufacturing company names and method of programming these appliances

8533302 it will be devastating if the state enforced the mandate and closed this and other hospitals in 2012
8533303 well im very disappointed very sad hundreds of community volunteers worked on that campaign it was a very large group effort
8533304 ive certainly been through the tax measure wars and sometimes you have to go to round two
8533305 im certainly very determined on a go forward basis community hospital critical importance to have the salinas valley memorial hospital
8533306 to think of this hospital closing is a thought that is not tenable the areas could not tolerate that
8533307 im in a dark tunnel alone no one can imagine what happens to me every day
8533308 i cant work and i dislike living anymore i hope to die today before tomorrow because its better than living without any hope in this life someday ill kill my self and terminate my life and pain

8533311 qat somehow plays role in increasing depression among yemeni youths especially those who chew qat constantly nevertheless there are no studies in yemen proving the relationship between qat and depression
8533312 yemeni women are more exposed to social stress for instance domestic violence or an inability to study or work unless a male relative approves in addition to some medications like contraception pills which can cause depression as a side effect
8533313 based on our experiences we estimate that 15 percent of young male yemenis and 20 percent of young females are afflicted by depression meaning that 1 in 5 yemeni females suffers from depression
8533314 if someone starts to complain about any type of pain parents or relatives immediately should send him or her to see a doctor
8533315 people dont believe in psychological problems instead preferring to go to a magician rather than a psychological doctor
8533316 therefore this puts pressure on specialist hospitals in this field but we cant take all patients due to a shortage of beds
8533317 however if we ignore it it may lead patients to kill themselves as more than 15 percent of patients suffering depression kill themselves but gloom rarely causes patients to become insane
8533318 doing so would yield many good results by reducing future depression rates among youths

8533321 if he was out of the office sick had a sick child or was overwhelmed by service calls everything else shut down
8533322 we were not comfortable having one person responsible for all of our it tasks including data protection because it was a potential liability in the event of a disaster
8533323 i feel a much greater level of comfort knowing that our data is backed up 300 miles away on a daily basis
8533324 i also feel much better knowing that i have more than one perspective on a problem previously i would have one person to ask a question or bounce an idea off of now i have one person internally and access to 4 or 5 people externally all with various backgrounds perspectives and expertise
8533325 its a great comfort knowing the data is going out every night to a site 300 miles away rather than going down the street to the bank
8533326 the process with evault and masterit has been largely transparent to our staff the backups literally run themselves

8533378 the lender pays the homeowner a certain sum each month or each year for ordinary living expenses this amount is of course deducted from the equity in the home it doesnt need to be repaid but it probably will take a big share of the profits if any when the homeowner sells or out of the estate the homeowner will not need to continue mortgage payments but still will be responsible for property taxes homeowners insurance and home repairs and it will be quite expensive when compared to other types of loans
8533379 it probably will take a big share of the profits if any when the homeowner sells

8533381 miller took the people and scenery he encountered on his 1837 trip to the rocky mountains and created paintings with many layers of meaning out of seemingly simple western genre scenes giving them intangible qualities such as mood and emotion
8533382 in doing this he produced images that were more innovative and compelling than those of many of his peers working in the west or the east
8533383 the title of this exhibition though it may remind people of the popular song was carefully chosen
8533384 during millers lifetime sentimentalism was an important means of identifying inspiring or guiding moral action sentiments are feelings guided by thoughts this exhibition will demonstrate how miller was not only interested in depicting western subjects but also portraying them through the filter of his own nineteenth century sensibilities as an artist

8533386 yousuf karsh had a special relationship with the mfa and boston ever since his apprenticeship in the city in the late 1920s
8533387 he thought of boston as his spiritual home and the museum as his university where he studied light composition and shadow we are privileged now to be the major repository in the united states for his magnificent photographs and delighted to share them with our visitors on the 100th anniversary of his birth
8533388 karshs name became synonymous with the highest level of photographic portraiture and being karshed was an honor for his sitters
8533389 this exhibition is intended to show the range of yousuf karshs work by including not only his famous portraits but also the early efforts that led to the definition of his style and the special assignment work that he undertook once he had achieved international success

8533393 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8533394 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8533395 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
8533396 we could drive this in place with irresistible sweeteners for the sunnis to join in a plan designed by the military for withdrawing and redeploying american forces and a regional nonaggression pact
8533397 partition may end up being the best solution but heres the thing we cant impose it on the iraqis the iraqis have to make the decision themselves if the iraqi government believes that it can form a unified government they should do that if they want a soft partition they should do that if they want us simply to leave we can do that too but they have to make a series of decisions
8533398 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his call to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
8533399 bidens command of foreign policy and his acquaintance with foreign leaders are impressive assests but they dont guarantee good judgment hes been wrong on iraq voting against the 1991 war to oust saddam hussein from kuwait but for the resolution that president bush used to justify his reckless 2003 invasion
8533400 broader sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism
8533401 significant concessions by shia and kurds to create space for sunni acceptance of federalism

8533407 you have a player whos as big as she is but is mobile can shoot threes can post up pass rebound and can block shots
8533408 youre talking about an elite elite player you take her out of the storm lineup well i know theyll be optimistic they have a good team they have people who know how to win but shes great she just is
8533409 if it were to have happened earlier in the year maybe you could make some adjustments but at this stage of the season youre losing arguably one of the three best players in the league
8533410 i dont know why somebody would e mail someone and say oh you guys are finished no weve got a whole team here and played without lauren for five games were acclimated with one another

8533420 if we had not won tonight then i would have said it was our own fault
8533421 i thought it was a cracking cup tie but i didnt think our football was that great
8533422 we had decent chances in the first half but we didnt take them
8533423 our back four deserve a lot of credit for handing in there in extra time
8533424 i thought our general play was generally poor but i thought forest were fantastic so they deserve credit
8533425 im pleased we have performed half decently on tv and given a decent account of ourselves so thats quite pleasing and quite a positive sign about the way we played and our appetite was excellent
8533426 we got about them but just that period before the end cost us and the boys are really disappointed they havent seen it out
8533427 i thought it the second goal might just have been offside but well get the evidence first
8533428 we just ran out of that effectiveness and energy to be decisive and really hurt them
8533429 everyone will raise their game and weve seen that through the cup ties and its about that level of performance
8533430 that is now our expectation and there is no game that is unappetising to us this season so there should be no lethargic displays this season because with players returning well be stronger and more effective
8533431 we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8533432 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8533433 i was delighted that dirk kuyt scored the goal his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8533434 his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8533435 over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8533436 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup
8533437 i sometimes wondered whether the referee was effected by the fact that we were playing a big team i felt we should have had a couple of penalties
8533438 but in the end we created a lot of good situations in both matches and did not make use of them

8533441 corsi intensivi per i prof del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola
8533442 it was a big game for us and i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8533443 it was important not to make mistakes we were patient and scored our goals
8533444 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8533445 the whole team was sharper and physically much better tonight than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8533446 they man marked all over the pitch and did not take many risks
8533447 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance today in the side
8533448 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8533449 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8533450 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8533451 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8533452 for a while he has worked on a lot of things and he has looked to have improved and found that right balance between individual play and the team play
8533453 but the way he finished tonight you cannot teach that he has that naturally
8533454 you can see many transfers announced in the media every day but it takes a lot of time and does not always happen
8533455 i was sat here yesterday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8533456 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8533457 arsenal are further on than us they have played premier league games and it showed they were fitter and stronger than they were two weeks ago
8533458 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that today
8533459 its been a great experience for the players they are a young team and they need these experiences to learn
8533460 we are in the uefa cup the season starts on saturday and there is still a lot to play for

8533478 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8533479 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8533480 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8533503 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia

8533514 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8533515 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8533516 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8533517 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8533518 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie

8533543 microsofts just slapped together a pair of special edition zunes for both the republican and the democratic national conventions and they look pretty damn great
8533544 demonstrate the highest level of commitment to offsetting their carbon footprint from attending the convention
8533545 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8533546 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos

8533553 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8533554 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8533555 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8533556 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8533557 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8533558 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8533559 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos

8533564 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8533565 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8533566 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8533567 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8533568 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8533569 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8533570 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8533571 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8533572 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8533573 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8533574 the dalai lama is fine hes just exhausted he has had a hectic schedule for the last year with events scheduled almost every day
8533575 has a little bit of discomfort in his stomach he is going for a check up now
8533576 but i havent given it any thought whatsoever my only goal is to do better than i did last year and only if it helps the team win as far as im concerned winning is my no 1 goal and my only personal goal
8533577 i dont know that you can look that far ahead and i am not too much into records so i dont know
8533578 numerically it probably is within reach but i dont know what is going to happen
8533579 personally i would love to do something like that it would be an honor to get it
8533580 but if i dont get it i am not going to put my head down and walk away and be sad like i said winning is all that matters to me if the yards come along with it then i am grateful for that
8533581 as an offensive line we want everybody to succeed and that includes harvey
8533582 hes a lot more experienced knows the offense a lot better
8533583 his confidence level is higher now that hes playing more compared to last year at this time hes miles ahead
8533584 i trust in the coaches and i trust in our offense
8533585 the load is spread between all of us max hall dennis pitta austin collie andrew george michael reed i wont have more of a burden than anyone else
8533586 the most exciting thing is just to see the whole team perform
8533587 you want to see if everything you worked on since the end of last season is working i want to see what the maturity of this team is how we handle certain situations
8533588 we need to start off on the right foot play a solid four quarters no peaks and valleys
8533589 whoever the coaches put in there were going to crank it up fast physical and intense
8533590 it would shock me if this team didnt have a winning record our expectations are very high
8533591 if we do our job on the line well be as productive as we want to be it is a high reward offense were going to take shots down the field
8533592 its supposed to be a fair competition and you almost feel like alex shouldve been able to play a half with the starters
8533593 first off let me tell you this lets get this straight theres nothing fair about this league all right if you establish yourself as an incredible player within a quarter of a game thats just the way it goes theres nothing fair about it understand that first of all ok
8533594 i also know in preseason you can do real well and that might not translate to the regular season
8533595 theres no question about it but well find out wont we
8533596 the church finds it heartening that the australian parliament is able to separate fact from fiction in these matters
8533597 we now ask others to take the senates lead and reject any attempts to vilify the exclusive brethren
8533598 during drilling operations significant amounts of light oil were observed in the mud pits and highly elevated gas readings were recorded
8533599 while this information is preliminary it does provide a strong indication of a commercial discovery
8533600 expectations should be tempered based on the information to date as it needs further confirmation
8533601 the company remains cautious until a full evaluation can be completed
8533602 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8533603 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8533604 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8533605 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy
8533606 to my knowledge these results are some of the highest grade tungsten mineralisation reported anywhere in the world and give strong encouragement to the deposits potential for future development
8533607 but that doesnt matter if the grades are there as they are in this case
8533608 i think this could be an economic deposit that we could be open cut mining in a few years time
8533609 sometimes there are movies that fail so badly they go straight to dvd well im betting this one goes straight to paperback
8533610 it wont be very hard spine when that ones published
8533611 prawns for entree no spines there chicken for main course mr speaker a good port and of course jelly for dessert
8533612 i regard the member of higgins as a great australian who made an enormous contribution to make this a great country
8533613 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8533614 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8533615 im sorry to do this to you guy just give me all your money
8533616 were gathering evidence to determine whether he is linked to those robberies
8533617 hong kong has a fantastic number of great restaurants here incredible hotels and macau next door is the little las vegas which has had an incredible boom in terms of restaurants
8533618 we hope we can find some very good one star two star and three star places in very small places
8533619 governor romney would help shore up mccains perceived lack of economic experience
8533620 also romney strategically helps as far as the states of michigan new hampshire and the mountain states like colorado new mexico and nevada that have been viewed in play as well
8533621 a disaster for all concerned and especially for the gop
8533622 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base
8533623 obama my god how many members of the electorate still think hes a muslim
8533624 they dont have to say it but they know others in the party will do it for them
8533625 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8533626 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8533627 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8533628 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8533629 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8533630 barry ofarrell has today put political point scoring ahead of the states future he said
8533631 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8533632 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8533633 unsteady on her feet her voice was slurred and her eyes were not focused
8533634 well they produced seven provisions love to ukrainian fat love to ukrainian borshch what else exotic all this is absurd i have no desire to comment i swear because it is possible to comment on serious things but to comment on absurd you may just turn into a participant of that absurd
8533635 con lo spirito di unit che ci contraddistingue e con lobiettivo comune della vittoria propongo di sospendere i conteggi e di nominare tutti assieme per acclamazione barack obama come candidato alla presidenza degli stati uniti
8533636 acma found that the program contained both aggressive coarse language and very coarse language neither of which is permitted in m classified programs the acma statement said
8533637 have confirmed that the very coarse language contained in the program will not be broadcast in any future programs
8533638 its something were concerned about obviously because of the fatigue factor and the burnout factor
8533639 overtime is something thats a necessary component in the business of public safety you dont just punch out because youre at 48 hours of overtime
8533640 we would certainly hope that the current sheriffs administration takes a look at the data with an eye toward seeking a resolution as soon as possible
8533641 excessive overtime over the standards can affect job performance and this is an issue of mutual concern to the sheriffs department and to us
8533642 the drop in the rate of failed tests despite the significant increase in the number of tests is very pleasing
8533643 three years of results shows that taking immediate action in referring players to counselling and treatment is making a difference after 2000 tests we now have evidence that our approach is working to change behaviour
8533644 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8533645 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8533646 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8533647 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge
8533648 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand
8533649 who the heck would put on a show on labour day
8533650 i really think that destroyer is going to cause a real noise at the show it will be a really noisy set from us
8533651 at least the mess will be easy to clean up in there
8533652 i think its inevitable twenty20 will be an olympic sport
8533653 the international olympic committee could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics just think about the audiences in the sub continent
8533654 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 is how do we make it work
8533655 we definitely need a carve out period im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8533656 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8533657 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game
8533658 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8533659 when my spirit grows faint within me it is you who know my way
8533660 in everything you do put god first and he will direct you and crown your efforts with success
8533661 ericsson have done a very good job here and build up a large installed base we believe we can revitalise that and grow the business with the aastra product portfolio and the former ericsson portfolio
8533662 we are decentralising and putting back the ownership of the business to the local entity
8533663 we are just starting out we have most of the team we are up to 10 people but we wil be looking for more we have an office
8533664 the chance to vote whats in your heart during the roll call vote
8533665 i signed my ballot this morning for senator obama but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice
8533666 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8533667 because we were on the right side of history and it won t work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8533668 more than a paycheck its dignity its respect its about whether you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be ok
8533669 on the most important national security issues of our times john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8533670 president bill clinton who reminded us what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first
8533671 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8533672 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8533673 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8533674 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8533675 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8533676 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8533677 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8533678 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8533679 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8533680 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8533681 in developing database centric software for multiple clients why not use a single database rather than multiple databases for each client
8533682 how do you balance legacy code that nobody wants to update with programmers who want to use the latest and greatest stuff
8533683 povert ed evangelici aggressivi le micce che hanno acceso la rabbia degli estremisti
8533684 vediamo in paolo un impegno che si spiega soltanto con unanima realmente affascinata dalla luce del vangelo innamorata di cristo
8533685 e sono andato scoprendo che proprio il s detto a persone e a certe circostanze ti rende familiare cristo e da questa familiarit con lui nasce una certezza di bene che tende a investire anche il rapporto con tutte le altre circostanze con tutte le altre persone anche quelle che sono non solo appaiono esteriormente pi avverse
8533686 senza il contatto continuo con cristo la misura del vivere il calcolo in una preoccupazione continua per quella che ancora non c
8533687 the final assault was launched late last night by the special forces of the army and entire family of the house owner including four children was rescued

8533695 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8533696 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8533697 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8533698 everyone is subject to the law even websites and blogs
8533699 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8533700 but when they publish things that are libellous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for skmm to act
8533701 skmm may have briefed the minister on the issue but not me
8533702 i am aware of the issue but it is not under my jurisdiction
8533703 having missed on the league and cup this season we need to win something and playing in the regional tourney is a good prospect we shall target a minimum of a semi final place
8533704 we have to strike a balance and since pirates ii are not entered into the 7s we can have a huge pool to choose from
8533705 following this observation we have set aside a national coaches development programme for discussion with the nigeria football association while the assistance of corporate sponsorship in this regard is desired locally and internationally
8533706 good corporate governance which is the theme of the seminar will help us manage our league properly
8533707 the development program for this new product was based on options long standing relationship with the vodafone group a stylish design is important for mass market appeal while the unprecedented growth of voice and data traffic in the 2100mhz band is making hspa support in the 900 mhz band a commercial imperative our new device is the first commercially available hspa expresscard in the world to incorporate support for that 900mhz band

8533747 while i regret my three years of incarceration i have no bitterness and now understand how it could happen
8533748 most valuable and economical defector this agency has ever had
8533749 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8533750 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8533751 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8533752 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8533753 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8533754 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8533755 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8533756 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8533757 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8533758 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8533759 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8533760 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8533761 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8533762 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8533763 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8533764 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8533765 hallo i havent seen in five years but how are u now like i would care but since youre my facebook friend of course i wonna know
8533766 a nato est prestes a acolher no seu seio pa ses medrosos ressentidos nas m os de pol ticos sem um pingo de bom senso e com uma vontade exagerada de provocar a r ssia
8533767 know the effect of hope in human beings it can be profound says the following
8533768 this guy is nuts tomorrow will be worse or tomorrow will be the same as any other day come back to earth
8533769 hope is the worst of evils for it prolongs the torments of man
8533770 life is agony and hope illusion and despair all commingled but despair outlasts all
8533771 if you lose hope somehow you lose the vitality that keeps life moving you lose that courage to be that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all
8533772 hope begins in the dark the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing the dawn will come you wait and watch and work you dont give up of course full of hope the prophet joel prophesied of a day when gods spirit would be poured out on all people that day when gods daughters and sons would prophecy and old men would dream dreams and young men would see visions for the spirit would be alive in all
8533773 here is my servant whom i have chosen the one i love and with whom i am pleased i will send my spirit upon him and he will announce my judgment to the nations
8533774 be ready to give an account of the hope that is within you to everyone who asks
8533775 and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us
8533776 be joyful in hope patient in affliction faithful in prayer
8533777 but since we belong to the day let us be self controlled putting on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation as a helmet
8533778 let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful
8533779 so that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
8533780 what you mean jesus loves me just as i am
8533781 i must leave you now i was good to you but i cant take what you are doing to me anymore
8533782 you just swoop in here take our grand kids away from us and expect us to move on in life isnt loosing a son enough damage for one parent
8533783 yes hello do you think we could be civil adults and not argue in front of the kids
8533784 and it only a claim see point b below through his own violent actions
8533785 well thats your opinion you say it is and i say its not
8533786 stay here in your car while i run this information
8533787 i am only going to give you a warning this time it will not go on your record
8533788 es geht darum die abgeordneten auf linie zu bringen die entscheidungen fallen woanders
8533789 i dont think it really matters who you play you can say some teams are better than others but thats only on paper
8533790 its fun just to see a team how they interact with each other who they play offensively and defensively so yeah ill still pay 50 and ill still be happy with what im seeing
8533791 la vita un viaggio breve come puoi essere sicuro di riempirla con quanto di pi divertente ci sia visitando i pi bei posti che esistono sulla terra prima di fare la valigia per lultimo viaggio

8533794 honestly i didnt think i hit it out i just thought it was going in the gap its a big part of the yard i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us that means weve won all three of the road series now we just have to come out tomorrow and try to win
8533795 the one thing he told me early on is that he was kind of looking forward to being in the middle of all this stuff
8533796 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and to have red sox across my jersey and take the mound in a big series and get to pitch is just a blast its like a playoff game its nice when you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game i just love to compete i love to play baseball i love to get out and battle the fact that the games count here is just fantastic for me nothing better than being in a big series
8533797 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankees series for me
8533798 you go out there and every game is crucial all of a sudden you come into this series and i kind of feel like ive been in this scenario for a month from where im coming from
8533799 when i walked into this clubhouse i remember getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away i got a smile on my face its just a good memory and this is the last year of the stadium so you think about things like that once you take the hill im just focused on the hitters and trying to get them out and help this team get to the playoffs
8533800 j d drew losing mike lowell tim wakefield for a little bit josh beckett skipped a start those are huge players on this team i feel like this team has kind of weathered that this team has a lot of character and they play really really hard its a pleasure to be a part of it
8533801 hes kind of the energizer bunny for this team hes the one who stirs stuff up just kind of everything he does he plays good defense hes got some pop hes a huge huge part of this team
8533802 the game was 7 2 and i was just trying to hit a fly ball and get one more run in
8533803 he attacked the zone he is what he is he goes out there and competes were all excited to have him around
8533804 he plays the game the right way he plays hard he plays great defense hes always in the right spot at the right time hes been huge for us
8533805 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search
8533806 were seeing that a number of guys committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
8533807 there were 1 592 arrests during that period for possession of knives and other weapons as a result of that 1 445 knives are off the streets
8533808 he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8533809 he will have an operation and could be out for ten to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8533810 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 per cent fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8533811 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic we talked with the doctor and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8533812 whats a girl to do while waiting for mr right

8533845 we understand theyre still in the airport compound or buildings close to it
8533846 theyre now awaiting news of a plane to take them back to khartoum
8533847 that is the same state cannot deploy a certain group without any limit
8533848 obviously there are other nato affiliated nations out doing things
8533849 the military forces which have not yet pulled back to the lines they held before the hostilities must move without delay
8533850 nobody wants to go back to the time of the cold war nato is not an adversary but a partner of russia
8533851 as for the european union it seeks to build with this country a close and positive relation it is for russia today to make a fundamental choice

8533853 but the thing is to try to be good mentally and physically because i think i am playing good tennis
8533854 the first round always is difficult and hopefully next round i play much better
8533855 there was a fracture in my right hand ring finger which i sustained while taking a caught and bowled chance
8533856 already pakistan is not playing a test series this year and we are short of cricket
8533857 it has to be a very limited application i mean very limited it cant certainly get into other plays where an umpire has a view of an out or safe call or a strike zone call or whether a fielder caught a ball
8533858 having been nifelheim fans for over ten years this is quite the honor for us
8533859 we hope to see all of our supporters on the road
8533860 everything i learned in eight years as president has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8533861 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8533862 i think this convention has gone pretty well so far
8533863 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8533864 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8533865 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8533866 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8533867 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8533868 john mccain is my friend i mean it weve known each other for three decades weve travelled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amazes me
8533869 despite being complicit in the bush administrations catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack isnt ready to protect our national security
8533870 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to drawdown our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8533871 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8533872 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8533873 just the thought that he cared enough to run to risk his life that means a lot
8533874 its like im living my dream last night i was sitting in there with some lady i dont even know and we were both just crying
8533875 but i was definitely a little puzzled as to why i didnt stay in the game they chose to go back to alex and thats the way it went
8533876 its difficult when youre feeling it and they pull you and we have a chance to win the ballgame
8533877 it was a good experience but frustrating at times knowing i can have a great game and still be the no 2 guy
8533878 so i had to come in each and every day and play hard as if im the no 1 guy i tried to get into the mindset of looking forward i knew my time would come
8533879 he can thread a lot of needles a lot of people cant
8533880 we want a guy that can throw it hands down
8533881 hes got to be able to be a great passer
8533882 but were going to do it just enough that theyre going to honor it
8533883 seven yards back to the huddle and seven yards back to the line of scrimmage thats a long way if theres 75 plays
8533884 top shelf that became apparent right away ability wise hes got a lot of tools hes got a great arm and for a taller kid surprising mobility
8533885 hes played very little but hes got a ton invested i think hes looking forward to cashing in on that investment
8533886 i havent seen him get real rattled but he hasnt been live yet either
8533887 the july case shiller data is about as bad as it gets it shows a housing sector where prices remain in free fall in just about each market save a few such as charlotte north carolina and dallas
8533888 the housing bottom has not occurred and its not near
8533889 at this stage lease or rent through at least june 2009
8533890 in most major markets prices are likely to be lower by next spring than they are this day
8533891 your attorney has information on current comparable sales in your interest area and hes more prone to give you objective information on market conditions and where the markets headed
8533892 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8533893 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8533894 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8533895 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8533896 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8533897 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8533898 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8533899 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8533900 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8533901 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8533902 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8533903 when we have our relievers organized and healthy i think we have the better bullpen with mets closer billy wagner out
8533904 we had lidge ready if case rudy got into a jam
8533905 but then when he got two quick outs we decided to let him go on delgado we talked about it it didnt work out
8533906 im down there for a reason to be used however charlie wants me to be used
8533907 i have to make sure im geared up and ready at all times my mind set will be to be ready at any time from here on out
8533908 now we need to just take care of business the way things are going i think the race is going to be neck and neck right down to the last week of the season
8533909 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8533910 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8533911 they can and have sent a great message of unity and the stakes involved in this election
8533912 all the americans who arent as hard core democrats as we
8533913 as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
8533914 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8533915 youve got bill clinton supporters and youve got hillary supporters
8533916 the people that are really loyal to bill clinton wont listen as much to hillary and vice versa
8533917 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8533918 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama had been proven right
8533919 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8533920 it is with great pride that i announce that barack obama is the democratic nominee for the president of the united states
8533921 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8533922 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8533923 divisive politics that is all about tearing people down instead of lifting this country up
8533924 senator obama tries to elevate the dialogue in this country
8533925 by no means will joe biden take it in the gutter but what he will do is point out the clear distinctions between the parties
8533926 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8533927 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up together
8533928 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready and barack obama is ready

8533930 first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
8533931 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and jill biden and son beau biden and mama biden and the whole biden family with me on this journey to take america back
8533932 no not at all im realistic and reality is i cannot do everything but i know what im capable of doing and i trust all my teammates
8533933 greatness is a very different thing its not an empty word you cant describe it you have to live it you have to understand it you have to go through every little task you can go through and then you really realize it
8533934 it takes a little more time a few years still
8533935 we understand he cannot be perfect all the time but those guys make a lot of money because they can do things other people cant they stop the bleeding they save the bullpen they stop the losing streak it goes beyond wins and losses it goes beyond era
8533936 an ace can go out there and win when things dont go exactly their way a guy like johan santana
8533937 its about what we do as a team every time you win it makes you feel good even though you didnt have your best performance or outing
8533938 the great ones they completely understand their responsibility that day
8533939 trying to find someone who can pitch the ninth inning
8533940 we believe it was all part of an effort by the sheriffs department to flush out mr astorga to give publicity to the fact that his family was being impacted by his actions
8533941 they just simply filed the charges arrested her caused her to post bond barred her from going to work and then neglected the case dropped it
8533942 had the u s marshals today come to my house and search my house

8533949 the governor the democrats and the republicans are all saying in this winter heating season we need to add some state dollars to liheap to assure some reasonable level of coverage and in the event the federal money arrives in the last minute
8533950 the only disagreement is whether you actually pay for it now and pay as you go which is the republican approach
8533951 i think they want to link emergency funding to liheap with some kind of democratic energy proposal
8533952 the fact is a lot of people arent going to be able to afford heating oil in october november and december
8533953 people are playing politics with what is a serious issue
8533954 with 80 percent of maine homes relying on oil to heat their home there is no escaping the need for emergency heating assistance and winterization kits for homes that are amenable to such techniques however you cannot put weather stripping on a door that doesnt close
8533955 there should be thought given to passing a housing bond bill to raise new capital and there should be serious consideration given to how new federal housing dollars could be spent to redevelop low quality housing into green affordable housing

8533972 to my knowledge these results are some of the highest grade tungsten mineralisation reported anywhere in the world and give strong encouragement to the deposits potential for future development

8533974 i think this could be an economic deposit that we could be open cut mining in a few years time
8533975 during drilling operations significant amounts of light oil were observed in the mud pits and highly elevated gas readings were recorded
8533976 while this information is preliminary it does provide a strong indication of a commercial discovery
8533977 expectations should be tempered based on the information to date as it needs further confirmation
8533978 the company remains cautious until a full evaluation can be completed
8533979 upbeat capex readings are unlikely to prevent the rba delivering the much anticipated rate cut next week said michael blythe chief economist at commonwealth bank
8533980 it would take a stick of dynamite to shift market views at the current point the capex data does however fit in with the idea that it will be a reasonably modest and cautious easing cycle
8533981 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8533982 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes

8533985 roulette history is hard to come by because the origin of roulette is lost and there was likely some form of a wheel based game going back almost as far as the origin of the wheel itself
8533986 several early versions of a wheel and spinning ball were invented in the 17th and 18th centuries in europe
8533987 in the mid 19th century the single zero game was invented in france this reduced the casinos edge thereby increasing the odds of the player
8533988 the use of the double zero roulette wheels survived in the united states and is sometimes called the american wheel

8533993 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients

8534001 also romney strategically helps as far as the states of michigan new hampshire and the mountain states like colorado new mexico and nevada that have been viewed in play as well
8534002 a disaster for all concerned and especially for the gop
8534003 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base

8534065 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8534066 we are concerned about blurring the lines between who is an aid worker and who is a soldier
8534067 if we are mistaken for soldiers in very dangerous situations we can become targets
8534068 we too are a face of america overseas and a very positive one and our work through civilians enables america to show a positive side of how we can help others around the world

8534075 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8534076 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader

8534100 thats why we recommend people pick a day every year and search it

8534123 now for the first time the scrolls will be a computer click away

8534128 if it looks like its coming this way im gone
8534129 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8534130 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet

8534172 both games this weekend are a step up in competition for us
8534173 we have to be sharper in the way we pass the ball more disciplined in defense
8534174 we were a little rusty and a little fatigued we did some good things going forward and i think well be better this weekend than we were last weekend
8534175 weve got a lot of work to do on organizing our defense and our attack coming together
8534176 those things take time weve only been together a couple of weeks
8534177 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8534178 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8534179 coach prince had a plan when we hired him and hes sticking with that plan
8534180 he makes adjustments accordingly and i think its terribly important that we demonstrate that we have a commitment it takes time its not a one season deal
8534181 i think it was particularly important at this point in time to provide assurances that hes going to be here for four more years
8534182 thats a strong communication to people its a strong communication to recruits and their families
8534183 still a long way from oil and gas infrastructure but gas traders will be keenly focused on direction magnitude of this summers first storm to potentially impact energy markets
8534184 while it is too early to project gustavs precise path conditions appear right for it to grow in to a major storm
8534185 if youre a parent looking to send your child to the university that site could be a little misleading
8534186 at the same time im for being totally open about whats going on
8534187 they are still attempting to see if anyone else assisted
8534188 we wanted to get a picture of the state of womens health and reproductive health care and give women a way to share their stories
8534189 you need to advocate for breast feeding support at state agencies
8534190 for instance i am a ut graduate student and had nowhere to pump breast milk after i went back to school i had to stop breast feeding my daughter before i was ready there needs to be a law that requires all state agencies to have lactation rooms for breast feeding mothers
8534191 i have severe endometriosis have had surgery and recently discovered another ovarian cyst
8534192 the only treatment for me is continual use birth control pills its the only way to preserve any slight possibility of fertility the movement afoot from the radical right to take away birth control will take away my health care options will basically take away any hope i have of getting pregnant as well as any hope i have of avoiding a hysterectomy
8534193 i keep thinking did the corps fix the levees is my house going to flood again am i going to have to go through all
8534194 i think its a big mistake for the chamber to even think of giving them an award
8534195 we have problems with odors a buildup of leachate erosion of the landfill and pollution of creeks from both the travis and williamson county landfills i dont have a lot of confidence in water monitoring in texas
8534196 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8534197 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8534198 there is a natural proclivity among certain groups within the environmental movement to have an inherent bias toward democratic candidates
8534199 that doesnt mean they cant find people to support the environment among the republican party
8534200 the way this came up was that there were a number of complaints of roadside solicitors and their behaviors
8534201 the interest of the city is that if theres an issue to address we need to look at the reason for the problem
8534202 the next step would be looking at their needs and strategies recommendations to consider and facilitating access
8534203 its easy to say we want to be employed but we also want to look at the barriers theyre facing and factors to prohibit that
8534204 no recommendations will be made until after the council receives the study
8534205 its a great opportunity to meet and hang out with people
8534206 i didnt know that any of the texas union underground existed
8534207 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
8534208 the court should hold a hearing prior to the scheduled execution because evidence gathered from taking the depositions of holland and oconnell may serve as the basis for a reprieve request to the governor of texas
8534209 the decision will require us to make some extremely difficult decisions
8534210 unless life or limb is in immediate jeopardy or sexual abuse is about to occur
8534211 seek to involve the state courts who act as neutral magistrates in these complicated matters as early in the process as practicable
8534212 the people that ive talked to the pakistani leaders in the u s specifically in texas are very very committed to this
8534213 its not the name charlie wilson whats driving the initiative is this will be the first college in the united states that has a single chair focused on south east asia and pakistan specifically
8534214 im all for any way you can put any kind of information like that out
8534215 its just another tool in the arsenal to get information out
8534216 one good thing about it is its cheap it doesnt cost anything so from that perspective its great
8534217 to the moon the american space program in the 1960s
8534218 its important for tyler to know about texas history and what makes its citizens important
8534219 he passed over 200 education bills and he set legislation in motion that now allows students to take out loans
8534220 over 60 percent of college students need some financial aid
8534221 he did more for civil rights education and the environment probably than any other president
8534222 he used the government to help people carry out the ideologies of the new deal
8534223 the exhibit is about how nasa developed and lbjs response to sputnik
8534224 the review will include consideration of hupds diversity training community outreach and recruitment efforts as well as the ways in which harvards past experience as well as best practices elsewhere can help inform our future practice
8534225 the review will provide the department with an invaluable opportunity to benefit from mr martins expertise and to hear in new ways from the harvard community about how we might better serve our diverse population
8534226 we look forward to any recommendations generated by process that will help ensure the hupd remains as effective as possible
8534227 we have some more days of practice and well get them ready we have a lot more learning to do and we need to familiarize ourselves more with the process
8534228 were ready for a game in the sense that were just anxious to play someone else
8534229 i feel our offense is game ready we know theres going to be mistakes but i think were ready to play that game with us knowing the assignments and were ready mentally
8534230 it was very frustrating to see that and im sure it was frustrating for fans i just want us to play hard no matter the situation we just need to get after it
8534231 i dont want to let anyone down i know the excitement is there and theres no one more excited than me i cant let that affect me and i have to look at the reality and see what i can do to get this football team ready
8534232 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8534233 we pull people out of what they normally expect with a band or with a performance
8534234 we combine different elements of everything from what is visual and what is sound and what is a tactile getting people involved in every way i can if i could have crazy smells in here and weird furry things touching people im all about that
8534235 the album is not using wild animals as a metaphor it is using animals at the zoo those particular ones thats the habitat were in
8534236 everyone is part of the zoo and we are the entertainment
8534237 the concept is that humans are innately in these little cages
8534238 we have these things we go to work we drive these cars we go to cubicles so we are all part of this human zoo
8534239 this is like the fair your parents wouldnt let you go to as a kid
8534240 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8534241 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8534242 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8534243 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8534244 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8534245 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8534246 we thought we were being really clever doing something kind of like a clockwork orange sort of like a paradox nobody else saw it that way
8534247 i fell in love with a girl and then really fell in love with austin
8534248 thats where i bumped into our guitarist christopher messina we were both kind of unhappy with the groups we were in and it all just took off from there
8534249 it was really defined almost like there were rules to the music
8534250 we wanted to have a lot of interplaying lines things that on their own would sound normal and plain but when theyre together the beauty shows itself
8534251 we like to think of the music as tales from ordinary life in glorious technicolor
8534252 coming from england ive got lots of stories from both sides of the pond we want people to connect with the music we arent talking about driving around in a rolls royce were talking about things everybody deals with
8534253 we all live together outside of austin and generally dont have time to hang out in the bars so we start with a blank page and just dream up what to do we dont base it on the austin scene or anything like that
8534254 having his years of experience to call on and rely on is amazing
8534255 he shows a lot of encouragement but makes sure we are under no illusions we wake up at seven and do what we have to do it truly is amazing
8534256 we gave everything that we had that day and well hold those memories forever still though we do the same thing every time we hit the stage were real honest about it whether were playing to two people which weve done or 10 000 people
8534257 there are a lot of things on the to do list
8534258 we want to be involved in as many things as possible and make a few dreams come true if we can who knows what the future holds for electric touch but it will be exciting

8534267 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8534268 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8534269 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8534270 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8534271 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8534272 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8534273 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8534274 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8534275 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8534276 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8534277 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8534278 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug

8534286 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain

8534292 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8534293 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8534294 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8534295 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american

8534300 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8534301 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8534302 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8534303 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8534304 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8534305 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8534306 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production

8534313 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8534314 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side

8534316 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8534317 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8534318 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8534319 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8534320 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8534321 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
8534322 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8534323 the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
8534324 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
8534325 despite the israeli governments renewed commitment during the annapolis summit to freeze all settlement activity the construction has continued and almost doubled in all of the settlements and outposts on both sides of the separation barrier
8534326 this construction undermines the palestinian partners creating facts on the ground that might prevent the possibility of a peace agreement
8534327 were just trying to continue that tradition of being dominant up front
8534328 we plan to be dominant up front because were going to need that to win the national championship
8534329 i was asking why ou was blitzing so much how are they getting so much pressure on us
8534330 they said chase theyre only bringing four every time ou isnt perfect at everything they do but theyre very very good at everything they do im glad we dont play them in the regular season this year
8534331 they are just outstanding a lot of size experience maturity and talent as good as any front four ive seen in my career
8534332 you feel like youre getting ready to give up and then you think back to that last game
8534333 its something that still burns us out for the most part were labeled as people who cant finish thats what we say about ourselves were ready to prove ourselves wrong
8534334 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8534335 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8534336 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8534337 over the years id spent a great deal of time studying with my son and daughter after school making flash cards cutting and pasting in word and verbally quizzing at the kitchen table but our interaction wasnt always as uplifting and positive as it could be
8534338 i realized i was actually doing my children a disservice because
8534339 i knew what i wanted but just couldnt find it
8534340 my grandmother was quite the entrepreneur in her younger years and loved that my idea involved education she had graduated from high school in the 1920s and had continued on to secretarial school providing her with solid training for the then male dominated business world
8534341 i knew right away that gramie virgie was helping to make my dream come true and i had to pursue it hence qwizzys world began to evolve and by november 2007 i had a unique and dependable quizzing system that allowed kids parents and teachers a new way to study together while enabling students to learn a valuable skill test anticipation without the anxiety
8534342 the kids began having fun creating their own quizzes and when they went to bed i would log on use the qw edit function on the site and add in more challenging versions of the same material the fact that the site randomized the questions on their quizzes ensured that they were really learning the material as opposed to just memorizing it
8534343 i watched first hand as my kids experienced a boost in self confidence their test anxiety disappeared they left for school each day fully prepared and their grades went up
8534344 i knew how incredible it would be to get this concept into the schools both public and private along with the growing home school segment and the tutoring community
8534345 qwizzys world has become my passion and my labor of love and i truly desire to help students across the globe learn how to develop study skills that will take them successfully through all levels of school enhancing their experience along the way my ultimate goal is to someday make qw available at no cost to all students i look forward to the day that its second nature for students to create their own practice quizzes and that test anxiety is a thing of the past

8534351 non violent resistance is the most powerful weapon against the occupation
8534352 when you observe from afar you know that things are bad but you do
8534353 in effect we established an apartheid regime in the occupied territories immediately following their capture that regime exists to this day
8534354 military force was rarely the primary reason a terrorist group ended
8534355 but i wouldnt want anyone to see me like that
8534356 only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into contracts your freedom and mine cannot be separated
8534357 i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve but if needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die

8534359 are you hoping to blind your viewers and leave them wriggling on the floor like fish
8534360 like a ventriloquist philbrick sends her message through non human means a digital narrative that provokes just as it forces awareness
8534361 she invites viewers to pull her conceptual trigger and then as the work plays out compels them to experience first hand the tense seductions of power and the often brutal consequences of our anonymous systemized response to it
8534362 the military machine is as beautiful and seductive as it is menacing and intimidating brilliantly offering in its mass anonymous order the implicit promise of security as antidote to the very anxiety it instills
8534363 the machine prompts fear we respond defensively and the consequences vastly exceed scale local personal fear and global response
8534364 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land
8534365 we remain focused on margin improvement with ongoing cost reduction initiatives expected to mitigate the impact of raw material and energy cost increases
8534366 we are alert to the possibility of a further deterioration in economic conditions and whilst we may continue to experience some pockets of weakness we anticipate another period of solid progress in the remainder of the year
8534367 we are sorry please forgive us it is not south african to do this south africans are not like this
8534368 them mentality and it needs to stop regardless of what excuses we can offer up to make ok this time its not ok
8534369 south africans are not the kind of people who should stand by and watch criminals behave in this unacceptable manner
8534370 if we are talking about peace and mutual understanding it means investing in people who will later contribute to palestinian society
8534371 i am against hamas their acts and policies are wrong israel talks about a palestinian state but who will build that state if we can get no training
8534372 all that gold dont make you no gangsta dont you know that youre just looking anxious cant you see chains dont make you famous
8534373 nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations
8534374 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8534375 if we dont kill we will cease to exist the only thing that concerns me is how to ensure that the boys and men who are going to have to do the killing will be able to return home to their families and be normal human beings
8534376 the only two western nations to have established themselves in a predominantly nonwhite part of the world
8534377 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
8534378 if i were an arab leader i would never sign an agreement with israel we have taken their country there has been anti semitism the nazis hitler auschwitz but was that their fault they see but one thing we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept us

8534394 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8534395 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8534396 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8534397 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8534398 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8534399 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8534400 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8534401 its something that kind of stems from the success of the last couple of teams and its something that shows a little bit of respect for the recruiting weve done
8534402 were going to go out there and handle it the way we do and stick to the game plan
8534403 we go in there expecting to win but we dont feel the pressure
8534404 the rankings didnt really matter much to me to begin with the only thing ive been thinking about is going out there and playing our game if we do that we cant really lose no matter what rank we are
8534405 weve got a lot of guys that havent quite proven themselves at this stage yet its something that we cant hang our hat on
8534406 we have to prove that we have a talented group and i think it will be a work in progress as the season goes on
8534407 if we become a good water polo team we work together we work for each other were unselfish then the rest of it will take care of itself
8534408 cornelius md is awesome and his original works are special in their own right
8534409 after hearing cornelius md perform i had to bring his talent to the barry white organization so that they could hear
8534410 when i heard him for the first time i thought he was barry until someone told me differently
8534411 when i listen to cornelius mds sample clips i thought he was barry white and i have heard a number of impersonators
8534412 cornelius md would do an awesome job and is the best man to carry on the barry white tradition
8534413 of all the singers weve heard who try to sound like barry white cornelius md is the closest to the legendary artist
8534414 play that funky music white man play that funky music right
8534415 wow this guy totally got suckered out of his retirement funds
8534416 well weve got this fazioli its modest and only 350 000 for the budget model
8534417 how do i center a fixed width layout using css
8534418 vote first and bitch later then you can say at least you voted
8534419 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8534420 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle
8534421 my great grandmother worked as a maid in the home of william howard taft
8534422 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8534423 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8534424 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8534425 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8534426 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8534427 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8534428 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8534429 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8534430 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8534431 more of a staged press conference than an arena for learning and debate
8534432 whereas the government is warning of floods during the next two months kumi is already affected although the situation is not yet bad
8534433 the residents of omatenga are the first victims and some families have even started abandoning their homes
8534434 it is really an unfortunate situation in that before we recover from the previous floods and the current famine here we are again with floods
8534435 we are still compiling the data but from what we have seen teso is again headed for more trouble because most of the plantations are already getting soaked up and people are deserting their homes
8534436 the seven year initiative co financed by the ford foundation will create ties between micro finance institutions and formal financial mechanisms in one dozen nigerian states
8534437 you have to make a concerted effort to play schools that challenge you
8534438 weve got nothing to lose well can only get better from facing a quality opponent
8534439 we want to play the best we can and were fortunate enough to get some tough games in our schedule doesnt hurt our in state record any so why not
8534440 but really its hard to get noticed these days you have to do something different
8534441 i didnt make any bones about it when i interviewed for this job
8534442 i told the administration traveling was the way to make this a top ranked national high school program
8534443 but in order to do it there is a price to be paid
8534444 you have to make a concerted effort to play schools that challenge you
8534445 weve got nothing to lose well can only get better from facing a quality opponent
8534446 we want to play the best we can and were fortunate enough to get some tough games in our schedule doesnt hurt our in state record any so why not
8534447 but really its hard to get noticed these days you have to do something different
8534448 i didnt make any bones about it when i interviewed for this job
8534449 i told the administration traveling was the way to make this a top ranked national high school program
8534450 but in order to do it there is a price to be paid
8534451 the most exciting thing is just to see the whole team perform
8534452 you want to see if everything you worked on since the end of last season is working i want to see what the maturity of this team is how we handle certain situations
8534453 we need to start off on the right foot play a solid four quarters no peaks and valleys
8534454 le pourcentage de la population sous les 1 25 dollar par jour a t divis par deux chutant de 52 26 entre 1981 et 2005

8534458 un grand nombre de personnes restent vuln rables aux contractions conomiques ainsi qu la hausse des prix de lalimentation et de lessence depuis 2005
8534459 la profondeur de la pauvret est plus grande en afrique que dans les autres r gions la consommation moyenne des pauvres est plus basse quailleurs environ 70 cents par jour en 2005
8534460 but i havent given it any thought whatsoever my only goal is to do better than i did last year and only if it helps the team win as far as im concerned winning is my no 1 goal and my only personal goal
8534461 i dont know that you can look that far ahead and i am not too much into records so i dont know
8534462 numerically it probably is within reach but i dont know what is going to happen
8534463 personally i would love to do something like that it would be an honor to get it
8534464 but if i dont get it i am not going to put my head down and walk away and be sad like i said winning is all that matters to me if the yards come along with it then i am grateful for that
8534465 as an offensive line we want everybody to succeed and that includes harvey
8534466 hes a lot more experienced knows the offense a lot better
8534467 his confidence level is higher now that hes playing more compared to last year at this time hes miles ahead
8534468 i trust in the coaches and i trust in our offense
8534469 the load is spread between all of us max hall dennis pitta austin collie andrew george michael reed i wont have more of a burden than anyone else
8534470 its a lot of money to travel coast to coast
8534471 not a troublemaker i just didnt do everything right all the time
8534472 then the same thing i saw on film he was doing here for two years
8534473 it was hard but i wisened up and got dedicated and disciplined
8534474 id tell him david that is a 6 3 245 pound guy outmaneuver him youre not a fullback
8534475 i dont know who was happier when he got his degree
8534476 he has some unbelievable abilities very natural at catching the football and unbelievably fast
8534477 ive missed a lot of things since i havent been around him
8534478 i cant wait to see him i may just sit there and cry
8534479 not a troublemaker i just didnt do everything right all the time
8534480 then the same thing i saw on film he was doing here for two years
8534481 it was hard but i wisened up and got dedicated and disciplined
8534482 id tell him david that is a 6 3 245 pound guy outmaneuver him youre not a fullback
8534483 i dont know who was happier when he got his degree
8534484 he has some unbelievable abilities very natural at catching the football and unbelievably fast
8534485 ive missed a lot of things since i havent been around him
8534486 i cant wait to see him i may just sit there and cry
8534487 hell be a household name pretty soon he has some unbelievable abilities very natural at catching the football and unbelievably fast
8534488 we are figuring out ways to get programming to viewers literally on a daily basis
8534489 i have had a number of people tell me theyve called dish and canceled and switched their subscription to directv and the response they got from dish was we just dont see sufficient interest in the programming well there must be some interest or a lot of people wouldnt be switching to directv
8534490 this is a big matchup because whoever wins the ball game sits at the top of the standings for about five weeks and whoever loses sits at the bottom so everybody understands there is a lot at stake
8534491 theres a huge upside if you win and it is not the end of the world if you lose
8534492 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8534493 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8534494 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8534495 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8534496 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8534497 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8534498 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8534499 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8534500 faptul ca tranzitul prin republica serbia inseamna pentru cetatenii romani si scurtarea cu mult a distantei de deplasare pana la locul de munca din strainatate ii determina pe multi dintre conationali ai nostri rezidenti in italia spania si franta sa paraseasca romania iesind prin p t f portile de fier i
8534501 we need not worry about consensus or reason or opinion in matters of right and wrong the spirit of christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil most of us know better than we do as we discipline ourselves in line with our knowledge in line with the inner convictions of our hearts rather than the inclination to follow the crowd we grow
8534502 this is the time when adults are looking for a hideaway
8534503 and a comedy club is a place where they go and hide now that the kids are in school
8534504 abbiamo preso totalmente il controllo di nbt e vorremmo che altre persone si unissero a noi
8534505 waar 10 jaar geleden slechts 10 procent van de pati nten die op straat werd gereanimeerd een hartstilstand overleefden is dat nu 19 20 procent
8534506 there will be a place for each of you once you have confessed your sins
8534507 so i divorced my husband and married the man i loved
8534508 i loved one man married him and lived happily ever after
8534509 and i pleased every man who came to see me pleased them well for the right price
8534510 another sign of what a socialist would do to personal freedom and silence the truth
8534511 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p
8534512 the full email is after the jump and it marks a coordinated battle with the conservative media on a scale rarely seen from a political campaign
8534513 he had the keys to a place were we could practice it felt almost like dirty dancing minus the united states and instead of a resort it was the folkets hus basement
8534514 a book like the amazing remarkable monsieur leotard would have been good had only half of the effort gone into it but campbell and best have instead gone all out and created a comic masterpiece
8534515 with campbell you get the whole package not a page of the book gets wasted and theres something to entertain at every glance
8534516 campbells light touch with the art beautiful yet often disturbing watercolors proves supple and fluid enough to convey scenes of whimsy and scenes of horror this might just be my favorite campbell yet i cant recommend it highly enough
8534517 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year
8534518 campbells artwork meanwhile is beyond beauty his color work here crosses styles and genres and employs some brilliant panel placement as well
8534519 eddie campbells books are becoming with each passing year more stunning
8534520 its a terrific piece and a sweet return to form for campbell
8534521 first second has made a name for itself by producing quality material but this book outdoes all of its previous endeavors
8534522 its a fine eddie campbell book in the style that no one else could replicate and a joy to read
8534523 they did an amazing job weve got four kids coming back that are going to do some big things
8534524 as good of a setter she is shes a better hitter
8534525 im going to throw my big guns on the outside and see who can stop them
8534526 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8534527 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8534528 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8534529 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8534530 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8534531 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
8534532 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
8534533 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
8534534 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
8534535 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
8534536 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
8534537 im looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back
8534538 rickey robinson and king are linked by this combination of idealism and action an understanding of historical wrongs and the urgent need to redress them
8534539 loved america too much to allow its worst strain of injustice to go unchallenged despite the dangers they faced in doing so and they challenged it in subtle peaceful moral but also provocative and ultimately even revolutionary ways
8534540 and infuse them into the office of the president of the united states
8534541 barack obama has the capacity to hit but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
8534542 the original march on washington became a symbol of hope
8534543 people expected a riot and were stunned that it turned out to be not only something positive but something that went to the core of our patriotic values
8534544 so whats easy to forget is just how much the things we take for granted have changed
8534545 then it was assumed that black people couldnt gather in large numbers anywhere near politics without upheaval now youve got a black person contending for the highest office in the country its a pretty big change
8534546 it makes me feel very proud to have lived long enough to witness this im alive and im watching whats going on with great pride and which i hope will be history making
8534547 you couldnt hear all those people sitting there you couldnt hear anyone talking no noise all those people and no noise at all
8534548 the first shock was to see the people coming from everywhere
8534549 and this is the truth there were buses lined up from it looked like state to state in my lifetime it was the most magnificent thing ive ever seen
8534550 when he opened his mouth and he said i have a dream it mesmerized the crowd ive never been in an experience since where a man or a woman had the ability to bring to unity that many people so that there was a holy hush over the whole crowd that allowed everything he said to be heard
8534551 we were all kind of involved in the civil rights thing at the time
8534552 we just had strong feelings about being part of history and all of us felt it was the right thing to do
8534553 i remember being overwhelmed by the amount of people and the words
8534554 i couldnt really see king but i could hear his voice maybe it was the sound system or maybe just his voice
8534555 to see all those black people together was something new it was an uplifting experience
8534556 it was the first time id been in a group like that we were accepted like everybody else and we felt part of the whole group
8534557 the crowd was vocally divided and i could overhear their criticisms
8534558 with king being so young and inexperienced they felt that america was not ready for change
8534559 king was the first black man who was able to rally a large number of people together just like obama is
8534560 barack obama is the beneficiary of those who laid the foundation for him to be where he is
8534561 truly truly i say to you he who believes in me will also do the works that i do and greater works than these will he do because i go to the father
8534562 new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
8534563 theres a kind of history being made in this area
8534564 this is the first veterinarian group getting together without letting race or sectarian issues interfere
8534565 i dont look at them as sunni or shia i look at them as veterinarians
8534566 were also sending some of the iraqi employees that work at the centralized labs to the united states to train and then come back and train the people in the labs in baghdad and irbil
8534567 doesnt matter where the vets are from all the samples will be treated the same
8534568 this is most important to them to know that americans are not just watching them no theyre helping them training them
8534569 we heard the bang of a bomb and we heard shrieking persons in the house
8534570 glory to god in the highest no large causalities happened on my property and people
8534571 it took a long time understanding the sensitivities of all the countries within the asean and for the asean countries to understand indias sensitivities
8534572 so the potential for enhanced economic engagement between asean and india is profound
8534573 will pave the way for greater and closer economic partnership and cooperation in the future
8534574 though we have for some time envisioned regional integration we have never been able to make that vision a reality it remains a distant dream
8534575 the most important saarc instrument that will transform the grouping is safta south asian free trade agreement which is expected to create a free trade area by 2016
8534576 sri lanka has been a pioneer in trade liberalisation in the region but we do not see the same degree of reciprocity and flexibility shown by others
8534577 non tariff barriers are also found in abundance in some of our member countries
8534578 ometterebbe di specificare in modo intelligibile alcune rilevanti caratteristiche e condizioni dellofferta pubblicizzata quali ad esempio la presenza di un
8534579 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8534580 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8534581 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8534582 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8534583 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8534584 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8534585 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8534586 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8534587 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8534588 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8534589 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8534590 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8534591 i have amended my previous order from last night we will not disperse the protests
8534592 i ask the protest leaders to give themselves up to police i assign police to do this task without dispersing the rally but that doesnt mean the government will let it go on forever
8534593 its up to them the court has already ordered their dispersal i want to reassure all thai people that there will be no spark
8534594 my mother sold fish in the market with her big tummy and yet she raised all her seven kids
8534595 we tell the women fetuses are complete with souls and must not be removed on a whim
8534596 in the old days babies only died at birth or through natural deaths they were not aborted
8534597 when they ran into mishaps in their lives or careers they began to wonder if the aborted babies were taking revenge
8534598 the main agenda will be ensuring stability and security in the sco area there will be a focus on counterterrorism drugs and transnational crime from afghanistan
8534599 there are also questions of socio economic cooperation particularly in the sectors of energy transport trade finance information technologies and agriculture on the agenda
8534600 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8534601 ne sera pas lapocalypse annonc e par les amateurs de d fil s
8534602 las pelotas a bal n parado siguen lastim ndonos ya han sido varias las que nos han hecho pero creo que el equipo ha mejorado mucho
8534603 nunca me meto en el arbitraje quiero pensar que nunca hay mala leche entonces hay veces que pitan bien otros mal y hay algunos que nos pitan un poco diferente
8534604 lo importante es que se logr el punto ante un equipo bastante complicado y ante un terreno complicado hay que seguir trabajando ya de cara al pr ximo partido pues no hay tiempo para lamentar nada
8534605 eso va m s all de la voluntad de alg n entrenador es un tema reglamentario porque existen plazos para designar los estadios si se hace en el plazo establecido por la fifa no hay ninguna voluntad de entrenador que lo pueda cuestionar
8534606 descarto en absoluto que se haya hecho por presi n evidentemente si ellos no aceptaban pero los problemas segu an hubi ramos tenido que jugar en nacional
8534607 soy sincero aqu durante el mundial sub 17 del 2004 tuvimos la posici n y la posibilidad de tener c sped sint tico y creo que es muy necesario ante los potreros en que antes se jugaba
8534608 en el nacional lamentablemente mientras est el ipd creo que pensar en un buen mantenimiento es imposible y esto no lo digo por los problemas que tenemos sino que dos a os antes de ponerle c sped sint tico la cancha fue remodelada ntegramente qued hecha una maravilla pero dur s lo seis meses
8534609 como presidente de la federaci n y como peruano creo que en este doblete vamos a lograr los seis puntos y ser la partida para la recuperaci n en las eliminatorias porque casi de inmediato en octubre nos tocar otro doblete de visitantes con lo que se cierra el a o
8534610 no hemos levantado mucho lamentablemente pero vamos paso a paso el equipo est conciente de eso que es lo importante y sabemos que podemos levantar
8534611 estamos tranquilos m s no a gusto por c mo se est jugando pero claro que queremos ganar se juegue bonito feo o regular lo que queremos es ganar y es lo que buscaremos en el pr ximo partido ante pumas
8534612 creo que tuvimos buenas opciones de gol tuvieron buenas atajadas ellos por parte de guillermo ochoa el am rica se par bien y creo que ahora lo que queremos es olvidar este partido rescatar el punto que tenemos hoy y ganar el pr ximo juego para tener tres puntos m s
8534613 en el segundo tiempo se mejor tuvimos muchas m s llegadas tuvimos m s el bal n al ltimo tuvimos varias claras por contragolpe pero creo que lo m s importante es meterlas cosa que nos hizo falta
8534614 el equipo se entrega lucha y da todo en el campo nadie se puede quejar
8534615 el equipo se entrega lucha y da todo en el campo nadie se puede quejar de la entrega los jugadores estos es un responsabilidad m a yo la asumo y reconozco que tenemos un equipo unido que deja todo en el campo los resultados es una responsabilidad del t cnico
8534616 tuvimos m s tiempo el bal n un 85 por ciento del partido tuvimos m s operatividad tenemos la oportunidad de gol que el rival ellos no tuvieron ninguna ni siquiera el gol pero entendemos que el futbol es as
8534617 conforme avanza el tiempo el equipo tiene tantas ganas que pierde el orden y cae en precipitaciones nos sobra entusiasmo
8534618 es mal simo no creo que los merec amos porque el rival no tuvo ninguna llegada nos falt punter a tenemos oportunidad de gol pero ellos tienen mucha gente atr s y no es tan f cil llegar
8534619 que es s lido pero nos falta el gol no tenemos queja de ninguno tenemos llegadas circulaci n de la pelota pero hoy tuvimos un accidente
8534620 nos ha faltado punter a creo que el sistema defensivo es bastante bueno mois s ha tenido muy poco trabajo lo que me preocupa es la tabla de puntuaci n en este momento porque el equipo podr a tener m s
8534621 apelar a los principios estar con las bases el primero que no tiene que enloquecer soy yo y no empezar a hacer cambios dr sticos en la alineaci n hay que mejorar algunas cosas sobre todo el llegar m s acompa ados al gol
8534622 no nos agrada el lugar en el que vamos a estar en la tabla pero no es una crisis de vestidor ni de juego vamos a sumar vamos a insistir y los goles va a caer no nos vamos a volver locos y sigo pensando que vamos a calificar
8534623 fue un buen resultado salimos por el resultado y lo logramos fue un partido muy dif cil con un equipo que juega muy bien al futbol y s nos complic por momentos aunque nosotros tuvimos oportunidades quiz m s claras en el segundo tiempo pero definitivamente s nos cost mucho trabajo
8534624 con el triunfo y aparte la determinaci n y saber a qu est bamos jugando o sea la defensa se mostr muy s lida junto con el conejo y obviamente en los contragolpes que hac amos eran de much simo peligro
8534625 es normal repito es un equipo que juega muy bien al futbol con la pelota la controla de lado a lado sin embargo la defensa mostr s lida y muy bien parada que es lo que se trata de hacer
8534626 mire yo creo que el que tiene m s oportunidades gana se es el futbol yo as lo concibo entonces c mo pues nos presentamos ante el gol m s veces que el rival y yo creo que tuvimos m s oportunidades que ellos m s claras
8534627 obviamente dominaron hasta donde les permitimos dominar la defensa se mostr muy seria muy bien parada repito y nos llevamos el triunfo con un gol pero pudieron haber sido m s
8534628 ellos con el 1 0 en contra se nos echaron encima l gico si te hacen un gol en contra pues vamos a buscar el empate y ellos fue lo que hicieron
8534629 aqu el chiste es hacerlos aguantar y saberlos contragolpear que fue lo que mis muchachos hicieron los supieron controlar y nos dimos tiempo de atacar con certeza que para m pudimos haber metido un par de goles m s
8534630 gustan los tres puntos y repito el no desesperarse jugaron un futbol inteligente cuando hab a que defender hab a que defender y cuando salimos al contragolpe lo hicimos en velocidad sal a bien la defensa tambi n
8534631 o sea fue un embotellamiento lo que hicieron ellos pero no se puede decir que nos apedrearon el rancho porque nosotros ofensivamente nos ve amos quiz m s peligrosos
8534632 es algo amargo porque al ver que est s ganado y todo eso para que al ltimo te metan un gol y que sea el empate pues sabe muy amargo la verdad
8534633 nosotros quer amos la victoria desgraciadamente nos sucedi esto y ahora ya hay que pensar en el siguiente partido
8534634 claro desde el primer tiempo estuvimos ah al ataque pero as es el futbol no supimos mantener la victoria y nos quedamos tristes
8534635 necesitamos ganar agarrar la confianza para eso ya hay que pensar en el partido que sigue para hacerlo
8534636 hemos jugado muy bien los resultados son malos nosotros lo vemos un poco mal porque pudimos haber ganado lamentablemente no se pudo
8534637 fue r spido pero no se jug con mala intenci n
8534638 sin duda ninguno de los dos equipos se favoreci desde la tabla y desde la intenci n porque los dos equipos salieron a buscar el partido el segundo tiempo se hizo todav a m s vibrante y en cuanto al an lisis tuvimos tres opciones muy claras en las que estuvo soberbio ochoa guillermo y ellos nos marcaron entonces tuvimos que correr el partido de atr s
8534639 en el segundo tiempo salvo el comienzo que tuvimos una distracci n a los 15 segundos y que hubiera sido letal el equipo reaccion y m s all de empatar tuvo alguna oportunidad de marcar as como tambi n despu s la tuvo am rica es decir era matar o morir para los dos al final en el balance el empate no nos deja contento a ninguno de los dos pero s rescato la actitud del equipo ahora ya hay que pensar en el siguiente partido que ser contra pumas y que ser muy dif cil
8534640 fue r spido pero no se jug con mala intenci n fue un partido fuerte la cancha muy r pida obviamente blanda y eso a veces hace que haya un poco m s de fricciones pero no se percibi mala intenci n en ninguna jugada
8534641 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
8534642 es muy importante para el club ganar otro t tulo
8534643 es importante para boca y para nosotros los jugadores boca est siempre en la b squeda de t tulos y para m es una satisfacci n muy grande porque he ganado varios con este equipo
8534644 le dedicamos el t tulo a mart n palermo que est pasando un momento dif cil y le decimos que esperamos que regrese al equipo cuanto antes
8534645 ya que ven amos por el resultado al final nos regresamos a casa con un punto lo cual no era lo que busc bamos
8534646 es malo es cierto que quer amos los tres puntos que necesitamos para estar en la pelea de nuestro grupo y seguir en busca de la calificaci n pero pues no se pudo esperamos que se nos d para el pr ximo partido
8534647 ten amos el partido controlado llev bamos un gol hasta ah todo estaba bien pero fallamos en una jugada a bal n parado y otra vez nos hacen el gol
8534648 no supimos ganar porque tuvimos oportunidades claras el equipo jug bien y hay que seguir trabajando para que no nos vuelvan a suceder estas cosas
8534649 adem s de que tambi n hubo un factor en esto que tuvimos un poco en contra al rbitro creo que todos se pudieron haber dado cuenta no hace falta decirlo
8534650 termina siendo bueno porque es un equipo dif cil juega bien al futbol pero lo importante es que el am rica se plant bien tuvo muchas chances terminamos bien el primer tiempo hicimos el gol jugando bien en la segunda parte pudimos haber hecho otro gol pero no sucedi porque el arquero de ellos estuvo bien
8534651 el partido fue muy r spido por la cancha que estaba muy dif cil muy resbalosa pero igual se hizo un buen partido
8534652 nadie puede sentirse orgulloso de esa parte de la historia del reino unido en ir n
8534653 si no qui n a va a resultar m s perjudicado no me cabe duda que el nivel de vida de muchos pa ses europeos se va a ver afectado a largo plazo cuando no tengan suficientes recursos energ ticos
8534654 combatir la crisis con las reservas estrat gicas de petr leo
8534655 deber amos de vender 70 millones de barriles de crudo de nuestra reserva estrat gica de petr leo y reemplazarlos con crudo menos caro lo que en el pasado ha reducido los precios de la gasolina en el plazo de dos semanas
8534656 la reserva estrat gica de petr leo existe para garantizar la seguridad nacional de ee uu y no como una estrategia electoral de obama
8534657 wir k nnen vom toronto district school board vor allem lernen dass die grundlage jeder gelin genden integration die wertsch tzung von vielfalt ist
8534658 auch die systematische aus und fortbildung von lehrkr ften um mit der heterogenit t produktiv umzugehen m ssen wir in deutschland vorantreiben
8534659 im not so surprised to hear some of these hawkish sounds coming from the ecb they are facing after all inflation that is double their target
8534660 the big story continues to be about the euro zone and japan and the disappointment in relative growth people knew the situation in the us wasnt great but they now have to face a deceleration in the euro zone a lot quicker than many had anticipated
8534661 investors are unlikely to come back to the market unless they can see an end to us credit concerns and the global economic slowdown
8534662 chinese corporate earnings present a mixed picture chinas leading banks are producing the highest profits in the global industry but the countrys refiners power producers and property companies are experiencing sharp profit declines
8534663 it might affect the price of medicines but whether it will make medicines affordable is an entirely different issue possible na mas mura pero hindi ibig sabihin ay kaya nang bilhin ng mga mahihirap prices may be cheaper but it does not mean that the poor can afford them
8534664 if the government is sincere in making medicines affordable and accessible they should regulate the medicine industry
8534665 our opportunity this week is to back up essentially and thats something that we havent been able to do for some time
8534666 when you get experiences like last week under your belt it contributes to belief if you use it in the right way if it contributes to an over confidence then it will bite you
8534667 a win would be very special not so much for the history its not something that weve spoken about thats the first ive heard of it
8534668 weve come over here with two games our focus is to win both those games so that would be very special more from the team point of view
8534669 weve obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those
8534670 there is a lot of experience there to help the young guys like myself out which is exactly what you need
8534671 yes you hear the nice things people say about you but i try to take each game as it comes keep training hard and then hope i get picked
8534672 i try and enjoy every moment when i am out there
8534673 the first objective is to get that warriors number 11 shirt again then try to have a positive influence on the team and hopefully play a big part in getting us into the top half of the premiership table
8534674 we all desperately want to get there and we believe we have got the capability to do it
8534675 the challenge cup final created a massive buzz around the club and the city and we want to be a club that is associated with being in finals
8534676 having the exposure to the challenge cup gave us a taste of the type of club we want to become
8534677 we believe we can on our day beat anyone we need to maintain that belief and have that winning mentality every time we step on the pitch
8534678 any trophy going is what we are after its about really believing you are going to win every week
8534679 for me the number of quality wings around in england is really exciting
8534680 knowing everyone in my position is of such a high standard is good because you know week in week out you are going to be playing against some of the best around
8534681 there is nothing more fulfilling than going out knowing you are playing on an important stage and that you have to perform it is something i really look forward to
8534682 i would be lying if i said if i didnt have my sights set on maybe the england saxons squad this season but for now my focus has got to be the club
8534683 the club is really where i see us making us some strides this season i think we can really do some special things and i want to be able to play a big part in it
8534684 it was our last chance to do something special together as that particular u20 squad so it was good to get to the final although a shame to lose it against new zealand
8534685 quite a few of the guys in our squad had played premership rugby and we all agreed it was just as intense the standard was very high it was a really good tournament
8534686 it was also great to play against different styles such as the south africans and the fijians
8534687 i come from a family of five and i grew up living in church point
8534688 i knew i had to go to america because its where all the opportunities are
8534689 record companies now have these 360 deals which means the artist delivers a finished album at their own cost and the labels do the promotion marketing get airplay get your music in the shops etc
8534690 but they demand a cut of just about everything you make which traditionally has been outside the scope of the label deal
8534691 there are so many more people competing for smaller slices of the pie
8534692 but im a really driven person and i have an incredibly dedicated team around me so all in all i feel very positive about it
8534693 i like to think my songs resonate with people on a bunch of different levels
8534694 all my lyrics are autobiographical so people should be able to relate to the stories im trying to tell
8534695 hopefully they also like the melodies enough to tap their feet and sing along in the shower
8534696 weve been writing songs on spec for a number of artists and im happy to say weve landed our first big cut with a pretty big artist on a major label
8534697 i love it here its so much fun although it can be so crazy sometimes
8534698 im definitely a long way from church point but it will always be home hollywood is a great place to work but nothing compares to home
8534699 i just started decorating areas in my own house it evolved then i wanted to do things like house numbers
8534700 people might want to highlight a pretty pot and put one of my tiles above it
8534701 i use ceramic paints and this is what gives them durability
8534702 at those times i think this would be good or that would be nice
8534703 inspiration comes from the beautiful painted tiles of greece and portugal
8534704 and i get inspiration for the florals from some islamic tapestries
8534705 the australiana theme is very popular with tourists but also with sydneysiders who send them to relatives or loved ones overseas
8534706 i might put them together to make a panel the back is marine ply
8534707 a sizeable deck might have six to eight tiles together
8534708 each time i mentioned it my family would say here she goes again
8534709 i have some great art in cupboards which id completely forgotten about
8534710 i will still be taking australian art overseas and promoting it
8534711 ive been there so long its a very big decision
8534712 i hope it will continue as a gallery its been a good gallery

8534726 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8534727 we have to work together again as we did two years ago or the joint venture will have to find its own solution
8534728 i met him at the golden globe three years ago and i just started gushing about how much i loved the show and i think i might have frightened him
8534729 the issues are on the wall now its just a matter of what we will do with them in the next couple of days
8534730 im an actress after all i know how they make things its not like it was a secret peek into a toy shop and now the magic is gone ive seen a couple of episodes since then and enjoyed them
8534731 and i ended up watching a lot more tv than i had for years
8534732 the day we penned the first five pages was so exciting wed been talking about it for years but then one day we just hired a babysitter to take the kids to the museum and sat there and banged stuff out
8534733 with these buildings im trying to go back to the old but incorporate the new also
8534734 this is my stab at a hulu inspired video player
8534735 not married not pregnant didnt have a boob job no botox

8534738 the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace is pleased to endorse the 1st world congress on interventional therapies for type 2 diabetes
8534739 aace recognizes the need for interventions that are proven to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes aace looks forward to participating in this very important scientific meeting which will critically examine the potential role for surgery in treating type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders
8534740 i am excited about the collaboration between endocrinologists and surgeons
8534741 together along with other leading experts in diabetes and public health the congress will examine the emerging role of surgery not only as a therapy for type 2 diabetes but as a means to shed light on the causes of the disease the lessons we are already learning from studying gastrointestinal surgery have tremendous implications for the same future of medical therapies of diabetes
8534742 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future
8534743 teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
8534744 teasing out the agents responsible for the beneficial effects of gastrointestinal surgery on diabetes may lead to new discoveries and provide targets for new medications or even less invasive interventional therapies
8534745 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued
8534746 house builders in particular have been reporting significant reductions in site visits and reservations of new properties since this time last year in spite of a big increase in the use of sales incentives
8534747 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
8534748 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
8534749 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
8534750 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
8534751 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
8534752 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
8534753 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
8534754 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
8534755 preferences for enhancement pharmaceuticals the reluctance to enhance fundamental traits
8534756 grading the states a report on americas mental healthcare system for serious mental illnesses
8534757 we made several improvements in the technique that couldallow us to perform this type of procedure routinely
8534758 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smallertumors performing a robotic partial nephrectomy
8534759 for largertumors however patients would get a very large incision on theirside now we can remove kidneys with cancer through a single three inch incision near the patients belly button
8534760 i thinkthis is going to be a big advance for having to remove theentire kidney because of large kidney tumors
8534761 we think well see the sameadvantages with robotic kidney surgery as we have with roboticprostatectomy
8534762 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeuticapproach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although notrepresenting a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raisesan alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective thancurrently available options
8534763 despite these findings this clinical trial is a smallone and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertensionin adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects ofallopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especiallystevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction makeallopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensivemedications more clinical trials are needed to determine thereproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to thelarger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation thatlowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosedhypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in thepathogenesis of hypertension
8534764 the alcon research institute is proud to recognize the career achievements of the worlds leading researchers in ophthalmology
8534765 the impressive accomplishments and contributions of these current winners to the preservation restoration and enhancement of vision carry on the long standing tradition of excellence in scientific and medical investigation of the many previous award winners
8534766 its well known that when youdrink you get a buzz but a coupleof hours later that initial impact at least is gone
8534767 there is always a verydelicate balance between newly formed cells anddying cells
8534768 its a very active period of thatbalance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then latermelt it back down to acquire a specific shape
8534769 thedigits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
8534770 you have to makepeople aware of the science behind the risk
8534771 we are notsaying that every pregnant woman who drinksthree or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby withbirth defects but it elevates the risk
8534772 todos los sistemas que probamos en nuestra geograf a demostraron ser s lidos unos mejores que otros pero todos buenos

8534774 i wish school days were longer because i cant stand being around my kids
8534775 i was just sitting in the bus close to pool meadow when all of a sudden i saw smoke and i could smell something burning i didnt notice it at first but then people started shouting your hair is on fire
8534776 other people on the bus couldnt believe it one woman ran off the bus in shock
8534777 the men looked at me as if nothing had happened people started looking at them and all they said was what are you looking at
8534778 i didnt say anything to them because i thought they might pull a knife out on me
8534779 i still feel scared now when i got up this morning i broke down and had to call work to tell them i couldnt come in
8534780 people need to be alert when they are on the bus they should be aware who is sitting in front of them and behind them
8534781 theres definitely a very good chance that all of them could stay
8534782 it will be an adjustment but it should be a good thing because the last couple of years i really got worn out toward the end of the season

8534794 i am absolutely over the moon its a great honour
8534795 i didnt even get to put a bet on her she was available at 9 2 but im not really the betting type
8534796 i was delighted with dirk kuyt his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8534797 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8534798 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8534799 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8534800 for the full year we are confident of a good overall performance and we believe the group will deliver double digit earnings growth in line with market expectations
8534801 optimum has leading us sports nutrition brands and an excellent reputation in the sector it represents a key strategic development in the growth of our nutritionals business and is expected to be earnings enhancing from this year
8534802 we expect this business to sustain its improved performance for the second half delivering an overall satisfactory performance for the year
8534803 but due to the short period of time and organisational obstacles in the conversion of the wildparkstadion we unfortunately had to ask the georgian football federation to look for another venue
8534804 with our eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare with one voice here and now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8534805 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8534806 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8534807 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8534808 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8534809 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8534810 his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8534811 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8534812 his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an evermore interdependent world
8534813 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8534814 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8534815 and so my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8534816 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end
8534817 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming now in the end my candidate didnt win but im really proud of the campaign she ran
8534818 im proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for all our children
8534819 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8534820 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8534821 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8534822 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8534823 with our eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare with one voice here and now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8534824 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party

8534842 i should warn you that matters are about to take a turn for the worse at the royal albert hall
8534843 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8534844 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8534845 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8534846 our policy is to improve our schools any way we can
8534847 we support the directions of these reforms and we look forward to working with the commonwealth on the details
8534848 the good thing about the relationship now with the new federal labor government is that we talk to each other
8534849 there will no doubt be a range of discussions over the coming weeks and months to nut out the detail of these important initiatives
8534850 thats something that parents want something students need and thats our policy
8534851 the direction of these changes is completely consistent with the changes that weve already brought in in south australia
8534852 so were very comfortable with the changes we support the broad direction of the reforms
8534853 principles here are quality of performance of teaching staff and we support the highest quality teaching staff that we can get in our schools and managing that performance
8534854 the other principle is one of transparency knowing about the performance of schools and we support that principle
8534855 the commonwealth wants to take the agenda further were more than happy with that
8534856 under premier rann education is in a mess and parents students and teachers are paying the price
8534857 weve increased funding to our schools by 52 per cent during the life of our government
8534858 but people always expect us to spend taxpayer funds in the most efficient way possible so were always trying to economise in the way we use taxpayers dollars
8534859 but the critical thing is we just get more service its being ploughed back into education
8534860 these reforms are consistent with the direction we want to take education
8534861 any sensible plan will allow us to compare likes with likes so were looking at measuring the performance of schools and not the things beyond their control
8534862 with natural resources having already achieved a 10 margin and our other core businesses expected to make strong progress in 2008 we have raised our group margin target for 2010 from 8 to 8 5
8534863 he went through all the tests that he needed to do to make sure that he would be available so ill make a decision nearer the game but he should be okay
8534864 this is an important milestone towards securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger

8534869 who would do this to a helpless elderly male its disturbing to say the least
8534870 great identification of the color of the suspects clothing but what color was the suspect this might be an important clue that can be stated in the paper to help catch the suspect
8534871 we want to fix the shortage instead of creating a situation where hospitals have to shift the nursing workload to lesser trained workers
8534872 its not un doable but its very hard its not something thats going to be taken care of right away
8534873 thousands of qualified students are turned away from nursing programs each year as a result of insufficient faculty
8534874 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8534875 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8534876 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8534877 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8534878 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8534879 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient

8534917 the promise at the beginning of all of this was we stay peaceful they stay peaceful
8534918 through the indications of a lot of things we felt the protesters were getting ready to move down start creating destruction of private property and possibly assaulting people
8534919 im just trying to come in and learn the playbook as fast as i can pick up some of the offense so i can go out there and try to showcase what i can do
8534920 whether it be punt return or offense i just want to contribute to the team
8534921 theres been a little bit of everything as far as picking a team whether its the last game first game
8534922 ive seen guys who dont really play in the preseason make it but its some kind of past performance that you make the decision on you just hope you make the right decisions
8534923 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at a risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
8534924 it makes little sense to promote the development of one area of a city to the detriment of another which is exactly what this idea would do
8534925 the economic health of the neighborhoods that surround downtown such as aycock are sic directly linked to downtown therefore the proposals contained in this plan are important not only for the aycock neighborhood but also for downtown greensboro
8534926 most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be
8534927 and thats the way its gonna be for me the rest of my career at duke
8534928 for the rest of my career im not going to get into that relief thing were going to go after it were going to do it and if somebody doesnt go to the final four during their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8534929 our team is going to have fun and theyre going to have an opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did and just like most of our teams here have done
8534930 doing these two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8534931 theres no way i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for whatever for the kids i coach im a better coach and a better person as a result and i was while i was coaching the devils its just that because we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat some people said shame on you well the people who wrote those things they were wrong
8534932 anything we can do to be a better offensive line we have to do
8534933 it was an experiment and hopefully this one works out the way we think it is
8534934 youre involved in all the calls other than the quarterback you touch the ball every time and youve got to get it to the quarterback
8534935 we were in a position where we had to do something
8534936 ill talk to him sometimes when he does something like step on my feet ill talk to him and hell just get it right the next play after i think hes going to come around real easily during the season
8534937 because its the head of the offensive line theyre putting a lot of trust in me by moving me here
8534938 lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8534942 in its broad sweep and deep engagement with the issues that eventually propelled the nation into civil war the pearl contributes new insights into the antebellum contest over the future of slavery in the nations capital
8534943 had it succeeded it would have sent shock waves throughout the country proving to northerners and southerners alike the vulnerability of the slave system
8534944 even its failure had great import for slavery in the nations capital as southerners clearly recognized
8534945 wonderfully and convincingly illustrates how the decisions of ordinary slaves to resist helped rupture the political fabric of the nation
8534946 1 09 per pound for this duck how come so cheap
8534947 please i want this duck but i just need it cut up you can just divide it into quarters

8534953 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8534954 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8534955 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8534956 in the midst of the georgia crisis i want to re affirm the commitment of the united kingdom to support the democratic choices of the ukrainian people
8534957 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8534958 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8534959 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8534960 i think that the government should be looking at all of the potential mechanisms all of the things in the locker that they have

8534975 starting january this year we have taken all of the systems and issues and we used to have 12 different legal entities within the group and combined them into one central data processing centre
8534976 we have already consulted ibm in the fourth quarter last year to work on a strategic masterplan for us to bring everything together in one central location with the best application and hardware they have
8534977 the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8534978 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8534979 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8534980 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that

8534992 joc has always been against the talks which could result in tsvangirai getting some executive powers remember joc is made up of military commanders who have in the past made it public that they will not allow tsvangirai to be the leader of the country
8534993 immediately after mugabes speech joc members ran around and communicated to each other that this was the right time to pressure mugabe to pull out of the talks
8534994 its not clear if mugabe has heeded their advice but from the way he reacted after parliament it seems he will announce his zanu pf cabinet anytime
8534995 the president is in a quandary he is well aware that he will disappoint mbeki by forming his own government without tsvangirai but as things stand he has little option he is aware more than ever before that he cannot work with the main mdc
8534996 but he might give people like mutambara powerful positions and dump tsvangirais mdc and form a government
8534997 it will be a difficult decision but it looks like there is little he can do at the moment mugabes advisers seem determined and the old man might give in to pressure

8535010 waiter rant thanks for the tip confessions of a cynical waiter
8535011 well most people side with the waiter i think to be honest
8535012 there is an unspoken i wont mess with you and you wont mess with my food you do remember mutually assured destruction
8535013 if you work in a busy place you do have to prioritize ill give you the benefit of the doubt if i dont know you but if you look at the menu and your eyes bulge at the prices bad sign if youre screaming at your husband bad sign i dont want to wait on children i know people who hate waiting on women for whatever reason i suggest you walk in smiling and laughing as it does to anyone else your body language does matter to us
8535014 there are i try to just get my job done to get my table their food the basics i agree no one wants to hear our story but it would be inhumane not to talk at all no
8535015 it means theyre not going to be honest a good waiter will have one dish that they pan there is a weak spot on every menu and it does help with your credibility to identify it ive had managers tell me to move the flounder because its going bad i wont is it my fault your chef ordered too much fish truth is if the meal is bad and its the kitchens fault i feel it in the tip
8535016 understood but everyone thinks a list of specials is a sign of a classy place two specials is fine more youll forget youll ask me if this is written down some place and the thing is ideally everything is special
8535017 i like the food network but people watch these shows and they think they know how a restaurant works now and i dont and ive worked in one for nine years
8535018 well remember that tips spelled backward is spit remember that be polite to us be a human being to us please dont order something thats not on the menu dont order sushi in an italian restaurant if its not on the menu we dont make it the chef is talented but its probably a guy named julio making your food really stick to the menu dont make your own damn food you didnt want to when you left the house thats probably why youre here
8535019 you missed a great one at czech plaza 7016 w cermak rd in berwyn all of the following entrees are less than 10 roasted pork breaded pork tenderloin quarter roasted duck meatloaf and pierogi each comes with homemade bread soup or juice and sides of either potatoes dumplings cabbage or sauerkraut and a dessert add to that their great selection of czech beers and it is definitely nap time when you get home

8535022 little america restaurant 299 w central rd mt prospect is the best deal around unlike most places with good prices and good portions their food is awesome i have been going here for over a decade and everything is great and they have tons of items on their menu you can have a great meal for well under 10 with many options between 5 and 8

8535030 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8535031 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time

8535037 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out

8535040 can the people of a territory constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits
8535041 there can be no moral right in connection with one man making a slave of another
8535042 i always wanted to act i was two years old watching the television and said how do i get that job but my parents didnt want me to
8535043 do what you want to do let nobody stop you and follow your dream
8535044 one of the things that drew me to this script were these ideas floating around that were focused on in the news like terror and the patriots act
8535045 the question for me in this film was how far would you go against what maybe you personally believe in to protect or have a feeling of safety i still think the idea of security is mostly a concept i dont know how were ever really secure even if you put borders around this whole place it just makes it a bigger challenge i dont think that really exists some perfect place of safety
8535046 what ive learned traveling around the world and speaking to a lot of different people is that most people really just kind of want to just get through the day most people really just wanna like make some money protect their family and be happy and be safe
8535047 for whatever particular reasons that leaders want to push and pull us in different directions they use faith and they use politics they use whatever for their own ends their own agendas but for the most part we kind of all want the same things with this film the people i met once they knew the story and we told them what we were doing they were like wow thankfully we have a muslim character who you will show wrestling with those things were trying to come to grips with for a positive result
8535048 no i dont really care about that i mean i really dont its a bit of a grind and its not like the oscars necessarily do anything for your movie anyway nowadays it used to mean something else very prestigious it just kind of doesnt any more
8535049 you know i do remember seeing that written and i did write him downey and said oh so youre the white don huh laughs and he said no youre the black me
8535050 yeah for supreme whiteness and blackness ill play the white him i guess
8535051 definitely it was a long shot to make it in the rap game comin from the west coast you can count most of the big west coast artists on one hand so to me that was a long shot going from doing that to making a movie like this and being accepted you know and kind of being now normal and not such a novelty kind of thing thats a long shot to me
8535052 it definitely was long shot for me im originally from chicago and with my whole family we drove four days and three nights to california to help me with acting i definitely think that was a long shot
8535053 i hope to get to do that they dont necessarily have the funding yet for the movie but to play a rapper would be cool her story was actually amazing to me because after she had gotten pregnant and she couldnt rap any more she really wasnt in the music too much but she made sure in her contract that they would pay for all of her education i thought that was really cool because after everything happened she was still able to get her education and shes like a professor i thought that was really awesome
8535054 im a new yorker laughs i always have those issues and you adopt that from being a new yorker
8535055 yes i do trust people but that was a good question i like to keep it honest
8535056 i mean the logical answer is time and experience but really i think that trust is something that comes from the gut and i think you have to get to that thats me and its probably the worse advice to give people but i think you have to trust people from your gut i dont think its anything specific i dont think its anything tangible i think its a feeling you get i think youre forced when deciding whether to trust someone to rely on your intuition in ways that we probably dont do enough
8535057 universal studios has been so damn good to me because in the chronicles of riddick they gave me this character and although i started as you know in the independent film world they allowed me to write a draft
8535058 in the fast and furious they asked me to go direct a prequel to the prequel which is actually really really cool
8535059 so it was a wonderful experience shooting the movie my point getting back to the question if ive seen the final cut of babylon literally ive spent all night in the editing room havent seen a cut of babylon in six months seven or eight months so i dont know what the hell has happened if youve seen the movie give me some feedback
8535060 when i was a kid you know i always wanted something fast to drive i never thought i could ever afford anything fast to drive so when they give em to me and tell me i can go and beat them up and have some fun in doing it bring it on
8535061 hes unpredictable and its a lot of self sabotage going on with that guy like hes really beats himself up a lot
8535062 mirrors parent company tried to sabotage the film by not letting reviewers see it
8535063 i have to watch them with my husband or someone else
8535064 i mustve have seen the lost boys a hundred times
8535065 any guy who puts a black guy as a president gets my vote you know what im sayin hes ahead of the times
8535066 i think the film is a step in the right direction
8535067 dont bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors try to be better than yourself
8535068 youre not going to fight for a country that doesnt give a damn about you
8535069 mr strahan is gratified with the result and feels his legal position has been vindicated
8535070 he hopes the matter can be resolved amicably going forward in the interests of his children
8535071 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8535072 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8535073 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8535074 though tension prevails the situation has been brought under control in 6 7 out of the 12 blocks of the district
8535075 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8535076 it was a very unusual case the boy had one body but two complete heads
8535077 though tension prevails the situation has been brought under control in 6 7 out of the 12 blocks of the district
8535078 more than 20 lakh people and their houses including a number of townships 242 panchayats and 671 villages which lie along the new course of the river have been inundated
8535079 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8535080 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
8535081 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best
8535082 dont bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors try to be better than yourself
8535083 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible
8535084 honestly i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out
8535085 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out
8535086 be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
8535087 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8535088 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8535089 its not about the book its about the persons commitment to telling the story that is going to inspire and motivate people i want to publish a book that means something and will establish something for you and have a legacy after youre gone she understood that and im grateful that she selected us
8535090 while i was at the new york daily news the music editor at the time only wrote pieces about the stuff that he liked rock n roll and grunge bands and things so i would go to his desk everyday and say youve got all this hip hop and r amp b why dont you give me the cds so he would give me some cds he said why dont you just write some pieces and theyll put you on the mailing list so i started writing music features for the daily news and i interviewed people like queen latifah and ll cool j
8535091 she selected us to publish her book because when i sat down and spoke with her it wasnt oh janet jackson im a big fan
8535092 its not about the book its about the persons commitment to telling the story that is going to inspire and motivate people i want to publish a book that means something and will establish something for you and have a legacy after youre gone she understood that and im grateful that she selected us
8535093 i have a problem with the phrase black publishing and black america were people some of us are descendants of folks who were carried over here on ships and survived years of slavery to get to where we are that says a lot about who we are but more importantly unlike any other group here our stake in america is tremendous and i think its time for us to stop segmenting and segregating our talent theres no such thing as black publishing i have two white authors i happen to be african american its about putting out good product
8535094 if thats what they thought they were getting then theyre going to be in for a surprise because im going to give them a lot more than that
8535095 im more than just a black person i hope they got into business with a person thats really really sharp thats going to bring a lot to the table and sell a lot of books selling of books thats what their business is they dont care if i inspire and motivate i also have to have a strong commitment to sell books
8535096 keep us in the money flow so we can do more and more and more im about to start a foundation im going to have a writers lab and work with the freedom schools and do some stuff there the more support we get the more were going to be able to do and thats what its really about to tap into the energy and the power to really make a difference
8535097 everything evolves you cant just focus on one medium every medium is a stepping stone to the next medium youre going to produce great books youre going to have great movies that come out of them
8535098 were doing great things here and were going to do it to the best of my ability

8535127 the van was carrying policemen and jail staff when it was hit by an explosives laden car which was used in the attack
8535128 ten people mostly police and prison workers were killed in the attack
8535129 when it reached kurram bridge another vehicle standing near exploded
8535130 the jail van fell into the river preliminary investigations show at least nine police personnel were killed
8535131 all the bodies are of police officials who were killed in the attack
8535132 real estate is another sector to watch as it will be impacted significantly because of convergence with ifrs
8535133 it will impact the revenue recognition as only when the property is fully constructed and ownership handed over to a buyer that the revenue can be recorded as per ifrs
8535134 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
8535135 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
8535136 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
8535137 the bone preservation was very bad it was possible to make out the way this person was laying but by great good fortune we found this rather fine jet hairpin by the neck so we can say that it was a wealthy lady who was buried with this and has lay in the dark from perhaps the 4th century these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
8535138 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
8535139 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
8535140 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
8535141 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
8535142 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
8535143 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
8535144 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments
8535145 the computer takes over the laborious parts of the process while leaving the important intuitive decisions to the humans

8535159 this is one of our biggest events of the year

8535161 what we dont have is a way to separate folks who want to get out the upper yard would be a gang free institution
8535162 as evidenced by your work the private history of a campaign that failed you served for some time as a confederate irregular in the civil war how did this experience affect the writing or sentiments expressed in huckleberry finn
8535163 in two weeks we learned more about retreating than the man who invented retreating and in that little time that two weeks the desire to kill people to whom i had not been introduced had passed away so i seceded from the secession the ungetaroundable fact is i was missing in action before a shot was fired some say i was too irregular even for the irregulars no my time in the marion rangers hardened my heart against violence as a means of settling disagreements
8535164 how did your fathers and extended familys occasional ownership of slaves impact your view of the practice and is this revealed in huckleberry finn
8535165 in my schoolboy days i had no aversion to slavery no one arraigned it in my hearing the local papers said nothing against it the local pulpit taught us that god approved it that it was a holy thing and that the doubter need only look in the bible if he wished to settle his mind and the texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure
8535166 when uncle phelps is holding jim in bondage he is preparing a sermon for his sunday services is there some irony here
8535167 its more than irony actually its socratic irony uncle silas sermon is all about acts 17 which everyone knew back then was and god hath made of one blood all nations of men in 1885 that brought a wry smile but when one attempts to foist a truth off on an unsuspecting public through satire one almost always misses ones mark
8535168 it will benefit the community for a very very long time
8535169 and its the largest one time donation ive ever seen
8535170 it fits our purposes better we do not need new schools built what we need is general upkeep

8535172 im doing so much awesome stuff in the gym i want to let it go over to the fight
8535173 theres been a lot of hope going on about how good a fighter i am but i havent been able to show that fighter yet in a real fight
8535174 i helped simon in the corner and aguiar and i exchanged glances after the fight
8535175 he had the audacity to jump into our corner and flex in my face i was ready to take care of business simons a good friend i was looking for redemption for him maybe somewhere down the road
8535176 they both said hell no not just no but hell no
8535177 the thing with gil is that in less than 30 seconds he came right up to me and made me back up to the ropes
8535178 he ran into a check hook and homeboy went down
8535179 it scared me i thought whats going on i never had my legs people were questioning my conditioning i had no balance and i couldnt move because of my eardrum
8535180 in the sixth round i know i still have power
8535181 fighters say it all the time im in the best shape of my life
8535182 ive heard it said that everybody has to evolve or cease to exist so i went home to the mcdermitt indian reservation for a while and trained with my dad dave a little i just wanted him to be with me

8535189 the police the administration police and the general service unit reacted violently to the rejection of the results announced by the electoral commission of kenya eck and in perceived odm strongholds they used live bullets to disperse angry demonstrators resulting in deaths and injuries
8535190 odm made it clear that if president kibaki won the election then it would only be through rigging
8535191 in the rift valley some odm leaders called for the removal of people they referred to as madoadoa outsiders who were perceived to be against mr odinga in the presidential race
8535192 they odm were also advocating the introduction of majimboism in their campaigns which was perceived by some people to mean the forceful eviction of ethnic communities who had settled in odm strongholds
8535193 eck commissioners should also be prosecuted for abuse of office

8535233 i was talking to someone about de la rosa and he said just stop watching the game and enjoy it
8535234 you have to let him paint his own portrait you have to find a way to separate the emotions from letting him try to work his way through things
8535235 he puts himself in situations and puts his foot down and gets out of them earlier he would get more frustrated with each batter
8535236 the impetus has gone out of offsetting people are ignoring it it is too much of a hassle
8535237 agents do not want it on last minute bookings they do not want to ask the client about it
8535238 the offsetting rate is 50 higher on direct bookings than through agents because agents do not want to do it
8535239 they are pushed for time and it is a lot of aggravation most agents have little inclination to explain offsetting to clients
8535240 agents often ask us to deduct these before we produce the invoice clients are not even given the opportunity to consider the option
8535241 i sympathise with agents it is management that is at fault most travel bosses do not treat climate change with the gravity it deserves it is disappointing for an industry responsible for considerable carbon emissions

8535287 tigers walk behind me they are to remind me that im lost but im not afraid
8535288 i think its inevitable twenty20 will be an olympic sport
8535289 the international olympic committee could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics just think about the audiences in the sub continent
8535290 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 is how do we make it work
8535291 we definitely need a carve out period im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change

8535301 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8535302 bound by the dovish attitude of clinton and his advisors

8535311 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8535312 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8535313 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8535314 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8535315 pakistan had approached some countries including india to support the board to fill in the gap left open in pakistans cricket calendar with the postponement of the champions trophy

8535319 there was a major difference in the two results there was a deviation that has certain concoctions which we cant divulge now but will do in due course of time
8535320 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8535321 but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8535322 we have been given a tentative date by ipl they want us to come to india on august 30 but i have replied to them that such a date wasnt possible

8535326 the bottom line is that were trying to capture as many tourist dollars as we can

8535328 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8535329 i was part of vietnam and that was a hoax this iraq expletive is even worse
8535330 the promise at the beginning of all of this was we stay peaceful they stay peaceful
8535331 through the indications of a lot of things we felt the protesters were getting ready to move down start creating destruction of private property and possibly assaulting people

8535335 my great grandmother worked as a maid in the home of william howard taft
8535336 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8535337 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8535338 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8535339 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8535340 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8535341 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8535342 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8535343 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8535344 acma found that the program contained both aggressive coarse language and very coarse language neither of which is permitted in m classified programs the acma statement said
8535345 have confirmed that the very coarse language contained in the program will not be broadcast in any future programs
8535346 you have this paper with provocative conclusions on multiracial identity that was first written in july 2005 being published in this final version in august 2008
8535347 hmm why is this issue suddenly on the national horizon oh right the presidential campaign its hard not to wonder whether theres a larger agenda
8535348 i dont know what their objective was but this is a paper with a surprising number of problems
8535349 theres so much more going on here than what theyre saying that the decisions they make look capricious at a minimum
8535350 among scholars who study multiracial identity i dont think any of us believe in that hypothesis
8535351 its the most controversial take its basically the reason used to keep interracial marriages illegal until the 1960s at best we might use it as a straw man
8535352 you have this assumption that blacks are one monolithic population whites are another monolithic population and multiracials are the monolithic blending between them
8535353 you may be a little slow to acquire language but once you do you find it easier to understand syntax and pronunciation for other languages as well straddling cultures may add risks but if we can address those risks it flips over into a strength
8535354 were talking about mixed identities in the public arena like never before
8535355 over the last 10 years youve had a new prominence of people who identify in fluid and dynamic ways barack obama being just one example
8535356 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8535357 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8535358 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8535359 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8535360 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8535361 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8535362 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8535363 so if like me you believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8535364 has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8535365 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8535366 his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8535367 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8535368 his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an evermore interdependent world
8535369 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8535370 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8535371 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end
8535372 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming now in the end my candidate didnt win but im really proud of the campaign she ran
8535373 im proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for all our children
8535374 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8535375 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8535376 will yall sit down weve got to get on with the show here
8535377 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8535378 im here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for vice presidential nominee joe biden
8535379 the republicans in a few days will elect a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8535380 he loves his country every bit as much as we do
8535381 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8535382 the omani ship held for six months was released last night

8535386 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8535387 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8535388 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8535389 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8535390 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8535391 barry ofarrell has today put political point scoring ahead of the states future he said
8535392 his fiscal irresponsibility and contempt will never be forgiven by the community and does nothing to address the impending lack of electricity capacity
8535393 unsteady on her feet her voice was slurred and her eyes were not focused
8535394 justice dogar is a rightful chief justice and we have to think twice before reinstating the deposed chief justice iftikhar mohammad chaudhry as it will create a constitutional crisis in the country
8535395 i am not propagating any minus one formula reinstatement of deposed judges except justice iftikhar
8535396 if they lawyers want to resolve the issue of reinstatement of judges then they should come and sit with the government otherwise they are free to come out on roads to do politics
8535397 by leaving the past we should move forward and endeavour to achieve the cherished goals of supremacy of constitution democracy and the rule of law
8535398 until the validation of proclamation of nov 3 emergency is set aside by revisiting the apex court judgment it is holding the field leaving no room for the government but to give de fecto recognition to the verdict
8535399 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8535400 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8535401 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8535402 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge

8535413 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8535414 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8535415 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8535416 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent

8535419 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8535420 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8535421 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8535422 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8535423 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8535424 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8535425 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8535427 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8535428 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8535461 leider m ssen wir sie heute von einem extrem ungl cklichen vorfall in kenntnis setzen
8535462 der lernaufwand f r diese klausur ist so hoch wie bei keiner anderen in diesem semester
8535463 aber es ist mir jetzt egal ob er nett ist das hilft mir nicht mehr
8535464 offenbar kam eine ganze reihe wirklich ungl cklicher zuf lle zusammen
8535465 um eine pers nliche entschuldigung von uns zu erm glichen hier besteht auch die m glichkeit ihre ver rgerung zum ausdruck zu bringen
8535466 im ausland ein f rstchen zu hause ein w rstchen
8535467 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire

8535469 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8535470 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8535471 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8535472 those in charge of the sporting side of things want him to continue and ive always wanted to follow the plans of those who really know about these things
8535473 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8535474 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season

8535483 this information suggests that in the time that it has been a class c drug usage levels of cannabis have fallen and so has its strength
8535484 furthermore they call into question the validity of other controversial and publicly criticised government claims regarding drug policy for example the link between cannabis and mental illness or the legitimacy of our current classification system
8535485 unlikely to be an accurate representation of thc in cannabis across the board as not all samples submitted to the fss are routinely analysed for thc content the fss database also does not distinguish between sinsemilla cannabis and imported herbal cannabis

8535492 this information suggests that in the time that it has been a class c drug usage levels of cannabis have fallen and so has its strength

8535590 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
8535591 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
8535592 my message was you took an oath and you dont have to agree or disagree with the law you took an oath to uphold the law
8535593 well leave it to the courts to litigate what the law is but once the courts have ruled if youve taken an oath under the constitution you have to follow your oath
8535594 i personally didnt feel that same sex marriages were marriages if they were civil unions i dont think that would have bothered me but i personally didnt feel they were marriages i just didnt want to be officiating at one of those ceremonies
8535595 massachusetts should not become the las vegas of same sex marriage
8535596 we do not intend to export our marriage confusion to the entire nation
8535597 within hours of the november 18 2003 supreme judicial court decision legalizing gay marriage governor romney publicly denounced the courts ruling and affirmed traditional marriage
8535598 and that was just the beginning of his support for preserving traditional marriage
8535599 governor romney could not have been more public or vocal in his opposition to same sex marriage during his entire tenure as governor
8535600 he did not create same sex marriage that responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the massachusetts supreme judicial court for which chief justice margaret marshall has been pleased to accept full credit and responsibility
8535601 the courts landmark ruling established same sex marriage by judicially redefining the meaning of the word marriage
8535602 this final judicial order in the form of a declaratory judgment on may 17 2004 was what created same sex marriage in massachusetts
8535603 any administrative policies and procedures relative to solemnizing same sex marriages were carried out only as a direct result of the judiciarys final action in goodridge on may 17 2004
8535604 governor romney is pro individual and pro traditional marriage period
8535605 well you know ive not probably been an advocate for him in that position and you know i am going to let him defend himself and i dont want to relive the primary but i think that that was a very unfortunate position that he took in saying that well i cant do anything about it oh yes you can

8535611 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8535612 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8535613 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8535614 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8535615 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8535616 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8535617 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts

8535661 our goal is to ensure we can get individual and businesses of a given community to get acquainted with each other and make the most of the collective resources of the community for instance an individual seeking to buy a new car may find a seller two blocks away if a classifieds website could filter ads based on location this is exactly what allindubai is all about allindubai supports the needs of the community but allowing community members to get acquainted with each other and work collectively to improve their communities
8535662 allindubai intends to generate revenue by means of targeted ads from third parties which will ensure our operational expenses are met in the long term we intend to attract sponsors and perhaps get sections of the website sponsored by interested brands to generate revenue
8535663 we intend to introduce more community oriented projects that will complement allindubai and will probably integrate the functionality to provider greater value to the community

8535686 when i first heard of the new heat exchanger flush system it was another one of those why didnt i think of this moments
8535687 i think my personal favorite feature is that the system allows boat owners during vessels operation to run an instant back flush operation in order to dislodge kelp plastic bags and other debris on any of the raw water intakes
8535688 i want to thank the south carolina department of corrections for allowing us to make this demonstration and applaud them for their recognition of this growing threat to our safety
8535689 cell phones are now considered to be the new cash for inmates prison authorities are helpless in defending themselves and the public against the threat as the 1934 communications act prohibits anyone but the federal government from jamming communication
8535690 the fcc and the ctia the organization representing the cellular providers have said that jamming of cell phones should not be allowed in prisons since there is no way of containing the jamming within the prison walls
8535691 in this demonstration using cellantenna corporations technology we will prove that jamming can be contained and refutes the fcc and ctia claims
8535692 if the hype around privacy gains more credibility more people will hit the private button there is a potential threat here to click through advertising
8535693 she is a fascist piece of trash and she needed to be confronted
8535694 the majority of victims families know 9 11 was an inside job michelle
8535695 i just wanted to find out where the boundaries were i ve found out there aren t any i wanted to be stopped but no one will stop me
8535696 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8535697 shakespeare is all based on beats rhythm and rhyme all things that rappers deal with
8535698 sir ian came to engage with some of the young people they were quite impressed that someone like him took the time it was impressive for them to see him using shakespeare and they tried to see the links between it and what they do that was something that inspired them
8535699 i think what city gateway does is great but if ian mckellen had come to read shakespeare when i was in school i dont think it would have had much of an effect on me
8535700 when i listened to the specials i felt these guys feel the same way i do the frustration of growing up in a council flat i dont know if shakespeare knew anything about council flats
8535701 i think schools should be more active in installing recording studios or buying musical instruments so kids can be more hands on
8535702 this is an amazing resource and the facilities are astonishing
8535703 kids want something to do human beings want activity and if they cant find it within their family or their friends well here theyve got grown up friends i think neighbours like me have a responsibility to show an interest
8535704 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8535705 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8535706 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8535707 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8535708 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8535709 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but thats so weak that we tend to miss it
8535710 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8535711 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth
8535712 shes a beautiful woman you know her hugs are genuine she has those beautiful high cheek bones that we see in models the broad shoulders she had a wide stance her gestures are huge they are very encompassing these things draw us in these are the things we look for otherwise just hand out a memo
8535713 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain ssociated with social interactions
8535714 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to elive re experience and suffer from social pain
8535715 to my knowledge this is the highest price for any slice of the cake sold at auction
8535716 she was very sentimental about the cake she loved the royal family and looked back with great fondness
8535717 it was one of those meetings to help clear up the situation get an understanding of the issues and look for a way forward
8535718 the meeting was mainly to continue to discuss ongoing operations against extremists in the border region and to work together to find better ways to solve those problems
8535719 devastated when informed this morning on set particularly jolene anderson who played his on screen wife
8535720 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8535721 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8535722 very close tight knit group were informed on set and filming was called off for the day she said
8535723 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8535724 the episode that went to air on tuesday was shot some time ago
8535725 jolene was driving yesterday and the car she was driving was hit by a truck a seven spokeswoman said
8535726 she walked away from the accident but is having further x rays today
8535727 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8535728 mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8535729 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8535730 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8535731 i hustled around i had a chance to show my progression for the first time
8535732 alex has done nothing but battle his tail off since hes been here
8535733 its all coming together for him now hes made it into a real competition
8535734 ive been in the program three years im ready to go ive been waiting for this
8535735 since ive been going with the ones the special teams coach has been letting me stay with the linemen and get some work done
8535736 hong kong has a fantastic number of great restaurants here incredible hotels and macau next door is the little las vegas which has had an incredible boom in terms of restaurants
8535737 we hope we can find some very good one star two star and three star places in very small places
8535738 schedulizer is down because cornell has made it prohibitively difficult for us to maintain accurate course information
8535739 weve been talking with david yeh vice president for student and academic services since the end of last semester
8535740 we tried to cooperate as much as possible with them but they made it really difficult the registrar has dropped the ball we dont really have a choice
8535741 we have made our best efforts to work with the university registrar to arrive at an acceptable solution to keep schedulizer running but the registrar has been unresponsive
8535742 we know that many of you depend on schedulizer to schedule your classes and believe us when we say we really really didnt want to do this
8535743 were not helping them do their work thats not our responsibility
8535744 its a commercial company they have resources we did give them an approved location to give them information
8535745 as one of the top colleges im glad we use scheduling software as user friendly and compatible as peoplesoft
8535746 oh my god i didnt get a chance to print my schedule yet im going to cry
8535747 if cornell is responsible for this they have found yet another way to make enrolling in classes more difficult
8535748 please if schedulizer is important to you send an email to the registrar at univreg cornell edu let them know ask them to work with us to bring schedulizer back
8535749 is er dan echt niks wat je kunt laten staan bij de kringloop
8535750 this is the first study to show their parabens accumulation in human tissues it demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours it would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants
8535751 it is welcome additional information and we will want to examine the findings in detail
8535752 i dont care what you do i wouldnt want to be like you
8535753 i see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes i have to turn my head until my darkness goes

8535755 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8535756 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8535757 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8535758 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8535759 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care

8535777 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8535778 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8535779 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8535780 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8535781 unsteady on her feet her voice was slurred and her eyes were not focused
8535782 but change occurs and this is a non points event this is a special event so well move forward with it
8535783 i talked to general manager bill farnsworth and he assured me that all three cars in question were not in the rotation of those that andrew would be driving
8535784 barry ofarrell has today put political point scoring ahead of the states future he said
8535785 his fiscal irresponsibility and contempt will never be forgiven by the community and does nothing to address the impending lack of electricity capacity
8535786 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8535787 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8535788 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8535789 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge
8535790 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8535791 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8535792 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8535793 the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8535794 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8535795 but it was a miss that i hit pretty hard
8535796 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8535797 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8535798 a ccess to philippine facilities is much more important than most judged 12 years ago
8535799 on the matter of us access to military facilities in the philippines the general view of philippine security experts is that for domestic political reasons it would be difficult to give the appearance that the united states is reestablishing its bases in the philippines
8535800 w e are adapting our plans and cooperation of the past to the future those plans do not include any request by the united states for bases in the philippines of the kind that we have had in the past
8535801 is to have the ability to go into a country and have a relationship and have understandings about our ability to land or overfly and to do things that are of mutual benefit to each of us but we dont have any particular plans for permanent bases if thats the kind of thing you mean
8535802 the habitual relationships built through exercises and training is our biggest guarantor of access in time of need
8535803 access over time can develop into habitual use of certain facilities by deployed us forces with the eventual goal of being guaranteed use in a crisis or permission to preposition logistics stocks and other critical material in strategic forward locations
8535804 other methods of positioning such as training rotations can provide a temporary forward position or sustain a long term position without permanent forward unit basing
8535805 include measures to tailor local infrastructure to usaf operations by extending runways improving air traffic control facilities repairing parking aprons and the like
8535806 t he navy counts those ships as providing overseas presence full time even when they are training or simply tied up at the pier
8535807 our posture also includes the many military activities in which we engage around the world this means not only our physical presence in key regions but also our training exercises and operations
8535808 allowing the united states to use the philippines as a supply base for military operations throughout the region
8535809 a cooperative security location can be a tucked away corner of a host countrys civilian airport or a dirt runway somewhere with fuel and mechanical help nearby or a military airport in a friendly country with which we have no formal basing agreement but rather an informal arrangement with private contractors acting as go betweens the united states provides aid to upgrade maintenance facilities thereby helping the host country to better project its own air and naval power in the region at the same time we hold periodic exercises with the host countrys military in which the base is a focus
8535810 we also offer humanitarian help to the surrounding area such civil affairs projects garner positive publicity for our military in the local media the result is a positive diplomatic context for getting the host countrys approval for use of the base when and if we need it
8535811 while host nation support often carries the connotation of basing its role of staging and access is perhaps more critical support for port visits ship repairs overflight rights training areas and opportunities and areas to marshal stage repair and resupply are no less important for both daily us presence in the region and for rapid and flexible crisis response
8535812 they expect under american sovereignty that the wrongs of centuries will be righted tr as monge 36
8535813 represented the new frontier to be pacified conquered and stylized to fit u s political business and ideological interest in new ways guerra 49 puerto ricos strategic location in the caribbean added to the american motive behind obtaining its first colony in history
8535814 imperialism based on racist principles and the inherent superiority of the north american white elite guerra 50
8535815 peace and the anglo saxon civilization had to be imposed on the barbarian races of the world just as it had been on the red man
8535816 guerra 51 the elite would be so consumed by the american ways that they would petition time after time for the island of puerto rico to become a state of the united states
8535817 images of the j baro emerged to signify the elites cultural defiance of colonial mandates and their own implicit disgust with the awkward position in which they found themselves
8535818 image captured in its purest form of all the essences of what it meant to be puerto rican
8535819 marginalization of afro mestizo culture and a glorification of a past system that served no ones interest except that of the oppressors
8535820 need to be passive to prevent change to muffle discontent to strangle dissent
8535821 the cost of foodstuffs and other staples in puerto rico was inflated
8535822 if it came to a choice between survival and political ideals they would probably refuse to bite the hand that fed them
8535823 within fifteen years of taking over the island americans produced such a desire for independence that congress gave the islanders u s citizenship to permanently eliminate their ardent desire for a divorce
8535824 early in 1967 i had gone on the second of the tribunals two fact finding teams to north vietnam the only american and only woman
8535825 schoenman it was said had stood up at a dinner with north vietnamese leaders and rebuked them for thinking of peace he raised his glass in a victory salute no one responded
8535826 gives a vivid portrait of ralph schoenman the american expatriate and russells representative
8535827 schoenman was about thirty a tall man with broad shoulders
8535828 in one closed meeting of the tribunal during our second session in late november in a town called roskilde about twenty miles from copenhagen schoenman announced that russell wanted the tribunal to take an affirmative position on the genocide question one of several questions the tribunal was examining
8535829 the practical question was whether the united states was specifically targeting vietnamese population centers
8535830 sartre disagreed he saw american attacks on population centers as a consequence of the fact that viet cong and north vietnamese combat units often stationed themselves in cities and villages as sartre saw it such attacks were deplorable but nonetheless did not constitute genocide in sartres view one could not use that term without evoking memories of hitlers assault on the jews compared to the holocaust what the united states was doing in vietnam was just fighting an ugly war in an ugly way if the united states was in the wrong he felt that was because its effort to subdue the vietnamese resistance was in itself wrong not because the united states was trying to exterminate the vietnamese people
8535831 oglesby was a great admirer of jean paul sartre who together with simone de beauvoir and vlado sic dedijer a world war ii adjutant of titos and a hero of the yugoslav anti nazi resistance presided over the tribunal schoenman represented lord russell who remained a ghostly figure in wales
8535832 all day long schoenman would say on the one hand things like lord russell says he expects the tribunal to find the united states guilty of genocide where the subtext was that russell was paying for this damned thing and did not want to be unhappy with its findings
8535833 dont expect me to defend lord russells positions because i would not think of speaking for him
8535834 the press and vietnam march july 1963 contains our exchanges with the new york times regarding our documented evidence of u s saturation bombing of the civilian populace and of insidious chemical weapons including gases that explode the pupil of the eye
8535835 a years study of the chemicals sprayed in south vietnam and their effect upon the health of human beings animals and crops
8535836 white arsenic various kinds of arsenite sodium and arsenite calcium lead manganese arsenates dnp and dnc which inflame and eat into human flesh and calcic cyanamide which has seriously affected thousands of the inhabitants of south vietnam with having spread these poisonous chemicals on large and densely populated areas of south vietnam
8535837 napalm bombs and chemicals constitutes and results in atrocities and points to the fact that this is a war of annihilation
8535838 spreading communist propaganda as he in his heart must know
8535839 to announce its structure statement of aims and time table
8535840 the pursuit of genocidal policies including forced labor camps mass burials and other techniques of extermination in the south
8535841 we proclaimed our conviction that terrible crimes were occurring and that we were in possession of evidence of such magnitude that it was essential to investigate the charges of this accusation
8535842 our evidence established that eight million people were placed in barbed wire internment camps by u
8535843 every nine months this destruction is roughly equivalent to the total bombardment of the pacific theater in world war ii it is as if the louvre and the cathedrals had been doused in napalm and pulverized by 1000 pound bombs
8535844 apart from the existential problems between sartre and schoenman this split over the question of genocide was the one serious split among the members of the tribunal in crudest terms russell wanted a guilty verdict on this question but sartre was determined to let the evidence speak for itself and as sartre saw it the evidence did not prove genocide he thought it essential that the tribunal demonstrate its independence by voting to satisfy its own conscience and he had let it be known that he thought russell in the wrong to push north vietnams line
8535845 schoenman didnt seem to care terribly about the quality of the evidence he had already harangued several closed sessions about this and was now doing it again
8535846 lord russell was unhappy to hear of the recent attacks upon him by certain tribunal members
8535847 he is all the more distressed by these attacks in that they are occasioned by large differences within the tribunal on the issue of genocide
8535848 no one has attacked russell said dellinger who acted as the tribunals secretary and occasional peacemaker we simply disagree with him on this question why does he consider disagreement a personal attack
8535849 that is for lord russell to say said schoenman i would not presume to speak for him
8535850 also sitting on the tribunal was the polish historian isaac deutscher author of major biographies of lenin trotsky and stalin
8535851 whether the combination of the crimes imputed to the government of the united states met the general qualification of genocide
8535852 the americans want to show others that guerrilla war does not pay they want to show all the oppressed and the exploited nations that might be tempted to shake off the american yoke by launching a peoples war at first against their own pseudo governments the compradors and the army then against the u
8535853 they do offer an alternative declare you are beaten or we will bomb you back into the stone age
8535854 an act of genocide especially if it is carried out over a period of several years is no less genocide for being blackmail and this is all the more true when as is the case here a good part of the group has been annihilated to force the rest to give in
8535855 in the south the choice is the following villages burned the populace subjected to massive bombing livestock shot vegetation destroyed by defoliants crops ruined by toxic aerosols and everywhere indiscriminate shooting murder rape and looting
8535856 as the armed forces of the united states entrench themselves firmly in vietnam as they intensify the bombing and the massacres as they try to bring laos under their control as they plan the invasion of cambodia there is less and less doubt that the government of the united states despite its hypocritical denials has chosen genocide
8535857 the genocidal intent is implicit in the facts it is necessarily pre meditated the anti guerrilla genocide that our times have produced requires organization military bases a structure of accomplices and budget appropriations therefore its authors must meditate and plan out their act
8535858 when a peasant falls in his rice paddy mowed down by a machine gun every one of us is hit
8535859 this crime carried out every day before the eyes of the world renders all who do not denounce it accomplices of those who commit it so that we are degraded today for our future enslavement
8535860 in this sense imperialist genocide can only become more complete the group that the united states wants to intimidate and terrorize by way of the vietnamese nation is the human group in its entirety
8535861 its just what we need weve been working toward playing this game all offseason
8535862 i dont think that has anything to do with it i thought it was a great time for both of us to play each other other than that no i think it will be a heckuva football game
8535863 for a period of time washington dominated this relationship with oregon and most of the relationships in the northwest
8535864 since then all those programs have improved and washington has been in one of those down cycles
8535865 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8535866 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8535867 or any stage of the life cycle of the salmon
8535868 we remain steadfast in our commitment not to buy gold from any mine that threatens bristol bay and we will continue to urge fellow retailers not to contribute to the destruction of this extraordinarily productive natural resource and the communities that depend upon it by purchasing gold from the proposed pebble mine
8535869 coho fishing is actually pretty decent and i had a friend go out monday and they got their two hatchery coho daily limits by 9 15 a m and theyre nice size fish
8535870 in the commercial fishery they had one up to 17 pounds and in the sport fishery weve seen some around 14 to 15 pounds with the smallest being 8 to 9 pounds those are some really quality sized coho
8535871 the opener could be really good and we had almost 15 000 chinook counted on sunday at bonneville
8535872 the commercial fishery also ended and that means it could start off with a bang
8535873 weather really put a damper on the tuna fishery and we saw nothing out of westport this past week
8535874 the ilwaco folks got out this past weekend and we saw up to seven fish per person on the charter boats the private boats were getting three to five fish per rod and there was quite a bit of effort most are running about 40 miles out
8535875 still good numbers of coho coming in around sekiu so far this week with some guys getting limits and others getting one or two coho per boat
8535876 i went out to fish late last week and we had nine out of 13 coho were clipped hatchery marked fish the average size is 5 to 10 pounds with some up to 13 pounds
8535877 were doing decent on coho from west point to the edmonds area and id say about 60 percent are resident coho but there was a 12 pounder caught on tuesday
8535878 we are trolling cover lots of ground to catch fish but 50 to 90 feet is where theyre concentrated
8535879 at westport it was well over a fish per person average on monday and mostly coho with a few chinook but weather coast wide was horrible on most days of last week
8535880 there should be a few coho in the snohomish system opens sept 1 and id concentrate in the lower end below highway 522 down to lowell
8535881 dont expect it to be good until around the third or fourth week of next month
8535882 theyre doing good on perch in lake sammamish and lake washington plus some squid have moved in at des moines pier
8535883 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8535884 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8535885 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8535886 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8535887 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8535888 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8535889 you gave me 75 percent of the route do you want 75 percent of your paycheck
8535890 with veterans its almost like youre going to a fine restaurant youre going to add one particular ingredient
8535891 the other guys its like 10 things with younger players youre really trying to mold them into what you want them to become

8535956 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8535957 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8535958 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course

8535980 rutgers saved more than 700 000 from reduced expenses associated with the transition of the six varsity sports to club status even after increasing womens athletics scholarships
8535981 arguments that are getting shopworn and more outdated and distant from the people who love this university
8535982 reallocate scholarships from men to women to meet those title ix requirements
8535983 there will be no additional 700 000 there will be no additional 200 000
8535984 a n institution does not need to spend additional money in order to comply with title ix under these circumstances

8535996 most of the details are commercially sensitive but the decision was taken on the basis of an entire package rather than just a financial package
8535997 we were aware that sgr needed to be able to broadcast to as many people in suffolk as the bbc although some of the individuals might not be the same we understand sgr has the ability to cover more people across the whole of the county

8536013 the core idea of millennium villages is that villages of approximately 5 000 people will escape from extreme poverty if they are empowered with proven and practical technologies to improve their farm productivity health education and access to markets
8536014 so far what the japanese government has done is announce the amount
8536015 so were working on the details to decide where we are going to put the new villages
8536016 before we think of the money we must think of the ideas
8536017 before the money can be used we must have the right ideas
8536018 they now understand the value chain and the cost of each component they understand the need for a profit margin
8536019 a year is not a very long time to draw definitive lessons about the millennium villages
8536020 but one can note that when people gain self esteem its possible to produce and build results
8536021 the millennium villages are a concept that the government should push forward strongly
8536022 we have to ensure that the model of the millennium villages becomes rooted in the communities and expand their development at this level

8536028 when i decided to come to this eating disorders therapy group i didnt think it was going to be this hard
8536029 it seems like letting go of these stupid habits ought to be easier
8536030 since youve probably never had an eating disorder i doubt you can understand what its like to fear food enjoy using laxatives and diuretics and wish for anorexia
8536031 im an addict too ive struggled for years with work and approval addiction i attended a recovery group for seven years my addiction nearly killed me ive relapsed and paid the consequences
8536032 but anyone who hasnt had an eating disorder cant possibly understand what were going through
8536033 no its not impossible to change your habits and you must get beyond feeling misunderstood and victimized
8536034 were all addicts to one thing or another everyone can understand to a certain extent everyone feels teased and tempted by their addiction it is terribly hard to change and accepting that is an important part of recovery it may never be easy
8536035 many of my clients are addicted to drugs or alcohol or gambling or sex they dont think its fair either we all come to our addictions through different means
8536036 some have hereditary predispositions others were raised in an environment that fostered a particular addiction some simply began experimenting with a substance or process thinking they were safe and ended up trapped they continued their destructive habits until the habits became more powerful than them but we cant camp on feelings of unfairness were not victims and we must take responsibility for our recovery

8536062 gun factories are very rare and this was a significant criminal operation the mac10 is purely a military weapon it is designed for close combat killing it is quite obvious that the upsurge in crimes involving mac10s can be linked to this factory
8536063 at some of the murder scenes ive been to weve found bullets 25 metres to the right and left

8536098 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8536099 antes de que comiencen sus debates con el senador obama deber a terminar su debate consigo mismo

8536103 everyone is subject to the law even websites and blogs
8536104 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8536105 but when they publish things that are libellous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for skmm to act
8536106 skmm may have briefed the minister on the issue but not me
8536107 i am aware of the issue but it is not under my jurisdiction
8536108 telah datang kepadamu bulan yang diberkati allah telah mewajibkan ke atasmu berpuasa di dalamnya pada bulan itu pintu pintu syurga dibuka pintu pintu neraka ditutup dan para syaitan diikat juga terdapat pada bulan itu satu malam yang lebih baik daripada seribu bulan barangsiapa tidak memperolehi kebaikannya maka dia tidak memperolehi apa apa
8536109 segala amal kebajikan anak adam itu dilipat gandakan pahalanya kepada sepuluh hinggalah ke 700 kali ganda
8536110 kecuali puasa sesungguhnya puasa itu adalah untukku dan aku memberikan balasan pahala kepadanya kerana dia orang yang berpuasa telah meniggalkan syahwat dan makan minumnya kerana aku
8536111 walaupun ia kawasan pilihan raya kecil ia mungkin menjadi satu trend di mana pengundi sudah buat pemikiran hendak perubahan walaupun mereka tidak tahu apa perubahan itu dan tidak menerima pimpinan bn
8536112 ini jelas bahawa kita perlu buat satu perubahan cepat corak daya dan perubahan organisasi kita dan cara kita
8536113 satu yang lebih adil yang tidak berasaskan perkauman yang berdasarkan profil rakyat malaysia yang berbagai bangsa dan agama umno perlu bersedia buat perubahan

8536116 nous lavons emport en 1992 lors dune campagne pendant laquelle les r publicains disaient que j tais trop jeune et trop inexp riment pour devenir commandant en chef
8536117 cela na pas march en 1992 parce que nous tions du bon c t de lhistoire et cela ne marchera pas non plus en 2008 parce que barack obama est du bon c t de lhistoire

8536122 warum in der ffentlichkeit den gesamtschulen ein abitur zweiter klasse unterstellen
8536123 dank an ministerin sommer dass sie die schwierigkeiten an einigen gymnasien und gesamtschulen nicht weiter ignoriert
8536124 die landesregierung hat mit dem neuen schulgesetz alle register gezogen damit gesamtschulen das leben erschwert wird und das gymnasium seinen sonderstatus als elitekaderschule beh lt dass die ergebnisse der zentralen pr fungen die bindende grundschulempfehlung und das g8 den gesamtschulen
8536125 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8536126 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8536127 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8536128 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8536129 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8536130 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8536131 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8536132 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8536133 so if like me you believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8536134 has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8536135 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8536136 his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8536137 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8536138 his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an evermore interdependent world
8536139 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8536140 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8536141 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end
8536142 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming now in the end my candidate didnt win but im really proud of the campaign she ran
8536143 im proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for all our children
8536144 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8536145 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8536146 will yall sit down weve got to get on with the show here
8536147 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8536148 im here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for vice presidential nominee joe biden
8536149 the republicans in a few days will elect a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8536150 he loves his country every bit as much as we do
8536151 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8536152 saya punya musim besar di depan dengan mu dan juga inggris saya ingin tetap fit
8536153 saya pernah cedera dan absen 16 bulan tapi staff medis telah bekerja dengan keras sehingga saya fit dan saya tidak ingin absen lagi berharap saya sudah bisa kembali bermain dan fit untuk sepanjang musim ini
8536154 the reason we have advised you that we cannot post these as billboards is that out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8536155 yes i just started my set no dont stand there watching me waiting for me to finish
8536156 having to find on average an extra 60 a week
8536157 and when people are on an average income of 330 per week in northern ireland at present its easy to see how immediate the problem is
8536158 just looking at those numbers its way too early to call the race
8536159 were not going to finish counting absentee and provisional ballots until sept 5
8536160 is like going to the nba all star game and the opera at the same time
8536161 then my mom told me this is something that not a lot of kids have the opportunity to do
8536162 she said this is going to be part of history and she didnt want me to miss out on seeing it a lot of people said that to me so i finally realized how important it was
8536163 it felt like we were seeing one of our own i know hes not from prince georges but he is prince georges
8536164 you see this individual this american and this african american and its like hes the first person in your class to do something big by having a chance to be president of the united states
8536165 in the early days you hear him and what hes saying makes sense and you sign on you see people responding to his message and people around the world listening to him and you get excited that it can happen
8536166 this whole thing is like going to the nba all star game and the opera at the same time the show is going to be great but just being in the town as this historical event is happening is exciting in itself just witnessing it is exciting
8536167 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and have red sox across my jersey
8536168 its like a playoff game you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game
8536169 it was awesome i didnt think i hit it out
8536170 i thought it was just going in the gap i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us
8536171 we just need everybody to pitch in no ones over there boston trying to be the man
8536172 they know how important it is to get on base and extend the inning and when it counts theyve been getting the big hits its the whole team who came up short tonight
8536173 but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states
8536174 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
8536175 one long adventure the bounty of a young boys life
8536176 a fitful interior struggle trying to raise myself to be a black man in america
8536177 roligt att se hur en medarbetare v xer och utvecklas
8536178 the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8536179 will 2008 also break the standing record low set in 2007 we will know in the next several weeks when the melt season comes to a close
8536180 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8536181 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8536182 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8536183 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8536184 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8536185 john thinks that during the bush years weve made economic progress i think its been abysmal
8536186 whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8536187 or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8536188 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8536189 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8536190 ran a great campaign and she was my choice but now we have a great choice barack obama and theres too much at stake for american to make the wrong choice
8536191 spraying is our last resort but with the number of positive mosquito samplings so high we need to knock that down
8536192 it the spray breaks down very quickly in about a half an hour creating minimal risk of human or animal contact with the pesticide
8536193 the virus could go in a cycle but it is too early to tell
8536194 we just know there is a marked increase this year comparable to 2003
8536195 once again safety comes first when it comes to reopening our beaches
8536196 it went in the ocean but not by accident avalon is truly a victim here
8536197 if anything is floating in the water the waves just bring it right up to the beach
8536198 were talking five out of 80 blocks but were looking at everything just to be safe
8536199 every member of the public works department was working side by side
8536200 our public works crew went through every piece of material and found no medical debris
8536201 its fortunate that they understand and appreciate that well only open a closed beach if were certain it is 100 percent safe
8536202 the day that it was closed my husband was out fishing
8536203 they told us they were closing this part of the beach so we just picked up and went to 40th street
8536204 nggak seperti itu kami berdua sudah sepakat sejak awal kalau masalah pendapatan tidak akan kami persoalkan
8536205 pokoknya apa alasan saya memutuskan ini nanti akan saya beberkan semuanya di persidangan
8536206 tahun ini kita targetkan mencapai 225 000 unit mobil kita mengalami over capacity kapasitas kita hanya 211 000 unit per tahun
8536207 tahun ini kita menargetkan 14 market share dibandingkan tahun lalu yang hanya 12 5
8536208 permasalahan ini harus menjadi perhatian semua pihak karena di tahun 2009 pemerintah mempunyai target yang cukup ambisius untuk bisa menurunkan tingkat pengangguran dan kemiskinan dalam proporsi yang cukup signifikan
8536209 kalau demikian permasalahannya maka pemerintah sudah harus mulai serius menggarap sektor tradeable
8536210 akhirnya sektor industri mampu menyediakan kesempatan kerja yang berkualitas dibandingkan dengan sektor
8536211 iya utang pln banyak nih rp 40 triliun akumulasi dari 2006 sampai hari ini
8536212 mungkin pln harus mengeluarkan l c kecuali kalau pemerintah mau menjamin bayar kalau l c kan mereka pasti bayar
8536213 kita sudah tagih saya cuma mau kita fair treatment aja kalau sama batubara dan supplier lain dia bayar kenapa kita enggak
8536214 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8536215 she is an assembly worker in the mobile phone testing department and she is still working there but she has requested us not to make her name public and we will respect her decision
8536216 apple and foxconn staff have started a joint probe into the incident
8536217 the world cup qualifying match between georgia and the republic of ireland will not take place at the wildparkstadion on september 6th
8536218 this is the result of discussions between karlsruhe sc and the georgian football federation who would gladly have played the match here we would gladly have accommodated them but due to the short notice and organisational issues we unfortunately have asked the gff to look for another venue
8536219 he went through all the tests that he needed to do to make sure that he would be available so ill make a decision nearer the game but he should be okay
8536220 no secrets anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8536221 i cant really give you a definitive answer on daniel cabrera
8536222 the mri came back clean but he is feeling some discomfort in the forearm region so were going to wait to see what im going to do i might have to give him an extra day i might have to switch the rotation in tampa but im going to wait
8536223 i cant say when hes going to pitch or if in fact hes not going to pitch until he plays catch
8536224 all i know is the mri came back and its clean which is good news but until he plays catch and picks up a ball and he tells me and pitching coach rick kranitz how he is i cant say one way or the other
8536225 again things can change a domino effect but it is very quiet right now
8536226 even when you have an off day a lot of times you end up in the game you try to stay mentally ready no matter what
8536227 ive played enough games in my career so that i can jump back in the lineup and play im not too worried about it
8536228 it hasnt been the kind of homestand that we drew up on a blueprint
8536229 we played all very good teams that are all in contention i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8536230 a very simple thing for us is that liz put a zero up in the first inning on six pitches
8536231 i think everybody could take a deep breath and say ok lets play because it has been such a mountain to continue to climb night after night after night
8536232 that was a bullet and when i saw him dive wow
8536233 i think cintron was the player of the game he was supposed to be in the lineup then all of a sudden roberts plays and he killed us
8536234 tikiuosi kad tai jam suteiks pasitik jimo savimi ir leis v l stipriai pasirodyti lenktyn se anks iau jis buvo stiprus manau kad jis susigr ins tai
8536235 im looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back
8536236 rickey robinson and king are linked by this combination of idealism and action an understanding of historical wrongs and the urgent need to redress them
8536237 loved america too much to allow its worst strain of injustice to go unchallenged despite the dangers they faced in doing so and they challenged it in subtle peaceful moral but also provocative and ultimately even revolutionary ways
8536238 and infuse them into the office of the president of the united states
8536239 barack obama has the capacity to hit but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
8536240 platsen s g ut som att vara tagen ur en kinesisk saga
8536241 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
8536242 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8536243 but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8536244 we are delighted with the performance in the second half of fy08 and very pleased to have outperformed our previous guidance
8536245 for the production by the west australian government of all relative correspondence advice and reports
8536246 wiser heads in the federal liberal party have decided not to support the drive coming out of the wa liberal party to completely politicise an independent inquiry
8536247 the terms of reference are very different i think to what the wa liberals would have wanted in the first place
8536248 its clearly a liberal party push or stunt in a state election context to try and make things difficult for the state government of the day and i think people will see it that way
8536249 we are not part of this in that it is not our team it is not the west indies team that will be taking part so digicels rights are not infringed
8536250 they are our sponsors but we disagree on this matter they believe one thing and we believe another but we expect that commonsense will prevail
8536251 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8536252 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8536253 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8536254 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8536255 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8536256 unsteady on her feet her voice was slurred and her eyes were not focused
8536257 acma found that the program contained both aggressive coarse language and very coarse language neither of which is permitted in m classified programs the acma statement said
8536258 have confirmed that the very coarse language contained in the program will not be broadcast in any future programs
8536259 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8536260 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8536261 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8536262 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge
8536263 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
8536264 bring a new type of structure and innovative organizational tactics
8536265 we are both on the same highway heading towards the same destination in two separate lanes
8536266 we want to shine a new light on the genre and disarm some of the negative stigma that surrounds the musical genre
8536267 there are a lot of things that are negative but also positive and this good side is not accentuated
8536268 a thing of beauty is a joy forever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness
8536269 i just need the right thing to do and ill be able to show people how good i am
8536270 if a surfer clicked an ad expecting to find gold plated doorknobs then you better make sure the landing page has just that there is nothing worse than a customer who is ready to buy but cant
8536271 the more clicks you have the less sales you make
8536272 im so proud of this record everybody played out of their skin garret jacknife lee continued his progression from maverick genius to one of the best producers in the world musically lyrically and sonically the best record weve made
8536273 i dont know if theres going to be a second record if anything performing has hindered my songwriting because im used to writing on my own pace at my leisure or while im supposed to be working a proper job i dont really have time to sit down when im not performing im usually really tired and just want to sleep
8536274 jaimerais pr senter une derni re r forme fiscale avant la fin de la l gislature
8536275 mais il ne faut pas prendre de mesure sans budget suffisant la r forme se fera dans le cadre du budget 2009
8536276 la suppression de la tv redevance qui est mon combat actuel aura un impact entre 150 et 160 millions deuros mais cela doit se faire dans le cadre dun quilibre budg taire
8536277 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8536278 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8536279 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8536280 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
8536281 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
8536282 barry ofarrell has today put political point scoring ahead of the states future he said
8536283 his fiscal irresponsibility and contempt will never be forgiven by the community and does nothing to address the impending lack of electricity capacity
8536284 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8536285 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8536286 this is going to get worse and its an extremely dangerous situation
8536287 it is simply impossible to have moldova behave in a similar way to georgia
8536288 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8536289 the british museum is a laboratory of possibility for any creative mind it is filled with objects that reach across time and touch us intimately
8536290 seeing as a child the great head of rameses and the assyrian winged bulls at the british museum was what made me become a sculptor
8536291 its huge it would be one of the single biggest events of the year in this state
8536292 i think a lot of people will applaud her depending on how she handles the hearing and the strength of her decision
8536293 this is jim crow justice this is how they used to do black folks in the south
8536294 some people in the city will be mad but shell score points with the obama campaign and her job approval will soar outside the city of detroit
8536295 shes really trying to facilitate quick closure because of the damage thats being done for democrats electorally
8536296 sen obama and his staff have never talked with the governor about this issue
8536297 its not as politically difficult a decision as one would think
8536298 if the hillary thing is put to bed now its barack and kwame and the governor
8536299 people will be watching and paying attention they understand the difficulties of the decision she has to make
8536300 but they also understand the implications of not doing anything and what it means for michigan
8536301 right now each country is increasing its efforts to counter terrorism and bring domestic stability
8536302 if japan leaves the battle lines it would go completely against the moves of the international community
8536303 the best way to carry out the wishes of mr ito and to show japans role as a peace fostering nation is to lend a helping hand to people in the region who are suffering from poverty and conflict
8536304 okay beam over your vcard ill give you a call tomorrow
8536305 uhm cant beam anything over bluetooth sorry its just for my headset
8536306 i throw business cards into a drawer next to my desk never to be looked at again
8536307 en sus viajes por los peque os planetas de su galaxia se encontr con un ge grafo que anotaba en un gran libro de registro monta as r os y estrellas el principito quiso registrar su flor aquella rosa que hab a dejado en su planeta pero el ge grafo le dijo no registramos flores porque no se pueden tomar como referencia las cosas ef meras y el ge grafo le explic al principito que ef mero quiere decir amenazado de pronta desaparici n cuando el principito escuch esto se entristeci mucho se hab a dado cuenta que su rosa era ef mera
8536308 si alguien ama a una flor de la que no existe m s que un ejemplar entre los millones y millones de estrellas es bastante para que sea feliz cuando mira a las estrellas mi flor est all en alguna parte
8536309 en tu tierra dijo el principito los hombres cultivan cinco mil rosas en un mismo jard n y no encuentran lo que buscan no lo encuentran y sin embargo lo que buscan podr a encontrarse en una sola rosa pero los ojos est n ciegos lo esencial es invisible a los ojos
8536310 he aqu la visita de un admirador pues para los vanidosos los otros hombres son admiradores los vanidosos no oyen sino las alabanzas
8536311 ve y mira nuevamente las rosas comprender s que la tuya es nica en el mundo volver s para decirme adi s y te regalar un secreto he aqu mi secreto lo esencial es invisible a los ojos
8536312 we sell guns no id required no background checks criminals and terrorists welcome
8536313 cities that have useful mass transit always have standing room only
8536314 move your big butts out and offer them your seat
8536315 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8536316 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
8536317 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8536318 no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to its neighbors
8536319 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
8536320 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up
8536321 there is the time for everything timing is everything and this is the time to finally speak up
8536322 the market was turning weaker towards the close after the release of the gdp data
8536323 all men were created equal with unalienable rights among them the right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8536324 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8536325 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8536326 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8536327 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8536328 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8536329 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8536330 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8536331 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8536332 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8536333 a candidate or organization lodges deceptive claims against another candidate
8536334 the declaration of independence one of our most honored documents was largely a set of negative appeals
8536335 about 70 percent of the statements in that famed document were criticisms of the british government
8536336 certainly outstrips modern presidential campaigns in the sheer frequency of attack
8536337 we are breeding a culture in which we are too sensitive to negative words about anybody else
8536338 my right to speak my mind to have a voice to be what some have called opinionated is a right i deeply and profoundly cherish
8536339 my only hope is that one day soon women who have all earned the right to their opinions instead of being called opinionated will be called smart and well informed just like men
8536340 on the rare occasions when a black woman has been a central figure in a presidential campaign its more often been as an object of scorn than of praise
8536341 she made it explicitly clear that the focus of her entire life will be improving conditions for the african american community
8536342 a rich pampered ivy league professional who still whines about her country
8536343 someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more
8536344 its easier to hold on to your own stereotypes and misconceptions it makes you feel justified in your own ignorance thats
8536345 real nice michelle another freaking leftist socialist who was making over 300 grand a year in her vice president chicago hospital job thanks to affirmative action the same hospital that shuns uninsured poor people what a hypocrite typical democrat scumbag
8536346 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8536347 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8536348 the proposed copper mine at rosemont holds the potential for many positive environmental and economic impacts
8536349 faced with the choice between changing ones mind and proving that there is no need to do so almost everyone gets busy on the proof
8536350 microsofts just slapped together a pair of special edition zunes for both the republican and the democratic national conventions and they look pretty damn great
8536351 demonstrate the highest level of commitment to offsetting their carbon footprint from attending the convention
8536352 i have caused a lot of grief for this i am sorry
8536353 just as there are direct victims of drug crime there are also collateral victims the people who live where one drug dealing property can pull the entire neighborhood down
8536354 there are wonderful people here working hard to fix it up we look out for each other
8536355 the d a is about justice and this was an obvious mistake
8536356 trying to get through to anyone there was a nightmare
8536357 prawdzik is seen and in some clips is also heard directing the children to undress and to spread their legs so that their genitals can be seen on tape
8536358 these children all pre pubescent girls were under prawdziks care at the time that she assisted in filming them
8536359 this is an opportunity for people to move in a positive direction
8536360 we are asking for three ps this school year to be present to perform and to be polite
8536361 weve found that when attendance is up on the first day violence is down
8536362 for this one day if we do it right the dropout rate will decrease
8536363 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8536364 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change barack obama will deliver that change
8536365 im pretty sure it was when my sister was at ursuline academy in wilmington delaware and joe was at archmere academy claymont
8536366 closely connected with cities through his leadership on crime issues
8536367 is like 98 percent he brings an open door evaluation of obama to every working family
8536368 i just saw history where hillary clinton released her delegates to obama everyone had tears in their eyes
8536369 basically anyone who was not able to secure a spot in a hotel within downtown denver is forced to take a lengthy trip into the city for events every morning and out of the city from events every evening
8536370 denver is essentially a driving city its sprawling nature is not conducive for an efficient public transportation system
8536371 introducing an environmentally safe cab company would have been both a distinguishing feat for the democratic national convention and a solid investment for the city
8536372 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8536373 i am mindful that only yesterday in birmingham ala our children crying out for brotherhood were answered with fire hoses snarling dogs and even death i am mindful that only yesterday in philadelphia miss young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered
8536374 given the virtual absence of substantive differences between the two democratic rivals its difficult to imagine these core supporters not voting for obama when push comes to shove if it turns out that more than a handful of them dont clinton style feminism will be exposed as an absurdity as opposed to something thats badly out of date
8536375 i would hate to put someone away that wasnt 100 percent
8536376 i dont know all i know is i was innocent i didnt have anything to do with the situation i dont know who had anything to do with it
8536377 our role is still on finding shamari and finding anyone that may have been associated with his disappearance
8536378 the acquittal of tuck on these charges is not going to stop us
8536379 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium
8536380 he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8536381 the plus side is that hell be outside at an event with 75 000 people and it will be an electric atmosphere
8536382 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8536383 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8536384 hes got to get away from just having lofty rhetoric its going to be difficult enough that hes in this stadium where hes going to look like a celebrity already this big rock star with these big broad words
8536385 i think its a photographers dream if the message youre trying to send is hey if 75 000 people in this stadium support this guy why dont you
8536386 while i cant speak for other districts over the last five years there has been a greater emphasis on reporting crimes
8536387 we have always and will continue to emphasize reporting because if we dont know whats going on we wont know how to respond to it
8536388 we feel very confident that other school districts are reporting what they need to report
8536389 with their government they do what they want to do when they want to do it here he has rights over there there are no rights
8536390 defer nonessential travel to yemen the security threat level remains high due to terrorist activities
8536391 im glad he had money because he had to buy his own food if he didnt have any money they would give him vitamins
8536392 i cant write to him i cant talk to him
8536393 his son nasir jr started eighth grade and hes worrying about his dad being in prison in another country for no reason at all
8536394 why did they give him a visa if this happens all the time
8536395 whyd they pick him up the whole thing is just not right and the embassy is giving me the runaround
8536396 people dont understand the seriousness of traveling overseas right now
8536397 yemen is on the hot list of the u s it doesnt make any sense going over there
8536398 a lot of people want to study and practice islam and live in a country where they can speak arabic

8536410 some of the worst cases of racial hatred in the past century involved massive genocide including the millions of jews slaughtered by nazi germany in the holocaust the ethnic genocide waged by the bosnian serbs and the murder of nearly one million tutsi people by the hutu militia in rwanda
8536411 refusing to address these events and others like them erased the credibility of the durban conference
8536412 racial hatred is a great evil and it has adversely affected virtually all countries at one time or another
8536413 not surprisingly the united states and israel withdrew their delegations a few days into the conference
8536414 nothing riles the cndp and the tutsi more than having their cattle stolen

8536425 zu geringer reifendruck kann jedes brems oder auslenkman ver lebensgef hrlich machen
8536426 der bremsweg kann sich dramatisch verl ngern und die haftung in kurven sowie bei aquaplaning ist deutlich schlechter
8536427 nur allzu oft ist ein schwerer unfall die folge besonders dann wenn eine notbremsung mit auslenken auf nasser fahrbahn erforderlich wird
8536428 die tests zeigen deutlich dass zu geringer luftdruck in einem vorderrad nicht nur erh hten kraftstoffverbrauch zur folge hat das k nnen leicht bis zu 0 2 l 100 km sein sondern auch dass die fahreigenschaften sowohl auf trockener als auch auf nasser fahrbahn mit abnehmendem reifendruck immer schlechter werden
8536429 diese gefahr ist vor allem bei pl tzlich notwendigem spurwechsel oder unerwartet enger werdenden kurven gegeben
8536430 vielen fahrzeuglenkern ist auch nicht bewusst dass der richtige reifendruck f r den benzinverbrauch mitentscheidend ist
8536431 bei vier reifen mit 1 bar zu geringem luftdruck muss bei einem kompaktwagen mit einem kraftstoff mehrverbrauch von mindestens 0 3 l 100 km gerechnet werden
8536432 aber was ist das schon im vergleich zur gewonnenen sicherheit
8536433 sterreich ist freund des serbischen volkes und wird demokratische pro europ ische regierung voll unterst tzen
8536434 alle gespr che haben klar gezeigt dass sich die serbische regierung voll und ganz zu dem weg serbiens nach europa bekennt und von allen seiten wurde betont dass serbien bereit ist alle geforderten schritte zu erf llen um die zusammenarbeit mit europa zu verbessern und m glichst rasch den status eines eu beitrittskandidaten zu erhalten
8536435 wir haben vereinbart dass wir uns besonders im bereich der aus und weiterbildung st rker vernetzen wollen gerade auch weil milan markovic in diesem bereich viel verbesserungsbedarf im serbischen system sieht deshalb werden wir mit der serbischen regierung verschiedene kooperationen im bereich der verwaltungsakademie eingehen wo sterreich heute schon sehr gute erfahrungen hat wo wir aber selbst auch gerade ganz konkret an weiteren verbesserungen arbeiten
8536436 alle gespr chspartner haben klar und unmissverst ndlich zum ausdruck gebracht dass die serbische regierung die zukunft serbiens in europa sieht so wurde betont dass man voll mit dem den haager tribunal kooperieren werde die auslieferung radovan karadzics war ein erster sehr gro er und wichtiger schritt ich bin berzeugt dass serbien weitere folgen lassen wird
8536437 die serbische regierung setzt klare schritte nat rlich ist es wichtig dass die entwicklung fortgesetzt wird aber es ist auch wichtig dass europa nun zeigt dass es diese schritte wahrnimmt anerkennt und unterst tzt
8536438 sterreich ist der freund serbiens und soll sich hier auch mit voller kraft f r die serbischen interessen einsetzen wir sollen als t r ffner bei der europ ischen union auftreten denn schon allein die ratifizierung des saa abkommens wird eine massive unterst tzung f r den pro europ ischen kurs der regierung darstellen in serbien diese politischen kr fte st rken und nat rlich auch eine gesellschaftliche entwicklung in gang setzen das muss unser ziel sein denn f r die weitere friedliche entwicklung des westbalkans sind prosperierende demokratische und europ ische regierungen der beste garant

8536481 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8536482 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world
8536483 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8536484 from our point of view this would be absolutely adequate response to what is happening in georgia
8536485 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8536486 considering its actions in the falkland islands which are on the other side of the world

8536515 gestegen brandstofprijzen en economische tegenwind laten de mensen nadenken over het gebruik van de auto
8536516 ik wilde graag begrijpen hoe het kan dat mensen die geen enkel probleem hebben met lezen in het engels niet goed kunnen lezen in hun eigen taal
8536517 als de dominee de bijbel in zijn eigen taal niet goed kan lezen gebruikt hij deze ook niet in de kerk het gevolg is dat de gemeente die vaak slecht of geen engels spreekt het evangelie niet begrijpt
8536518 de jufs en meesters vinden het moeilijk om hun moedertaal te lezen en geven daarom niet van harte les in de taal die kinderen echt begrijpen maar schakelen over op engels dit betekent dat een groot deel van de kinderen pas na vijf of zes jaar basisschool doorheeft waarover het op school gaat
8536519 towards a methodology of transfer reading from the language of wider communication to the first language
8536520 volwassenen lezen vaak zachtjes omdat ze bang zijn dat anderen het horen en dat ze dan worden uitgelachen maar ze moeten gewoon hardop lezen omdat zon klanktaal anders natuurlijk erg moeilijk is gevolg van stillezen is de klank is ongeoefend en de uitspraak slecht
8536521 deze leesmethode stimuleert het gebruik van de bijbel en lesboeken in de eigen taal waardoor de kerkelijke gemeente geestelijk kan groeien en kinderen zich op school beter kunnen ontwikkelen
8536522 dit is voor het bedrijf een manier om aan te geven dat het zelf de goedkoopste is dat klopt echter niet altijd wij willen met onze site de tarieven van prijsvechters inzichtelijk maken

8536526 gereformeerde theologie vereist denkwerk de helderheid van witsius gun ik anderen ook
8536527 witsius staat te boek als een voluit gereformeerd theoloog met een internationale reputatie toch bleek zijn visie op themas als geloof wedergeboorte en rechtvaardiging af te wijken van wat ik dacht dat de gereformeerde theologie hierover zegt en de standpunten waarvan witsius afstand neemt beschouwen velen tegenwoordig juist wel als gereformeerd
8536528 eigenlijk houden de antinomianen maar twee van de drie solas over ze laten het sola fide opgaan in het sola gratia
8536529 de kern van witsius bezwaren tegen de antinomianen is dat zij geen goed onderscheid maken tussen de verwerving en de toepassing van de zaligheid
8536530 de geloofsdaad van de mens kan volgens witsius alleen plaatsvinden als god eerst soeverein de wedergeboorte gewerkt heeft de eerste stap in de orde des heils is altijd het werk van god bovendien heeft de mens voor elke daad de medewerkende genade van de heilige geest nodig deze opvattingen van witsius vind je overigens bij alle vertegenwoordigers van de gereformeerde orthodoxie
8536531 nederlandse gereformeerde theologen in de 17e en 18e eeuw volgden belangstellend de theologische debatten in engeland en bestreden ook zelf de antinomianen in de 19e en 20e eeuw kom je onder nederlandse gereformeerde theologen echter volop antinomiaanse opvattingen tegen
8536532 sinds de publicatie van zijn catechismusverklaring hangt comrie het leerstellig antinomianisme aan
8536533 als je de geschiedenis nagaat kun je niet anders dan vaststellen dat hij daarin is geslaagd volgens comrie is witsius slecht ge nformeerd over de antinomiaanse twisten maar een engelstalige theoloog als thomas halyburton een tijdgenoot van witsius beweert het tegendeel
8536534 als het geloven als onderscheidend criterium tussen schijn en zijn wegvalt kan het twee kanten op voor kuyper betekent het dat hij alle kinderen als wedergeboren beschouwt en de hele gemeente als gods volk voor kersten houdt het in dat hij huiverig is voor de oproep tot het aannemen van christus door het geloof beiden willen het sola gratia veiligstellen maar het sola fide komt bij hen onder druk te staan
8536535 het is zeker waar dat ds kersten het nooit opnam voor de lijdelijkheid toch is daarmee nog niet helder wat dan de functie van het geloven is in de orde des heils witsius gaat daar veel dieper op in dan ds kersten
8536536 witsius maakt onderscheid tussen personen en zaken door niet te reageren op uitspraken maar op theologische posities dat voorkomt vertroebeling van het debat daarbij proef je telkens zijn milde houding hij spreekt beide partijen aan als broeders maar niet ten koste van duidelijkheid over zijn eigen visie vrede wordt niet bereikt met een wapenstilstand maar door broederlijk te overtuigen door de kracht van de waarheid
8536537 due to the demand and limited number of available tickets for the sept 27 game the flyers are in discussions to add a game
8536538 the only reason she did it is because she had a psychotic breakdown this is something that could have happened to anyone

8536548 om mij heen hoorde ik steeds vaker dat bijbelkringen in het wilde weg naar materiaal zochten als ze een bepaald onderwerp wilden behandelen vroeger leverden de mannen en vrouwenbonden schetsen aan en daar deed je het dan mee nu weten mensen eigenlijk niet goed hoe en waar ze moeten zoeken

8536551 h laten we de buren erbij vragen zo gaat dat de stap naar een huiskring is sneller gemaakt dan de stap naar de kerk via een huiskring komen mensen in een gemeente terecht
8536552 een kring die niet in de structuur van de gemeente is ingebed komt soms tegenover de kerkenraad te staan relaties verslechteren terwijl een huiskring juist tot opbouw van de gemeente bedoeld is
8536553 als een leider zich niet in de stof verdiept en telkens dezelfde themas aansnijdt kan er geen verdieping zijn

8536560 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8536561 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8536562 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8536563 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8536564 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8536565 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8536566 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8536594 these kids are having huge parties during the school day
8536595 sometimes they have over 100 kids no area is not involved
8536596 we need to decide whats worth keeping in the classroom and what needs to be abandoned if we are going to prepare students for the 21st century
8536597 we will not confine our children to our learning because they were born for another time
8536598 in the 20th century it was all about memorizing content but today its not just about that its about being able to integrate other skills like critical thinking communication and technology skills
8536599 parents educators and policymakers all know things have changed over the last 50 years and we need a new model in education to match those changes
8536600 this is a project of massive scope but must be approached with minute precision
8536601 we will be analyzing skills more looking at new technology and implementing strategies so kids become self directed learners
8536602 the new division of labor how computers are creating the next job market
8536603 theres no question we want students to get better at basic skills but thats not where all the good jobs will be
8536604 being good at problem solving and complex communication is what is increasingly important
8536605 coach was really wanting me to step up and i just kind of got thrown into the position
8536606 we had a couple guys hurt and thats how i got the point of going to second string so fast
8536607 theyre going to be back soon and theyre going to play i think even when theyre back i wont just be a freshman again i think theyll still consider me to play
8536608 the size and the frame that he has and he hasnt even been in our weight room yet
8536609 its like what everybody would like to have coming of the bus everybody would like a guy as big and strong as he is
8536610 he was one of us he was a local guy for all of those reasons he was a good fit
8536611 oh ill probably have words for him even if they lose
8536612 please hold the line your call is important to us and will be answered shortly you are currently number one in the queue
8536613 well its not non urgent enough to wait until mid september
8536614 im calling on behalf of somebody else and shes asleep right now im not waking her up to ask her that
8536615 i need either the name or the date of birth to book the slot
8536616 well twenty five past nine is the latest ive got do you want it
8536617 residents should be relieved as will commuters and visitors who use the well traveled route
8536618 we expect market conditions in the h2 of 2008 to continues to be favorable and believe we are well placed to build on our first half performance
8536619 this strategic stake is to broaden the network of qnb outside of qatar
8536620 in a country like the uae booming as it is everyone would like to participate in whats going on in the country
8536621 some big name banks would like to come here but they cant get licenses it is better to buy a small bank
8536622 this will give us a very important place in the uae
8536623 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8536624 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8536625 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8536626 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8536627 you dont get anything when you come to these places
8536628 it was scandalous typical of the referees a ridiculous decision
8536629 we played very well im delighted with the players but they didnt deserve the referee spoiling the game for them
8536630 people will think it is sour grapes but we didnt get a decision all night and izak reid is now distraught
8536631 i told the referee but they dont listen any more that is why they need half an hour after the game to get their story together im not saying we would have won it but we would have had a better chance
8536632 always want to be inprivate but there is a trade off
8536633 omdat de chauss e damour ook onder de truiense horeca valt is het niet meer dan normaal om hen erbij te betrekken de truiense caf bazen willen zo aantonen dat het allemaal concurrent vrienden zijn
8536634 the day before i started coaching murray i didnt know him at all
8536635 there was a big age difference and a culture difference
8536636 andy is very argumentative if he feels strongly about something a lot of people in his team gave into him i didnt so we would argue about sports mostly
8536637 he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games i dont play video games
8536638 people expect me to be bitter but im not look around and youll see how many coaches get fired
8536639 we still speak he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to do like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots
8536640 the entire set of radio and or communications functions that occur from the user input to the radio frequency output and vice versa

8536643 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted it will be a really big bonus for us if gareth is here this time next week i will be relieved
8536644 i would have said only a few weeks ago that i was resigned to the fact gareth would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in pre season and when he didnt come with us to malaga because i assumed everything would be done that week
8536645 but as for the future now lets go one step at a time that is what i would be looking at
8536646 i wouldnt want to be rushing anyone into making decisions or asking anyone to do something that no one is really comfortable with
8536647 gareth will have better days for us than at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season build up and all of those things
8536648 i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that one and it was just maybe everything getting to him at the one time including maybe that sharpness and fitness that he is still striving for
8536649 is gareth in the right frame of mind i think he answered that with his performances in the games he has played for us
8536650 i will tell you that we are very keen to try to strengthen our side between now and transfer deadline day
8536651 i am sure i could get one or two in anyway but it is just adding the sort of quality that i would want and that is exactly what i will be trying to do
8536652 am i a fan of milner he was nearly here two years ago he nearly signed two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until anything happens
8536653 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago
8536654 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week
8536655 weve not got players who play for england but so many who go all around the world when these international weeks come up it takes a lot away from our training and preparation
8536656 we know weve got ourselves off the hook but we were not guilty of complacency
8536657 its just that we seemed to lose all our rhythm against a team which scored two quick goals and kept coming with their tails up
8536658 happily we refound our rhythm and got two wonderful goals from jimmy and danny
8536659 we learned a lot of lessons without paying the full price jimmys very disappointed with himself after his second half performance but again hes proved that good players can always come up with something special
8536660 maybe its an unfair result and we should have had a penalty in the first half
8536661 united behind him it all seemed to fall apart at st james park following james milners decision to hand in a transfer request
8536662 there is no reason why a consumer should be obliged to take a triple play offer tv broadband telephony to have access to the orange tv channels

8536667 this is the lead role and i dont have an understudy the things run like lightning i cant risk it
8536668 the induction principle is not valid in fuzzy logic i e we cannot extend such a principle to vague properties
8536669 is a consequence of the fuzzy subset s of axioms if there are formulas
8536670 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8536671 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8536672 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8536673 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8536674 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8536675 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8536676 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8536677 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8536678 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8536679 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8536680 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8536681 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8536682 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8536683 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8536684 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8536685 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8536686 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform

8536689 sb 1601 provides valuable benefits to state annuitants at no cost to the state
8536690 i have been proud to carry this type of legislation for the last few years because it acknowledges the hard work of retired public employees while not putting a strain on the general fund
8536691 thats really for ease of administration the retirees pay for it entirely
8536692 this bill and others for the last few years have simply sought to offer these self funded benefits to state annuitants regardless of which agency they retired from
8536693 the legislation that initiated providing these programs to retirees didnt capture all retirees in state service several legislators have had to go back and bring in the last subsets of state retirees to bring them into the fold

8536702 cas and gaps operations do not care what color of airpower is delivering the weapons
8536703 bomber cas however at the joint cas symposium held at eglin the navy and marine corps were successful in not letting the air force call this by a different name
8536704 if heavy bombers are supporting ground troops in the traditional cas role then a name change for that aspect is not needed

8536717 diems luck held the coup leaders were disorganized and amateurish rather than seize the palace where diem and his brother were barricaded they preferred to talk they also failed to capture the radio stations and other communications centers and failed to set up roadblocks
8536718 american sigint had been surprised by the coup as had american intelligence in general
8536719 in the mad scramble for positioning that followed the viet cong in the nam bo saigon region directed subordinate elements to help soldiers officers and others politicians and security personnel involved in the coup to escape
8536720 were the communists on to something there is no doubt that they were correct in their assessment that the americans were disillusioned with diems failure to select a course of social reform and stick with it
8536721 the formation of the nlf probably marked the final eclipse for any viable independent noncommunist and nationalist alternative to diems rule as far back as the 1930s noncommunist nationalist organizations had essentially been destroyed by the french colonial security surete apparatus

8536734 the use of lists of words including individual names subjects locations et cetera has long been one of the methods used to sort out information of foreign intelligence value from that which is not of interest in the past such lists have been referred to occasionally as watch lists because the lists were used as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable intelligence interest however these lists generally did not contain names of u s citizens or organizations the activity in question is one in which u s names were used systematically as a basis for selecting messages including some between u s citizens when one of the communicants was at a foreign location
8536735 indicating that he was concerned with respect to the propriety of requests for information concerning u s citizens which nsa had received from the fbi and secret service he wrote the following
8536736 until i am able more carefully to assess the effect of keith and other supreme court decisions concerning electronic surveillance upon your current practice of disseminating to the fbi and secret service information acquired by you through electronic devices pursuant to requests from the fbi and secret service it is requested that you immediately curtail the further dissemination of such information to these agencies

8536775 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came on board

8536836 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8536837 hillary has told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8536838 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8536839 conversations around the kitchen table once the kids have gone to bed
8536840 tonight weve seen the passing of control of the democratic party from the clintons to obama and biden
8536841 it was interesting that when obama came on stage he was applauded but the crowd didnt go as wild as it did for the clintons
8536842 mr obama has really put the pressure on himself for tomorrow night
8536843 we are trying to re create good habits more importantly than the tossing the ball im hoping that his thought process is right right now hes frustrated he wants to play
8536844 i was very encouraged by the signs we got while he was pitching this year that said hes going to be ok he just wasnt ready to handle four or five times a week yet
8536845 i hope he understands that you have to keep going through these peaks and valleys
8536846 he doesnt want anybody to think hes just walking out because hes not
8536847 i expected myself to be a much larger contributor to this team than what ive been able to do
8536848 and a lot of that is due to an injury that i suffered before the season even started
8536849 its a fine edged sword getting a guy game shape ready a sprained ankle here or there and a guy is out for three weeks you just try to find the right mix all the way through it its on my mind to do it right
8536850 the last thing you want to do is put kitna back in the game if something happens to danny
8536851 i just dont want to play danny the whole game
8536852 we want to see who can run block not just running the ball but who can do it
8536853 we got battles still going out there and just see guys who can move their feet and get their proper pointing aim and get movement
8536854 there will be guys in there competing for jobs right now
8536855 ive discussed that with general manager dave dombrowski and right now thats a total question mark

8536874 this shows lack of rationale does this mean nehru was irrational
8536875 we have also been contacting infectious disease and infection control specialists from hospitals with experience of large scale norovirus outbreaks to critique actions we have taken so far and identify possible options
8536876 being able to accurately assess the character of those one knows personally and well is no small task
8536877 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8536878 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8536879 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8536880 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing

8536911 the audience numbers are spectacular but what is most satisfying is the enthusiasm with which kiwis all around the country have followed the games on every available platform our olympics coverage was a first class demonstration of tvnzs mission to inspire new zealanders on every screen
8536912 i am immensely proud of the company wide effort across sport news and current affairs digital online and the many other departments often working around the clock to bring the latest olympics action to new zealanders
8536913 this is something new for new zealand television long form interviews in depth one on one and without advertising breaks thats long enough to get beyond the headlines and sound bites and get an insight into what really drives our political leaders
8536914 victoria universitys political science staff have a justified reputation for turning out some of new zealands sharpest leaders and thinkers their insights into what drives the politicians and whats important to new zealand voters will make a significant contribution to the question line
8536915 election 08 leaders on 7 is an opportunity for new zealanders to hear from our potential leaders in an unhurried and thoughtful environment it will be a valuable resource to help voters decide who they want leading the country for the next three years

8536936 there is also a significant norwegian involvement in ensuring the quality of education and training of seafarers in the philippines
8536937 in recent years several maritime schools and maritime training centers have been established with filipino and norwegian principals several bilateral agreements have been made in order to further develop and stengthening the relations between the two countries
8536938 with a substantial order book and an overall positive outlook in our principal businesses the group remains on track to make strong progress in 2008 and to deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2009
8536939 given our financial strength we are turning to new projects which will underpin premiers next phase of growth
8536940 consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of market growth than in the first half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets
8536941 our financial performance has been good in the first half of 2008 our organic growth remains ahead of the wider industry at 8 2 and our strategic progress has been good increasing our footprint in digital and emerging markets and making gains in operational efficiency

8536947 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half as the benefit of all these fundamental actions begin to flow through
8536948 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half
8536949 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8536950 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year

8536998 we dont have numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
8536999 because of the slow growth rate of agave it is especially sensitive to the boom and bust agricultural cycle only played out in a slightly longer cycle

8537104 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8537105 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
8537106 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8537107 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk

8537110 many christians traditionally have voted republican because of their justifiable conviction to protect the lives of the unborn now many younger christians are voting democrat because of their justifiable desire to see our nation the most prosperous in the world address issues of poverty global aid and the environment the problem is many christians vote these convictions but thats largely where their personal involvement in the issues stops are the government leaders we vote for meant to do our job for us if god has given you a heart for the poor or to see a reduction in the number of abortions or to promote peace then your personal focus needs to be on that whether or not the president shares your same values
8537111 what if one day every value christians stand for even religious freedom itself was legislatively removed christians in china and many other parts of the world face this reality every day would it change us dare i say it might actually spur the body of christ here into greater action could it be that the loss of religious freedoms would ultimately be the best thing for american christians because it would cause us to stand on our own two feet rather than relying on the government to legislate our faith and values for us
8537112 christians should be focused on personal action regardless of legislation not just waiting for the right number of supreme court justices to come along
8537113 we need to pray for our leaders and our country but always remember that our leaders and country do not define us we are the generation that will shape the direction culture government and social action will take in the next 50 years its not up to washington its up to us and i say its time we step up and lead the charge but that means with our lives our finances and our actions every day not just nov 4

8537117 dari sisi tahapan demokrasi pemilu 2009 sangat menentukan apakah bangsa indonesia mampu mengonsolidasikan demokrasi dan kemudian maju selangkah menuju negara dengan demokrasi yang matang atau tetap bertahan sebagai negara yang sedang menuju demokrasi
8537118 gugatan akan sistem politik demokrasi akan selalu muncul ketika hak ekonomi sosial dan budaya tidak terpenuhi sementara yang mengedepan hanya hak sipil dan politik sistem politik demokrasi akan selalu memunculkan gugatan saat rakyat tetap melarat pengangguran tetap membengkak rakyat tak memiliki daya beli dan rakyat tak merasakan kehadiran negara ketika berada dalam kesulitan

8537283 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8537284 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8537285 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8537286 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8537287 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8537288 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8537335 to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
8537336 i get a feeling that people are trying to become more individual at the moment and buying secondhand clothes is a way to do that
8537337 there has been exposure of certain high street retailers who have not been clean as they should be in their supply base so if you want cheap clothes and a clean conscience then a charity shop is an obvious route
8537338 for shoppers who love the dig and delve experience of shops like tk maxx there is really not much difference in going to a charity shop it is all about enjoying the experience of finding a bargain
8537339 a certain section of consumers are turning their back on fast fashion and like the idea of recycling
8537340 we are not in that place where charity shops used to be where people come to us because they have no money and nowhere else to go we think we are much more attractive as somewhere where you can find unusual interesting and one off pieces of clothing sales are driven by that and we have put a lot of work into getting better quality and interesting donations
8537341 you can get clothing as cheap or cheaper at supermarkets and value shops
8537342 this end of the market should do well when householders are hard up
8537343 but there is a problem in whether we can find enough quality donations

8537345 this information suggests that in the time that it has been a class c drug usage levels of cannabis have fallen and so has its strength
8537346 furthermore they call into question the validity of other controversial and publicly criticised government claims regarding drug policy for example the link between cannabis and mental illness or the legitimacy of our current classification system
8537347 unlikely to be an accurate representation of thc in cannabis across the board as not all samples submitted to the fss are routinely analysed for thc content the fss database also does not distinguish between sinsemilla cannabis and imported herbal cannabis
8537348 the fss participated in an in depth study of thc content for the home office in partnership with other forensic agencies and this is likely to be more representative of actual cannabis strength

8537365 if it was hillary id vote for her but now i think mccain really gets it obama i just dont think hes been around long enough

8537368 its youth and fresh ideas and eight years of unpleasant things
8537369 maybe its time to have a minority candidate think of countries where the media is so anti u s what will people think of the evil united states if we elect a black president it couldnt hurt our image in the world
8537370 at this point youd think everyone would pretty much have their minds made up but they dont theyre very upset with what bush turned out to be but a lot of people even democrats really dont know what to make of obama
8537371 theres a lot of worry that obama hasnt spent a lot of time on the national stage

8537380 its a betrayal of the racial minorities who are preyed upon by this pathology of hope this belief that youre going to turn your life around with a single bet
8537381 so many democrats who pretended to be opposed to state sponsored gambling turned out to be only against the republicans who were pushing for it now when an african american political leader comes out and legitimizes the exploitation of vulnerable constituencies it gives permission to people who dont need much of a push to dismiss those populations
8537382 the success of our schools disproportionately helps those most in need

8537386 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8537387 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8537388 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8537389 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8537390 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8537391 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis
8537392 they fought and triumphed in many battles beginning when they first bought a home together in san francisco in 1955
8537393 a great loss for me personally and for our entire community
8537394 laid the groundwork for all those who want a life of dignity
8537395 del and phyllis were a loving couple cherished by an entire community they inspired so many young and old
8537396 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it

8537418 its nice to be with him at these events and share it with him
8537419 i guess its one of those things you need results to back it up further if you want the publicity if you want to be out there a bit more
8537420 hopefully for me reaching the third round thats something ive never achieved before
8537421 i definitely feel i have a chance in the next round
8537422 breaking into the top 100 that goal is what kept me going
8537423 i always felt i could do it it was just a matter of time it just took me a little longer than others
8537424 now that thats off my back i can just look ahead and keep working on other things

8537431 underlined the urgent neccesity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8537432 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8537433 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8537434 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states

8537445 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8537446 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful this further proves that any information that my father has about me or the people in my life is internet based and about as accurate as a page six item im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the the camera man at x17

8537462 they want us to reward them for the last eight years with four more years
8537463 there are a few interesting developments taking place in this company one is that this company is increasing its presence in the retail pharma space in the us through acquisition of retail pharma stores they have already acquired three stores and they are scouting for more acquisitions in this space in the us
8537464 secondly this companys major strength is research and they are currently doing clinical trials for oncology drug which they have developed the phase i of clinical trials have already begun and commercialization of this drug will lead to a substantial benefit to the company and the shareholders
8537465 thirdly this company has entered into a tie up with mylan inc for worldwide sales of a drug which they have developed this drug is called glatiramer acetatethe other company which is making and marketing this drug is tava pharmaceuticals of israel this drug is a usd 3 billion drug and teva currently has a monopoly position in this drug now the agreement with the mylan is that mylan will do the clinical trials and they will incur all the expenditure which is involved in the clinical trial for this drug and they will do the regulatory approvals and registration of this drug in the us
8537466 it may so happen that since this drug is going to threaten the monopoly of teva they may try to maybe delay the launch or they may file a suit against natco pharma which may lead to a slight delay but whenever the commercialization of this drug happens it could be a big leap forward for natco pharma
8537467 this company did sales revenues of about 330 crore for fy08 they made a profit after tax of about 42 crore i am talking about the consolidated numbers which means an eps of close to rs 14 at the current price of rs 75 this stock trades at a price to earnings ratio less than 6
8537468 another comforting factor or the margin of safety in this investment is that this company holds a land bank close to 300 acres which is close to the new hyderabad airport this land bank alone is valued at between 250 and 300 crore which is more than the current marketcap of this company which stands at about 200 crore
8537469 so one has a company which is available at reasonable valuation it is growing through the inorganic route by acquiring retail pharma stores in the us there could be a very big trigger it may take two three years for that mylan thing to materialize but as and when it materializes it will lead to a quantum it will basically position natco on a different platform altogether also their strength in the oncology segment and the new drug discovery which is happening so one has a company which is trading at reasonable valuation and one has a good margin of safety also by way of the land bank of 300 acres which the company has so at this price i think the stock merits investment
8537470 before i talk about interlink i would like to give a cautionary statement this stock trades in a z group of bombay stock exchange bse and investors should keep that in mind before they make investment in this stock
8537471 interlink petroleum is its an oil company based in gujarat this company was allotted two fields in the mid 90s these are modhera oil field and baola gas field because of paucity of funds with the promoters the old promoters were never able to exploit these fields commercially both these fields are located in the cambay basin and both are proven fields
8537472 this company has recently seen a change in the management the company recently allotted about 1 2 crore shares to a singapore company called jit sun investments if you dig deep into the jit sun investments and the ownership pattern of this company jit sun investments is owned by a company called ezra holdings limited ezra holdings limited is a company which is listed in singapore they are into oil and gas sector and they provide support services in the oil and gas sector they are into offshore support services and marine services and listed on the singapore stock exchange
8537473 ezra holdings has got revenues of about 220 million singapore dollars they made a profit after tax pat of about 100 million singapore dollars they command a marketcap of about 1 100 million singapore dollars and they came out with an ipo in august 2003 and the current stock price is about 15 times the ipo price so this company in terms of its revenues and profitability as well as in terms of the stock price has seen substantial growth over the last three four years
8537474 what will happen to interlink petroleum after infusion of funds by ezra holdings is that firstly they will be able to commercially exploit the fields which have not been exploited till date maybe we may see commercial production of oil and gas from these two fields second is ezra holdings may use interlink petroleum as a vehicle for increasing their commitment and increasing their business in india the other things which give a lot of confidence about the commitment of ezra holdings towards the indian market is that this company has appointed senior people from the oil and gas industry also the former chairman and managing director of oil and natural gas corporation ongc mr b c bora on the board of this company
8537475 so all in all at this current marketcap of rs 70 crore the stock may look to be overpriced given the revenues which are zero for this company but the way things are happening in this company the fact that they will be able to now exploit their fields which have been allotted to the company also the fact that senior people from ongc and also their former chairman and managing director has joined this company give a lot of confidence about the future of this company
8537476 another thing is the stock has seen a run up over the last week or ten days so rather than buying the stock on circuit maybe investors can keep this at the back of their mind and around rs 30 would be a good level to maybe enter into this stock

8537502 this class action will send a real message to corporate australia and the boardrooms that their disclosure obligations are real and that if they choose to mislead the share market or their investors they take a real risk with their balance sheet by actions such as this
8537503 its a very good result for the thousands of shareholders whose rights we represented in this case
8537504 its a return of about 80 cents in the dollar of their pre interest losses its a very high return in complex commercial litigation like this case

8537513 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8537514 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8537515 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8537516 i think we showed were the better team when we moved the ball around but it wasnt our best game
8537517 we had chances in the second half and didnt score
8537518 but we didnt show all we have i think well do better in the home leg
8537519 im probably more excited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round
8537520 but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches so im happy to be in the third round but im still looking for more
8537521 i have to be realistic in my mind and just be ecstatic to be playing here
8537522 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practicing for singles so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8537523 i felt it was a little bit tough for me to get much rhythm out there
8537524 its ok its going to be good in two days im sure
8537525 after that happened i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal at that moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8537526 that was kind of a turning point in my career last year playing the final of the u s open and i started believing more after the final that i really can win
8537527 i knew it was a matter of time i just needed to work hard and really dedicate myself to it thats what i did i had the best season so far in my career and i have a different approach to the tournament to the grand slams because as a grand slam winner you feel a little relief and you gain much more confidence
8537528 its tough to say about federer because he was already so many years no 1 and winning every grand slam
8537529 and this year was not so great for him maybe hes tired you cant forever be no 1 you know and finish no 1
8537530 i try to keep my confidence on a high level and always be motivated to win
8537531 i had a lot of success but still there is many years to come and if im healthy enough i want to win more grand slams
8537532 i was a little bit disappointed with the way he served the point before
8537533 thats a good strategy during the match but it was almost over he realized it was kind of a mistake
8537534 then it was the biggest mistake of his life when he serves for the t he gets the t
8537535 im not going to go for someone up 6 2 6 2 5 2 it was a bad miss but it was a miss i hit very hard i was excited about the way i was playing but to end like that it was a little disappointing i can understand where he was coming from and i probably would be a little ticked off too
8537536 im not in the best shape for me to play three hours its amazing at this moment because i havent been training
8537537 i come to every grand slam but here you feel special like ive made it here
8537538 i really can do it and ive done it here its an amazing feeling
8537539 lacatus trebuie felicitat pentru ca orice victorie este aducatoare de puncte steaua e avantajata ca pleaca din grupa a treia valorica poate intalni o echipa din urna a doua cu care sa nu piarda si una din a patra pe care sa o invinga trebuie sa fim foarte atenti ca fiecare meci este foarte important steaua si cfr cluj trebuie sa faca minimum patru puncte fiecare pentru a putea spune ca e o participare fructuoasa in liga altfel nu te baga lumea in seama
8537540 were really happy to get a quality player who is also a quality person back to our team especially this time of year
8537541 i look at myself on film and i know im still not the player i was coming out of college
8537542 at the same time i really feel like i can still be the guy i really do
8537543 im sure theres anxiety because guys want to be here and want to play on this team
8537544 they have worked hard and there are a lot of guys that have earned the right to be a part of this team but you can only keep so many guys i think tonight is going to be a big night for a lot of guys
8537545 you are requested to stop any further developments on this land i am also requesting you to send me relevant documents of people who claim this land so that when i come i know whom i will interface
8537546 the position of the church has not changed in standing by the standard of the church which has been on for time our position is not different from the one we took in 1998 which we called resolution 110 it is clearly stated there that in this church as far as we are concerned marriage is between a man and a woman it is clear and we have not changed that position secondly people who have other sexual orientation which is if you have a man who is living with another man and they claimed they are married we cannot accept them to be leaders in this church that is the position of the anglican community and that has not changed
8537547 all we are preaching is that we need moral conversion because we are having people who claimed to be religious but not conscious of the morality to do the right thing so all we need is moral conversion towards doing what is right and through this we would achieve national growth and development
8537548 the improvements they did are not worth anything if you dont put in a farmers market
8537549 its just exciting to finally see the fruits of our labor
8537550 why didnt you just go ahead and do this that or the other
8537551 and all shall be well and all manners of things shall be well etc
8537552 remember these are not our dream houses its okay to just not like it sometimes
8537553 it was important for me to finish this chapter of my life
8537554 its like all of us were all kind of hopeless romantics who want the story to end well weve all been programmed that way from tv and movies everybody wants the happy ending
8537555 when he graduated he could have said see you later but he didnt he never stopped working he never sulked he never moaned
8537556 i felt very strongly he should not play at the end of last year
8537557 he had headaches for quite a while and short term memory loss football is a game and thats his health
8537558 he knows he has talent and i dont mean in an arrogant way
8537559 it was obviously frustrating for him to end the season with a concussion that way
8537560 right before spring ball i said ok listen im going to go for this thing
8537561 and i knew that the odds were stacked up against me even to play chris had finished the year and josh was coming back but ive always loved the competition part of things everything i do i like to finish it
8537562 it has completion percentage attempts plays of 16 yards and more interceptions touchdowns it has everything
8537563 it just depends on how fast he gets his strength back youd love to be able to predict it and say hey we know whats going to happen but theres just no way to know youll see as we go we want him to play and he wants to play
8537564 i think some specific things would be to be more accurate and to get the ball out quickly across the board he has to just continue to improve
8537565 im looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back
8537566 rickey robinson and king are linked by this combination of idealism and action an understanding of historical wrongs and the urgent need to redress them
8537567 loved america too much to allow its worst strain of injustice to go unchallenged despite the dangers they faced in doing so and they challenged it in subtle peaceful moral but also provocative and ultimately even revolutionary ways

8537569 barack obama has the capacity to hit but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
8537570 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8537571 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8537572 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8537573 i am not aware of buddhas comments but if the reports are true i dont agree with it
8537574 i am not a super human being i dont know one yet but certainly im not one i am a normal human being who can fall sick recover who can die and who is fit enough to be president

8537576 we are committed to reaching out to find ways new ways to still better connect with all generations and all segments of society in order to benefit from our countrys diversity

8537578 canada is an ideal place to meet the changes that will put us at the vanguard of policing
8537579 in a lot of countries the police are perceived quite rightly not as an impartial servant of the public interest but the arm of an oppressive segment of society
8537580 diversity is a rich element for the community but it brings challenges in terms of management
8537581 you have to consider very very complex problems when we talk about diversity its not only a police problem its a society problem we have to bring together a lot of people we need the community we need the social worker on the street we need parents
8537582 we have to be more aware of how we are perceived
8537583 build a relationship not just when theres an incident or misunderstanding
8537584 i think the conservatives are facing enough risks in this campaign because basically harpers putting his government on the line with no guarantee of success
8537585 a wild card thats not likely to play in his favour
8537586 there is no valid argument that theres been any cuts whatsoever to the canadian food inspection agency
8537587 este ano n o houve campanha educativa como n o s o obrigados os jovens n o tiram o t tulo de eleitor falta atrativo eles n o s o estimulados ao voto e talvez essa pol tica que est a n o os tranq ilize s uma pesquisa explicaria esse desinteresse pelo voto o que n o bom porque eles n o come am a se preparar para a escolha de bons representantes no futuro

8537589 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8537590 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8537591 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty

8537593 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8537594 for the most part the countries that are going into the arctic right now are co operating

8537596 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terrorism
8537597 momin khawaja was prepared to provide and metaphorically pull the trigger of a very powerful weapon
8537598 momin khawajas commitment to violent jihad was all consuming and not one dimensional
8537599 for him to pretend to be surprised or caught off guard is disingenuous in the extreme
8537600 only a person of good reputation can continue a crime like this
8537601 thats why it is such a significant breach of trust
8537602 we are committed to reaching out to find ways new ways to still better connect with all generations and all segments of society in order to benefit from our countrys diversity

8537620 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8537621 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8537622 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8537623 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8537624 at a time when families and businesses are having to cut back gordon brown is increasing spending on promoting himself and his government
8537625 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8537626 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle

8537628 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8537629 here we go again he just cant resist pushing my buttons
8537630 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8537631 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8537632 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8537633 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8537634 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8537635 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8537636 unglaublich wie er es schafft auch ohne adiletten so auszusehen als h tte er welche an
8537637 die passform seiner anz ge ist defizit r und das kontinuierlich von seiner meist viel zu hellen farbauswahl mal ganz abgesehen
8537638 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8537639 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8537640 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8537641 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8537642 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8537643 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8537644 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8537645 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8537646 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8537647 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8537648 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8537649 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8537650 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8537651 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8537652 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8537653 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8537654 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8537655 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8537656 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8537657 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8537658 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8537659 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8537660 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8537661 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8537662 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8537663 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8537664 i can be as cruel as you fighting fire with fire wood i can be as cruel as you fighting lights with lights

8537666 tout ce que jai appris en huit ans de pr sidence et tout ce que jai accompli depuis aux etats unis et dans le monde mont convaincu que barack obama est lhomme pour ce job
8537667 hillary nous a dit sans quivoque quelle ferait tout ce quelle peut pour faire lire barack obama avec moi a fait deux
8537668 en fait a t il ajout en souriant a en fait 18 millions parce que comme hillary je veux que vous tous qui lavez soutenue votiez pour barack obama en novembre
8537669 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8537670 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8537671 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8537672 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8537678 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8537679 weve experienced tremendous growth with our virtual backup appliance product
8537680 the next step in our evolution was to obtain expansion capital to help us accelerate our leadership position in backup and replication management solutions for virtual environments
8537681 it is obvious to our new investors that we are poised for exceptional growth they were impressed by how many large marquee customers use esxpress to ensure data safety in their enterprises with this capital we will be able to scale our operations to meet the needs of our customers and the marketplace
8537682 we wouldnt be particularly optimistic about fund flows for the rest of the year
8537683 the second half of 2009 will start to see an improvement in market levels and then it will take another 12 to 18 months for investor confidence to recover
8537684 we dont see a significant prospect of a collapse in markets
8537685 upbeat capex readings are unlikely to prevent the rba delivering the much anticipated rate cut next week said michael blythe chief economist at commonwealth bank
8537686 it would take a stick of dynamite to shift market views at the current point the capex data does however fit in with the idea that it will be a reasonably modest and cautious easing cycle
8537687 as long as you are going to be thinking anyway think big
8537688 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8537689 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8537690 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8537691 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8537692 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8537693 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8537694 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8537695 who are open to doing something on the production side
8537696 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8537697 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8537698 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8537699 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8537700 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8537701 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8537702 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8537712 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8537713 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

8537778 this exhibition brings together two giant figures in 20th century american art who portrayed the grandeur of the american west
8537779 georgia okeeffe and ansel adams like many of our great artists drew inspiration from the distinctive natural landscape of the west the smithsonian american art museum is delighted to be a venue for this exhibition that takes a new look at these celebrated artists
8537780 what is fascinating about this exhibition is the opportunity to see how two very different artists with equally strong personalities approached the same subjects

8537797 the important thing is to improve rugby to judge the elvs you have to ask have they made the game better better does not necessarily mean more entertaining if you want entertainment you watch twenty20 cricket we dont want rugby to be twenty20 cricket
8537798 that has to be the judgment line these changes have been made with a view to entertainment not to improving rugby
8537799 the pressure on rugby in australia is to win fans theyre competing directly against aussie rules rugby league and football all three are simple motion games where the ball is always in play to compete the super 14 has become a quick tap motion game the ball is in play a lot but that doesnt create a better game it creates entertainment to the detriment of rugby
8537800 now theres test match cricket and twenty20 cricket but we need to keep test match rugby around the world most people want to watch test rugby there are pockets around the world who want to see twenty20 cricket so lets make twenty12 rugby
8537801 we could have 12 players 20 minutes each way with no scrums or line outs as the game becomes more professional another form of the game could develop sevens hasnt been a success as entertainment it might do well in hong kong and wellington but not around the world you might find another form of the game springs up eventually
8537802 just have a look at what the world cup has done in europe rugby in france is so big now they had four club games with 80 000 crowds last season rugby in france is going through the roof because the world cup was so successful
8537803 watch bath against wasps in january it was one of the best games ive ever seen there were unbelievable skills levels on show it had everything if a game is played well and refereed well then there is nothing wrong with it if you play the game well then it becomes a spectacle
8537804 the most positive thing is that we played a bit better against a team that was really sharp we scored towards the end of the game which means the team was always working really hard
8537805 im also really really pleased that kuyt scored the winning goal his effort is amazing in every game
8537806 for us to have the possibility to be winning trophies is amazing and really important and also in terms of the money
8537807 pepe reina was clearly the key player for us in the first game but we cannot just talk about one player tonight we have to talk about all of them
8537808 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8537809 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle

8537811 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8537812 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8537813 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8537814 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8537815 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8537816 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the in regard to abortion
8537817 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8537818 views of who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8537819 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8537820 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the
8537821 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8537822 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8537823 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8537824 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8537825 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8537826 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8537827 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8537828 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8537829 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8537830 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8537831 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8537832 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8537833 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8537834 i have deep respect and appreciation for the civil rights movement
8537835 but far too many of that generation whove been in office far too long have a sense of entitlement and privilege
8537836 this is someone who is completely disengaged from and invisible in the community
8537837 hes never been elected to the school board or even attended a pta meeting he has no idea how these things really work
8537838 in no other country on earth is my story even possible
8537839 is a normal everyday average father and husband in a normal every day average family
8537840 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
8537841 his biography is attractive to young people but its also whys hes behind with seniors
8537842 i dont see him as being the celebrity that everybodys making him out to be

8537846 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8537847 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8537848 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8537849 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8537850 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8537851 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8537852 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the we need
8537853 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8537854 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8537855 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand

8537857 jag delar din oro inf r det samh lle vi h ller p att skapa jag tycker inte att det r en rimlig utg ngspunkt att staten automatiskt har r tt att vervaka alla sina medborgare och att det r medborgarnas sak att f rklara och f rsvara att man vill ha sitt privatliv i fred i min vision har vi tv rtom ett starkt och r ttss kert skydd den personliga integriteten medan kriminalitet och terrorism i f rsta hand bek mpas genom att bek mpa dess orsaker inte genom att f rs ka f rsvara det ppna samh llet genom att inskr nka den ppenhet som skulle f rsvaras f r mer konkreta politiska st llningstaganden h nvisar jag till v r motion om vervakningssamh llet

8537862 well its very unusual for a company to start work on a site in darwin if they werent intending to go to darwin
8537863 i think now is the time for eric ripper and alan carpenter to fess up and tell the truth
8537864 despite obviously a more difficult environment of increasing costs and maybe some waning demand business spending plans remain very strong and quite resilient
8537865 what we are seeing is the highest levels of sales and profitability in the northern territory and they are two of the most important key indicators for small business and they are higher than any other state or territory
8537866 at the moment businesses across the country have found that staff levels are declining when we asked them why that was most places in australia are saying that is is because they have had to get rid of staff because of the economic climate
8537867 in the northern territory the issue is completely different the issue is still really trying to find staff staff have resigned for other jobs

8537884 khotsos silver medal is worth its weight in gold to south africa
8537885 before the games in athens i competed in europe and on my arrival at the olympic athletes village i heard from the other athletes that the reward would be the same as for the previous olympics in sydney
8537886 i still think its extremely unfair that the medal winners were compensated in 2000 but not in 2004 and again in 2008
8537887 it looks as if the 2004 medal winners were at the wrong olympic games
8537888 to crown it all we won more medals than this years team it makes you think doesnt it

8537892 gerrard will have an operation on thursday on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8537893 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time
8537894 he was playing with pain before and he kept going on wednesday because he knew he was going to see the surgeon on thursday its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8537895 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8537896 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game
8537897 it certainly wont be that easy against boland they are one of those sides that you have to be very accurate against if you want the desired result

8537911 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8537912 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8537913 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8537914 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8537915 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8537916 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8537917 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8537918 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8537919 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8537920 we are going to hope for the best but were preparing for the worst
8537921 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8537922 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8537923 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8537924 i was deciding do i want to have another baby
8537925 thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8537926 if i could dream at all it would be about you and im not ashamed of it

8537929 the first time i said look i cant do this im deeply immersed in my work at auburn
8537930 i really want to be part of that dream i want to stand in solidarity with my family in israel birthright israel is one way american jews can have the opportunity to stand in solidarity with israel
8537931 i did a lot of work with jews in the context of muslims and christians
8537932 young jews are trying to carve out their jewish identities and they are not finding their places in the jewish world but somewhere else
8537933 rabbi brenner brings a glowing sense of jewish excitement to whatever he touches
8537934 he has a broad range of jewish experience and great respect in dealing with people across the spectrum whether politically from right to left or denominationally from chabad to reform he finds commonalities and bridges the gaps in an unusual way
8537935 how has the jewish world changed and how are these young people 18 to 26 seeing the world how do they do jewish when they return from these trips
8537936 i hope as a result of my work well see a flowering of a new generation getting involved in jewish life
8537937 daniel will turn his attention to making sure the vast majority of recent alumni get invited to something within six to eight weeks of their return
8537938 being contacted quickly and with something exciting is a huge logistical piece we are not doing or only doing on a patchwork basis daniel will move to develop national curricula and programs that can travel to wherever people need them whenever they want them
8537939 this is a group i love to work with because they ask really tough questions there are no assumptions with this group
8537940 you really have to be absolutely clear about why someone should like to be jewish birthright israel reaches young people at a stage of intense questioning the jewish community must step up and speak to them
8537941 im heartbroken but ill have to focus all my energy working with birthright
8537942 in my heart im a writer i write for my mental health and my sanity
8537943 the idea was born from the feverish mind of rabbi daniel brenner
8537944 it is what it is it will be what it will be
8537945 it never would have occurred to me to go to israel it wasnt on my radar
8537946 here you have 20 somethings who developmentally are at a point where they are making very key decisions about who they are how they will live jewishly and how they will identify and this is an extraordinary opportunity to reach them
8537947 the federation system and jewish organizations in general have found it challenging to engage many young jews especially the unaffiliated
8537948 we recognized that we needed additional resources in order to reach out to more alumni and offer them a wider variety of opportunities to explore and strengthen their jewish identity and sense of connection to israel and to the jewish people
8537949 people did not recognize that the most important energized young leadership from birthright has already self identified as such
8537950 it is very clear that the role of the local director is to help young jews get connected to what already exists
8537951 we do not want to create a parallel stream of judaism that is inefficient and irresponsible
8537952 there is a sense of urgency and importance to this
8537953 we want to maximize the investment that has already been made
8537954 it is an acknowledgment that from the time we started in 2000 until very recently the amount of energy and money available for birthright follow up was shamefully little
8537955 the number of people who have gone on these trips means that there is a social network of alumni regardless of whether they are involved with existing jewish organizations or not
8537956 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8537957 i was part of vietnam and that was a hoax this iraq expletive is even worse
8537958 the promise at the beginning of all of this was we stay peaceful they stay peaceful
8537959 through the indications of a lot of things we felt the protesters were getting ready to move down start creating destruction of private property and possibly assaulting people

8538178 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8538179 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8538180 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8538181 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8538182 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8538183 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8538184 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8538185 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8538186 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8538187 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid

8538190 barack obama est preparado para liderar estados unidos y restaurar su liderazgo en el mundo barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8538191 hillary se los dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso habla por los dos
8538192 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe les suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8538193 obama nos conducir lejos de la divisi n y el miedo de los ltimos ocho a os y nos devolver la unidad y la esperanza
8538194 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8538195 antes de que comiencen sus debates con el senador obama deber a terminar su debate consigo mismo
8538196 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8538197 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8538198 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8538199 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8538200 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8538201 our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8538202 from the middle east to africa to latin america to central and eastern europe the us administration had failed to use the power of diplomacy
8538203 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8538204 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8538205 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8538206 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8538207 no one works for someone we all just work together
8538208 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8538209 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8538210 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8538211 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8538212 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8538213 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8538214 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8538215 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8538216 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8538217 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8538218 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8538219 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8538220 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8538221 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8538222 we only have scanty information about uhuru highway development limited from our computer data as the file is currently not available
8538223 i dont have time to here all thease thinks and disconnect the line
8538224 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8538225 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8538226 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8538227 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8538228 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8538229 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8538230 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8538231 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8538232 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8538233 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8538234 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8538235 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8538236 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8538237 what is it you say keith its an archie bell amp the drells moment for everyone that toes the mound for the first time
8538238 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8538239 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8538240 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8538241 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8538242 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8538243 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8538244 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8538245 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8538246 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8538247 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8538248 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8538249 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8538250 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8538251 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8538252 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8538253 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8538254 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8538255 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8538256 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8538257 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8538258 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8538259 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8538260 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8538261 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8538262 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8538263 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8538264 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8538265 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8538266 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8538267 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8538268 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8538269 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8538270 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8538271 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8538272 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8538273 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8538274 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8538275 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8538276 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8538277 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8538278 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8538279 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8538280 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8538281 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8538282 when youve done something for 30 years you are certainly going to miss it
8538283 but im going to channel all of the attention to a new position
8538284 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word the fan said trust me anybody would want to go there
8538285 this is what ive been working my whole life for
8538286 i never would have written it this way i guess i went down to clearwater and cleared my mind i got back on track and now im here
8538287 the last time i think i played in the infield was 97 or 98
8538288 but it was a great feeling being at third base
8538289 it probably felt like the little league world series players you forget that you get paid to play the game its almost like we felt like little kids with the excitement in kind of a playoff type atmosphere which is pretty normal when we play the mets
8538290 i think he took us to a good place in the game
8538291 i wanted to go deep into the game but i threw a lot of pitches and fell behind
8538292 right now ive been consumed with this fighting for the job as of now im just going to work hard and do my thing
8538293 dont give up dont ever give up and pat believes in jimmy v too sooner or later its going to work out
8538294 i never remember any point where i felt like man i lost the job today
8538295 if thats what the stats say thats what the stats say
8538296 i came out to practice tuesday and kind of had a slow start so you got to think that could have played a part in it youve just got to get back on the horse and keep working hard
8538297 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it
8538298 we dont see any reason to go beyond this were not going to have seven hour games
8538299 i need to see him be better than he was last week
8538300 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8538301 theyre asking me to pick it up fast and im going to go as hard as i can but its somewhat of an experiment and its not guaranteed to work out
8538302 thats like me asking you how long it would take you to be an astronaut
8538303 if somebody hasnt practiced at something you can only expect them to do what you ask them to do and go 100 percent ive been there a week and a half so if i was comfortable there would be no point in going to camp for as long as we go to camp
8538304 we do that so people can practice a position and get better at it if a guy can just step in and be ready to go after a week then they wouldnt practice guys as hard as they do and wed save a lot of bodies
8538305 ive been here long enough and i havent been here long to know that you cant let anything surprise you i tell people all the time that i have the kind of job where i can come in and i might not have a job so being moved to a different position doesnt surprise me at all
8538306 i think its going to go down to the end
8538307 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8538308 when weve got our bullpen healthy and organized i think we definitely have a little bit of a better bullpen
8538309 im down there for a reason to be used whenever charlie wants me to be used
8538310 i know down the road i need to be ready to do that get an out or two in the eighth at the end of the season these are big games so ill make sure im ready to go in whenever im asked to
8538311 you can feel the energy building were all trying to get a win our first win in 48 years its a really big event
8538312 the best analogy i see is if you think about what happened at rutgers their football program started winning and their popularity soared
8538313 we want our name out there we are an excellent academic institution and through football we can get our name out there and tell our academic story
8538314 the way we view it is to provide additional opportunities for young people to enhance their college life
8538315 in a first year theres always a ton of teaching
8538316 its a two year process as far as the offense and defense and techniques and everything from an organizational standpoint because everything is the first time its new to everybody
8538317 i felt like i had to be a part of this
8538318 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8538319 like i told the guys im tired of talking they understand the expectations and what i want for these guys is some success because of what theyve been through
8538320 hes more than ready to lead our team right now
8538321 i dont know who is going to start but you might see all four of them in the opener
8538322 learning from what we did last year were going to be a lot better
8538323 oh thats easy white sox you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side
8538324 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8538325 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8538326 id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am
8538327 i really want everything to work out i want everything to go as smooth as possible but on that way over to the stadium ill just be real real excited because this is a dream come true
8538328 i dont know how hes going to react to this ill probably know how it is in the hotel on friday
8538329 i completely understand ive been there i hope it doesnt turn out to be him being so disappointed that he doesnt want to be cool with me anymore
8538330 we were pretty good friends before and i think that we will still be
8538331 lets be honest there are people on the team that want him in
8538332 there are people on the team that want me in who i dont know
8538333 when theres an all out quarterback competition like that guys in the locker room are going to start to identify with somebody more than the other
8538334 i thought that was really important because that let me know how much confidence that he had in me to run a successful offense
8538335 my mother always told me that the ones with the most patience are the ones that benefit the most

8538343 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8538344 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8538345 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8538346 i appreciate the winners check and all of your support
8538347 we just keep it moving as much as we can
8538348 and its getting closer to the game maybe thats why thursday is so long
8538349 then someones going to key on it so i have to change things up show people different things and mess around with stuff
8538350 i pretty much know where im going to be so i can mess with a guy

8538352 the way i see it the real long term problem facing markets with significant amounts of holiday properties is going to rear its head when retiring baby boomers start dying off lots of people croaking plus very few in a position to buy their second homes potential problems worthy of further analysis
8538353 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play

8538357 pakistan had approached some countries including india to support the board in organising a triangular or quadrangular tournament in south africa to fill in the gap left open in pakistans cricket calender with the postponement of the champions trophy
8538358 now the modalities including venues and dates for the tri series is being worked out but tentatively it should start from september 12
8538359 we are not going to adopt a tit for tat policy because the decision to postpone champions trophy was in the end unanimous people dont realise that pakistan has still got the hosting rights and it was because of strong stand taken by some boards that the tournament was not relocated to sri lanka
8538360 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8538361 actions detrimental to stock car racing hitting another competitors car after the race had concluded
8538362 charge to compensate the company for rapid increases in energy expenses fuel expenses associated with network maintenance and higher related wholesale costs
8538363 if it were an electricity company or a shipper like ups i would understand
8538364 but a telephone company especially a clec competitive local exchange carrier which rents facilities from verizon does not have such extensive energy costs i feel betrayed as a customer
8538365 exterminators charging extra for gas to come to your house it has happened to me
8538366 the question that has been raised to us is if this fuel service charge is being added to bills for state services
8538367 there is no such charge in marylands approved intrastate tariff with cavalier we will invite them to come and explain to the commission to which services they are attaching this fuel service
8538368 thats among the things well be looking to clarify when we invite the company in to explain this to us
8538369 the charge is applied on a per account level for accounts that have interstate and or non regulated services
8538370 the customers invoice does include a bill announcement which indicates for full description of changes to erc see www cavtel com

8538377 im here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden i looooooooove joe biden and america will too
8538378 im really proud of the campaign she ran proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for
8538379 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama and that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november heres why
8538380 but the thing is to try to be good mentally and physically because i think i am playing good tennis
8538381 the first round always is difficult and hopefully next round i play much better
8538382 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8538383 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8538384 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense it s not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signalling at dawn and dusk
8538385 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8538386 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8538387 all of these behaviors are displays of physical vigor as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8538388 since the first cases of hiv surfaced in the late 1970s and early 80s there has been no cure for the hiv pandemic

8538391 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be

8538408 we were both really tired i think where i lost it is the first three games of the third set
8538409 i was down all the time but i felt i could win it i wasnt serving well in the first set and it made a big difference

8538411 that was the reason i was lying there without moving i was just trying to come back to the normal position where i can just stand up and regroup again
8538412 if shes angry at me for going down if shes angry because i didnt see her lifting her arm you can keep going with all these things that happen in the match but all of the players we all try our best to win the match and a win is the most important thing

8538490 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8538491 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8538492 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8538493 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8538494 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8538495 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8538496 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8538497 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8538498 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8538499 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8538513 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8538514 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8538515 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8538516 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8538517 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8538518 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8538519 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8538520 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8538521 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8538522 like it or not there will always be more of everything
8538523 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8538524 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country

8538558 non ci faremo prendere dal panico sottolinea il general manager chris mullin monta in passato ha dimostrato di saper bruciare le tappe nella rieducazione post infortuni per cui siamo ottimisti certo questa non una bella notizia per noi
8538559 i will choose to share think the world of you lisa you know that
8538560 i wouldnt want to do anything different you have been my best buddy on the show
8538561 that is honestly the first time ive been asked that question i am getting married and having children today brad
8538562 ive definitely thought some bb relationships were formed just for the publicity
8538563 im not going to single anybody out but you could think well theyre going to make a lot of money out of being in a magazine
8538564 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay she shouldnt be dragging lindsay around nightclubs
8538565 who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody she is using her for her own gain
8538566 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8538567 nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the worlds poor countries
8538568 are mostly poor countries with high birth rates and low life expectancies on the other side are mostly wealthy countries with low birth rates and rapid aging
8538569 we are encouraged by the leadership you have provided not only for your country but africa
8538570 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8538571 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8538572 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8538573 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8538574 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8538575 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8538576 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8538577 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8538578 now after six long years the administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8538579 i love this but we have important work to do tonight
8538580 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8538581 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8538582 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8538583 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8538584 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be the commander in chief sound familiar
8538585 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8538586 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8538587 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8538588 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8538589 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8538590 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8538591 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8538592 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8538593 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8538594 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8538595 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8538596 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8538597 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8538598 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it
8538599 i would very much urge my side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle to provide an affirmative vote
8538600 obama would not be where he is or even close without that 2004 keynote
8538601 words that shook the world 100 years of unforgettable speeches and events
8538602 then of course when we came out and started marching there were all of these people coming from every corner of the country
8538603 will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood
8538604 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8538605 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8538606 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8538607 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8538608 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8538609 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8538610 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back
8538611 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8538612 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8538613 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8538614 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8538615 post convention florida should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8538616 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8538617 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8538618 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8538619 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8538620 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8538621 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8538622 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8538623 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8538624 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8538625 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8538626 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8538627 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8538628 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths
8538629 he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8538630 even before we moved the baby and his mother from the clinic the crowd had grown to 150 000 and it is now just as big at the hospital
8538631 people are desperate to have a look at this baby
8538632 we had to call the police to control the situation at the clinic and now the police are on 24 hour guard at the hospital
8538633 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8538634 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8538635 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8538636 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8538637 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8538638 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8538639 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8538640 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
8538641 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8538642 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8538643 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8538644 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8538645 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8538646 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8538647 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8538648 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8538649 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8538650 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle
8538651 my great grandmother worked as a maid in the home of william howard taft
8538652 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8538653 i may make a living by pissing all over the well meaning efforts of amateur actors but at least im not this guy
8538654 he cannot be 100 percent cured but his life quality has improved if once he depended on others to do his activities now he can eat by himself use his hand to write use the cell phone
8538655 we sent him home so he can gather with his family again especially ahead of the fasting month it will mentally help the healing process
8538656 honestly i didnt think i hit it out i just thought it was going in the gap its a big part of the yard i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us that means weve won all three of the road series now we just have to come out tomorrow and try to win
8538657 the one thing he told me early on is that he was kind of looking forward to being in the middle of all this stuff
8538658 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and to have red sox across my jersey and take the mound in a big series and get to pitch is just a blast its like a playoff game its nice when you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game i just love to compete i love to play baseball i love to get out and battle the fact that the games count here is just fantastic for me nothing better than being in a big series
8538659 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankees series for me
8538660 you go out there and every game is crucial all of a sudden you come into this series and i kind of feel like ive been in this scenario for a month from where im coming from
8538661 when i walked into this clubhouse i remember getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away i got a smile on my face its just a good memory and this is the last year of the stadium so you think about things like that once you take the hill im just focused on the hitters and trying to get them out and help this team get to the playoffs
8538662 j d drew losing mike lowell tim wakefield for a little bit josh beckett skipped a start those are huge players on this team i feel like this team has kind of weathered that this team has a lot of character and they play really really hard its a pleasure to be a part of it
8538663 hes kind of the energizer bunny for this team hes the one who stirs stuff up just kind of everything he does he plays good defense hes got some pop hes a huge huge part of this team
8538664 the game was 7 2 and i was just trying to hit a fly ball and get one more run in

8538673 such a set up is a step towards structured total internal reflection fluorescence tirf microscope systems that could be used by non experts
8538674 previous set ups were too complicated to be operated by average microscopy users our method affords flexible and fast adjustment of the illumination parameters which is important for tirf experiments and guarantees ease of use
8538675 our work is a versatile set up that allows one to tune the illumination parameters
8538676 fine tuning of the incident angle allows the penetration depth of the evanescent field and hence the thickness of the optical section to be controlled
8538677 interference is generated in the coverslip which has a higher refractive index than the watery medium enabling the generation of very fine interference patterns fringe periods down to 175 nm using light with a wavelength of 488 nm
8538678 the spectral information that was shifted by the physical convolution upon structured illumination is computationally shifted back to its proper location in fourier space
8538679 finally the reconstructed object spectrum is back transformed in real space giving an image of enhanced resolution

8538763 the first time i took her to a play she was five years old and we had gone to see a high school performance of the wizard of oz
8538764 right in the middle of dead silence after the song somewhere over the rainbow this little voice piped up wasnt that beeeaaaautiful i knew the arts would be in her blood from that moment on
8538765 one day she sat down and said it was something she really wanted to do
8538766 part of me really hoped she would change her mind to me she would always be that little girl that wore ribbons and curls i couldnt imagine her learning how to fire a weapon
8538767 at first i was angry and sad at the same time
8538768 she was my big sister and she wasnt supposed to be in a work field that put her in the line of fire but then one night i had a dream that changed everything it was like she was telling me that it was ok and it felt like a great big hug

8538774 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8538775 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much
8538776 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8538777 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance
8538778 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8538779 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8538780 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain

8538786 im more worried about the season and getting wins for the team
8538787 youve got to let the leash out a little bit
8538788 just so happened once he got to that area holliday came up it wasnt so much the number as much as he just wasnt laboring
8538789 timmys honest there have been a couple games he said his legs were cramping he was adamant that he felt great and the pen has been used quite a bit we had no problem sending him back out
8538790 we want to see him do some catching and playing some first base too
8538791 i feel comfortable at third i played there in 2006
8538792 i cant tell you right now whats going to happen i try to do everything i try to do my best
8538793 he has incredibly soft hands and for a guy his size hes got quick feet
8538794 im not sure if hes ready to play third base on an everyday basis but with his ability if they want to put him there he can handle it i think one day that would not be a bad option if they groom him he could play any of the three positions
8538795 you look good every time you move over a runner
8538796 its nice to have a day off sometimes to think about what theyre doing and relax
8538797 hes been swinging at balls that are more pitchers pitches than his and thats hard to do with a guy like john lackey pitching
8538798 but its normal everyone does this sometimes im learning from it every day
8538799 ill wait a few days and see how it feels
8538800 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8538801 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8538802 that was big for us and anytime we can beat the angels is great
8538803 it was a little hectic it seemed like there were always runners on base
8538804 been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back
8538805 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8538806 this is obviously a temporary setback but fortunately it is not something that is season ending
8538807 on the positive side were dealing with a young kid who should recover nicely im sure monta will work hard during his rehabilitation and well utilize our roster during the first part of the season to try to make up for his loss
8538808 talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8538809 marcus is more of a pass first point guard than ellis if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8538810 you work so hard and you feel like your team is going to be good but you never know until you play
8538811 theres no way to tell but im excited because i see so much talent i see us working together well and i see us making plays
8538812 i think theyre ready to play against someone else theyve worked hard
8538813 i dont know that theyd feel like they theres anything else they can do right now except for playing in a game theyve invested the work so now its time to game plan and execute the game plan
8538814 hes a great athlete with a really strong arm who gets the ball to us really fast hes taken complete control of the huddle
8538815 i think they are confident in us because of our focus on mental assignments
8538816 were physically good enough to play and that all becomes a lot easier and freer when were confident in what were doing
8538817 weve had the luxury of having two great backs for a long time
8538818 there may be a learning curve and those are the growing pains of being young
8538819 but were going to be fine because i know that theyre going to come back with their best efforts
8538820 i think the biggest thing is how are we going to do when its the real deal
8538821 theres only so much simulating you can do anytime there are changes to the scheme or you have a lot of new guys youre not sure how youre going to do until its an actual game day

8538865 children deserve full functioning natural loving dedicated relationships with both of their parents equally in and out of marriage whenever possible
8538866 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8538867 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8538868 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play

8538875 they asked her how she felt playing second fiddle to me which i never felt she was she had the number one song in the country on hot 100 i didnt so she couldnt be playing second fiddle to me when i heard that i was upset like why would she ever go there

8538879 he has incredibly soft hands and for a guy his size hes got quick feet
8538880 im not sure if hes ready to play third base on an everyday basis but with his ability if they want to put him there he can handle it i think one day that would not be a bad option if they groom him he could play any of the three positions

8538883 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008
8538884 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8538885 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers
8538886 when we are being surrounded by bases on all sides and a growing number of states are being drawn into the north atlantic bloc and we are being told dont worry everything is all right naturally we do not like it

8538888 we are prepared to accept any decision including the termination of relations as a whole
8538889 you have no moral right to say it is not proportional
8538890 if we did proportionally in the caucasus what you did in serbia then tbilisi would have been demolished that would have been proportional
8538891 i myself was perplexed when i heard of this appointment
8538892 it turns out that all the words about the cooperation between russia and nato remain words
8538893 im more worried about the season and getting wins for the team

8538933 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8538934 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8538935 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8538936 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8538937 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of
8538938 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8538939 the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8538940 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2

8538993 its been a rollercoaster ride these last two months and we are excited to once again have our doors open for business the community support and concern has been very heartwarming
8538994 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8538995 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings amd results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8538996 studies have also demonstrated that patients with visual impairment tend to have longer hospitalisations make greater use of health and community care services and are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes
8538997 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8538998 weve been waiting for this for over two years it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8538999 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8539000 we believe these kinds of flexible options on the part of industry are part of the answer where nice has said no or where there is an issue about cost effectiveness
8539001 there is a range of different ways of dealing with the problem but there is no silver bullet
8539002 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 pcts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight the resulting stress and suffering has been cruel and unnecessary
8539003 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8539004 an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs

8539034 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8539035 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8539036 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8539037 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother

8539083 some of the names they come up with for these plays we run are just bizarre and bewildering
8539084 they make sense to us once we digest it all but i mean its like aliens talking to each other or something
8539085 if you dont pick things up youre going to be out of a job
8539086 in the spot matt is talking about the west coast offense they run up there and their terminology is much more in depth because they give a name for everything
8539087 they name the formation they name the motion they name the shift they name the play they name the protection we do it a little different down here its a logic based thing to try and keep everything consistent for me im just always trying to name things different things to try and make them fit kind of like a jigsaw puzzle
8539088 things can go wrong in a hurry if you dont call out the play clearly or someone isnt listening and misses even one letter of what you say
8539089 i might call out a play like 525 f post h shoot explode empty right gone
8539090 but if somebody didnt hear the h the entire play is compromised because somebody didnt line up right or went the wrong way that can just kill you because every play is so critical in the play design for it to work communication is paramount from the coaches to the players every single call
8539091 its complicated and theres some long long plays in there but its all preparation and a lot of memorization its like school in a way you do a lot of studying and learning and then you apply it to the game so it becomes natural
8539092 its like dad used to teach me as a kid
8539093 you draw up a play in the dirt and if it doesnt look like its going to work you draw up another one in your head
8539094 when i first broke in i was in the west coast system in green bay and their whole terminology never made sense to me
8539095 i was like what how does this correlate why is it even in here there didnt seem to be any rhyme or reason to it
8539096 in st louis there was more verbiage and i had more to call but i totally understood how they fit it together so it wasnt an issue calling plays because i understood how the concepts would relate
8539097 it basically meant everybody go run a go route the receivers are one on one on the outside and you find the open guy
8539098 its so secretive they didnt want you to lose it or let it somehow fall into the wrong hands not even me and god forbid you lose the game plan on the road during the season youd be in so much trouble

8539100 you have to be serious about this stuff and you have to listen and work as a team and i mean every single day or youre not going to be in this league for very long at all
8539101 look these guys are tested every day and you see it when they line up right or they dont line up right
8539102 if guys continually dont get it they have a real hard time making the team

8539106 we deliver at an economic price where people are happy with it
8539107 it filters out all the old chemicals all the calcium all the nitrates phosphates ammonias
8539108 basically all the junk out of the water thats been put into the water over the previous two to three years
8539109 we can actually irrigate the lawn or flower beds with the waste water
8539110 this is a way that we can remove the minerals remove the problems that we have for the customer without damaging the pool
8539111 the only question weve ever had is how fast can we get it done
8539112 it works they have a technology that can take calcium out we have a product that can take calcium out
8539113 were still conducting our own testing to decide whether or not any of those companies are something we would be interested in recommending to our pool supply stores or something like that
8539114 i follow up on pool forums and online web sites for pools and they said the only way to get rid of those things is to drain it

8539120 i expect the players to win more medals for kenya than the olympics team that arrived on wednesday night
8539121 we did it in athens we are capable of doing it again
8539122 when i saw henry wanyoike training at the olympics village in sydney i told my athletes and other coaches that he was going to take the gold medal in the 10 000 metres
8539123 we cannot stick to 1 300 because these people will be returned and will become jobless
8539124 we have accepted this 600 because if all these 8 000 ugandans working in iraq come back where would we employ them
8539125 we are contracted by a private american firm and its them who are directly contracted by the american government
8539126 this is a free market the guards are free to get in and out if they feel cheated but i can assure you more countries are getting involved in this business
8539127 it is heartbreaking to see an independent government subjecting its citizens to private companies that sell them abroad like slaves
8539128 why are we selling our people to these companies yet we are doing nothing to create jobs at home
8539129 these payments have been going down for some time from 1 300 to 1 000 then to 800 and now 600
8539130 in fact there are other countries willing to send their labourforce to work for as low as 300 this is a general problem because we have many countries involved in this practice and we have no control over what is paid to these people
8539131 i am so proud to win the medal we were within touching distance of the gold but its a huge achievement just getting a medal
8539132 it was an unbelievable achievement and a once in a lifetime opportunity
8539133 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them

8539137 the world cup qualifying match between georgia and the republic of ireland will not take place at the wildparkstadion on september 6th
8539138 this is the result of discussions between karlsruhe sc and the georgian football federation who would gladly have played the match here we would gladly have accommodated them but due to the short notice and organisational issues we unfortunately have asked the gff to look for another venue

8539141 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8539142 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8539143 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing

8539154 congestion might be down but it is wrong to assume that it is simply because there is less traffic when cars on motorways are driven carefully they not only produce less harmful emissions they cause less congestion
8539155 the fact that the most impressive recent drop in congestion has been on a section of the m25 that does not yet have the highly effective variable speed limits that are in place elsewhere on the motorway illustrates the gains to be made by a self imposed careful driving style

8539164 exterminators charging extra for gas to come to your house it has happened to me
8539165 the question that has been raised to us is if this fuel service charge is being added to bills for state services
8539166 there is no such charge in marylands approved intrastate tariff with cavalier we will invite them to come and explain to the commission to which services they are attaching this fuel service
8539167 thats among the things well be looking to clarify when we invite the company in to explain this to us
8539168 the charge is applied on a per account level for accounts that have interstate and or non regulated services

8539170 im not sure how many people go into a dodge showroom and buy a caliber after they ooh and aah over a viper

8539172 there was pent up demand for the new 600 horsepower model
8539173 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8539174 most managers are taking the position that it would be unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8539175 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8539176 while we can and have fixed the problem we cant fix the credibility that was lost by allowing for this process breakdown
8539177 its important to be in the business we are in that were a solid strong investment grade company

8539184 oh and by the way someone died for us on a cross 2 000 years ago isnt it time we did something for him
8539185 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8539186 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8539187 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8539188 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8539189 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8539190 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8539191 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8539192 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8539193 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8539194 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8539195 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8539196 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8539197 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8539198 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8539199 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8539200 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8539201 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8539202 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8539203 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8539204 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8539205 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8539206 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8539207 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8539208 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8539209 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8539210 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8539211 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8539212 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8539213 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8539214 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8539215 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8539216 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8539217 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8539218 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8539219 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8539220 i cant believe i found his email it was as easy as 123
8539221 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8539222 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8539223 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8539224 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8539225 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8539226 if we pursue theological education for its own sake it is bound to go bad on us it will make us proud and conceited the very greatness of the subject matter will intoxicate us and we shall come to think of ourselves as a cut above other christians because of our interest in it and grasp of it
8539227 knowledge puffs up the man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know
8539228 this change had less to do with the rate of technology development and more to do with actual versus anticipated rates of adoption our platform as a service bungee connect has achieved the level of robustness and capability we envisioned and we are committed to its continued regular advancement and support as with most new breakthrough offerings bungee connect will require longer incubation time to become broadly accepted as a start up our action yesterday extends our operating plan well into 2010 to more deeply establish bungee connect in the marketplace
8539229 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8539230 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8539231 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8539232 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8539233 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8539238 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8539239 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8539240 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8539241 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8539242 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8539243 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8539244 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8539245 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8539246 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8539247 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8539248 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8539249 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8539250 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8539251 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8539252 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8539253 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8539254 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8539255 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8539256 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8539257 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8539258 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8539259 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8539260 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8539261 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

8539283 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle
8539284 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8539285 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8539286 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8539287 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him

8539306 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8539307 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8539308 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8539309 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8539310 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8539311 not all of the worlds nations have their own statehood many exist happily within boundaries shared with other nations the russian federation is an example of largely harmonious coexistence by many dozens of nations and nationalities but some nations find it impossible to live under the tutelage of another relations between nations living under one roof need to be handled with the utmost sensitivity
8539312 the artwork is lame and repetitive the jokes are either inside software industry jokes or thinly disguised anti capitalist rantings
8539313 are there really 80 people who find any reference to microsoft in a web comic funny
8539314 why has this been running since 1996 who actually reads it who is the idiot who reads it every day and posts the good ones up on reddit doesnt he realize he is wasting his time
8539315 my god my eyes are bleeding now to think that there are comics out there which are worse than user friendly is every way when user friendly was already pretty bottom of the barrel in all departments

8539321 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8539322 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8539323 the main bratz brand will always remain with mga and we are going full blast forward and nothing will stop us
8539324 the jury made a determination about damages but it didnt make a determination about the connection between the drawings and the damages
8539325 the stakes still remain very very high for mga theyre not out of the woods yet at all
8539326 the real prize is going to be can mattel convince the judge to grant an injunction that would prevent mga from ever producing another bratz product

8539329 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8539330 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8539331 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8539332 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8539333 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8539334 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8539335 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8539336 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8539337 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8539338 you have to make a concerted effort to play schools that challenge you
8539339 weve got nothing to lose well can only get better from facing a quality opponent
8539340 we want to play the best we can and were fortunate enough to get some tough games in our schedule doesnt hurt our in state record any so why not
8539341 but really its hard to get noticed these days you have to do something different
8539342 i didnt make any bones about it when i interviewed for this job
8539343 i told the administration traveling was the way to make this a top ranked national high school program
8539344 but in order to do it there is a price to be paid
8539345 you have to make a concerted effort to play schools that challenge you
8539346 weve got nothing to lose well can only get better from facing a quality opponent
8539347 we want to play the best we can and were fortunate enough to get some tough games in our schedule doesnt hurt our in state record any so why not
8539348 but really its hard to get noticed these days you have to do something different
8539349 i didnt make any bones about it when i interviewed for this job
8539350 i told the administration traveling was the way to make this a top ranked national high school program
8539351 but in order to do it there is a price to be paid
8539352 but i havent given it any thought whatsoever my only goal is to do better than i did last year and only if it helps the team win as far as im concerned winning is my no 1 goal and my only personal goal
8539353 i dont know that you can look that far ahead and i am not too much into records so i dont know
8539354 numerically it probably is within reach but i dont know what is going to happen
8539355 personally i would love to do something like that it would be an honor to get it
8539356 but if i dont get it i am not going to put my head down and walk away and be sad like i said winning is all that matters to me if the yards come along with it then i am grateful for that
8539357 as an offensive line we want everybody to succeed and that includes harvey
8539358 hes a lot more experienced knows the offense a lot better
8539359 his confidence level is higher now that hes playing more compared to last year at this time hes miles ahead
8539360 i trust in the coaches and i trust in our offense
8539361 the load is spread between all of us max hall dennis pitta austin collie andrew george michael reed i wont have more of a burden than anyone else
8539362 we are figuring out ways to get programming to viewers literally on a daily basis
8539363 i have had a number of people tell me theyve called dish and canceled and switched their subscription to directv and the response they got from dish was we just dont see sufficient interest in the programming well there must be some interest or a lot of people wouldnt be switching to directv
8539364 this is a big matchup because whoever wins the ball game sits at the top of the standings for about five weeks and whoever loses sits at the bottom so everybody understands there is a lot at stake
8539365 theres a huge upside if you win and it is not the end of the world if you lose
8539366 the most exciting thing is just to see the whole team perform
8539367 you want to see if everything you worked on since the end of last season is working i want to see what the maturity of this team is how we handle certain situations
8539368 we need to start off on the right foot play a solid four quarters no peaks and valleys
8539369 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8539370 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8539371 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8539372 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8539373 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8539374 they did an amazing job weve got four kids coming back that are going to do some big things
8539375 as good of a setter she is shes a better hitter
8539376 im going to throw my big guns on the outside and see who can stop them
8539377 like it or not there will always be more of everything
8539378 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8539379 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8539380 i understand the responsibility of being west ham manager ive watched games at upton park and other managers here have had similar criticism
8539381 you have to get on with it its part and parcel that fans let you know when they are not happy
8539382 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform
8539383 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8539384 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8539385 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8539386 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8539387 we were playing a very good team with their tails up and they gave us an awful lot of problems
8539388 thank goodness we re found our tempo in the last 20 minutes and got through with two wonderful strikes
8539389 we were not guilty of complacency it was just that our game went to pieces with those two goals leicester scored but we have come out of it with a couple of positives
8539390 when you win at everton and draw at home to pick up four points you dont change your side around a bit
8539391 but there are certainly one or two that have shown that if its not going well on saturday which i hope is not the case then i can put them on and they could change the game
8539392 we started off very slow but it was always a game that could potentially have been a banana skin
8539393 after 20 minutes we looked out of sorts until carlos created a bit of magic and got us back to 1 1
8539394 when that one went in i felt more at ease then the whole lads played well in the second half
8539395 it was a cracking cup tie but our performance was not that great i thought our general play was poor
8539396 im pleased with the result credit to forest for making it very hard for us but credit to us we stuck in there this time last year we were out of the cup
8539397 there were pluses and minuses we can play a lot better but the positive thing is the result we showed good character some of my players left a good impression on me tonight
8539398 there are a few injuries one or two lads went down with cramp steed has a problem david healy got a blow at the end but you expect a physical challenge well assess the situation tomorrow
8539399 djibril cisse had cramp after about 70 minutes ideally we would have not played him for that long
8539400 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8539401 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8539402 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8539403 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8539404 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8539405 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8539406 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8539407 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8539408 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8539409 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8539410 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8539411 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8539412 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8539413 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it
8539414 i would very much urge my side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle to provide an affirmative vote
8539415 obama would not be where he is or even close without that 2004 keynote
8539416 words that shook the world 100 years of unforgettable speeches and events
8539417 if the voter base begins to feel like all hes interested in is the big numbers and isnt interested in the individual especially those independents and crossover republicans
8539418 then of course when we came out and started marching there were all of these people coming from every corner of the country
8539419 will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood
8539420 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8539421 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8539422 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8539423 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8539424 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8539425 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8539426 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back
8539427 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8539428 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8539429 although i know a lot have suffered way more than we have its like having some kind of arriving
8539430 the improvements they did are not worth anything if you dont put in a farmers market
8539431 its just exciting to finally see the fruits of our labor
8539432 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8539433 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8539434 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8539435 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8539436 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8539437 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8539438 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8539439 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8539440 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8539441 post convention florida should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8539442 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8539443 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8539444 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8539445 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8539446 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8539447 members of congress have access to these donors any day of the week
8539448 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8539449 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle
8539450 my great grandmother worked as a maid in the home of william howard taft
8539451 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8539452 das k nnte einen schreck geben da toyota den ausblick f r dieses jahr ja schon vor einem monat gesenkt hatte
8539453 wir haben das ziel unseren derzeitigen marktanteil von ber 10 langfristig mindestens zu halten
8539454 angesichts der herausforderung der unsere branche wegen der extrem gestiegenen treibstoffkosten gegen bersteht sind wir mit dem ergebnis des ersten halbjahres zufrieden vor allem auch deshalb weil sich gezeigt hat dass wir mit unserem auf breiter basis stehenden gesch ftsmodell gut aufgestellt sind
8539455 trotz aller herausforderungen durch die sich abschw chende weltkonjunktur und die explosion des kerosinpreises bleiben wir daher zuversichtlich im laufenden jahr ein positives operatives ergebnis zu erzielen
8539456 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8539457 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8539458 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8539459 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8539460 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8539461 you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8539462 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8539463 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8539464 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8539465 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8539466 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8539467 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8539468 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8539469 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8539470 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8539471 the veto pen on this its entirely up to them
8539472 she did an incredible job i was sitting with all my obama organizer friends and we were all crying this is a turning point she struck a blow for unity
8539473 wow im excited exasperated all sorts of different feelings going on inside me im happy she conceded but it was bittersweet i have more respect for her because she was graceful and came to terms with barack obama as the nominee
8539474 we were not given any instructions by the obama or clinton campaigns on how to vote
8539475 i was selected as a clinton delegate until someone tells me otherwise thats the way im voting
8539476 i am here today to release you as my delegates
8539477 i signed my ballot this morning for sen obama but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice
8539478 what is so important is that at the end of today we will nominate barack obama and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
8539479 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time mr maccallum said to fairfax paper
8539480 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8539481 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8539482 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period mr maccallum said
8539483 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8539484 these reports are absolutely baseless he is definitely not going today
8539485 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread
8539486 i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are
8539487 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8539488 while the pace of monthly falls picked up during the month the less volatile three month on three month measure eased very slightly in august to 4 5 from 4 6 in july
8539489 we expect the next move in the bank rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8539490 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8539491 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8539492 urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8539493 if you look at liverpool sheffield and bristol the levels are low
8539494 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps
8539495 theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp
8539496 however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8539497 it is important that people understand both the dangers of obesity and the benefits to their health of losing weight
8539498 even a modest reduction of 5 10 of body weight leads to reduced blood pressure a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes a fall in obesity related cancer deaths and a reduction in total mortality
8539499 we strongly urge anyone who might be at risk to see their gp who can advise them on weight loss options that are tailored to their needs
8539500 earlier this year we published a 372 million strategy to tackle obesity recognition of the fact that it is the biggest health challenge we face
8539501 over the last 60 years the number of people who are severely overweight has risen steadily and there is a very real danger that todays children will not live longer than their parents
8539502 as part of the strategy this autumn we will be launching a national movement that will bring about a fundamental change in the way we live our lives
8539503 the change4life movement will not hector or point the finger it will give everyone wherever they live the information and support they need to eat more healthily and be more active
8539504 government cannot do this alone that is why we are inviting everyone from multinational food companies to keep fit clubs in village halls to join our movement and make england healthy
8539505 la detrazione d imposta concessa per l abitazione principale trova unica ragion d essere nel fatto che l immobile e oggettivamente destinato e per la parte in cui era pacificamente destinato a tale scopo non ostando all agevolazione il fatto che l immobile sia classificato in una categoria catastale diversa da quelle relative alle abitazioni rilevando la categoria catastale al solo fine di determinare la base imponibile
8539506 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8539507 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8539508 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8539509 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8539510 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8539511 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8539512 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8539513 i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8539514 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8539515 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8539516 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8539517 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8539518 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8539519 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8539520 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8539521 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8539522 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8539523 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8539524 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8539525 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8539526 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the american people and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8539527 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8539528 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8539529 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8539530 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8539531 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8539532 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8539533 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8539534 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8539535 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8539536 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8539537 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8539538 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8539539 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8539540 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8539541 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8539542 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8539543 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle
8539544 my great grandmother worked as a maid in the home of william howard taft
8539545 if everything feels like the movies you bleed just to know youre alive
8539546 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8539547 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8539548 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8539549 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8539550 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days

8539558 wij werden hele goede vrienden zaten eindeloos veel bij elkaar op de kamer met hem had ik mijn eerste speed genomen
8539559 ik verveelde me dood dus ging ik overdag gewoon naar vrienden en ze kwamen bij ons ook veel over de vloer zat ik de hele dag te blowen en speed te gebruiken dat gebruik van speed liep nu bij hun uit de hand en ed ging daarin mee als hij smorgens naar zijn werk ging deed hij de speed in zijn pap
8539560 er kwamen al vrienden over de vloer die smack gebruikten
8539561 dan hoorde ik wel eens n zeggen ik ben ziek heb je niet wat voor me wist ik veel wat dat ziek zijn betekende ik dacht jezus wat een zielepoot nou en zij deden niks iedereen is wel eens ziek
8539562 het rare was toen ik die smack gebruikte was ik maandenlang misselijk en mijn lichaam verzette zich langdurig maar in mijn hoofd was het lekker ze wijst naar haar voorhoofd ed en zij konden ook heftige ruzie krijgen het ging er altijd om wie uiteindelijk de baas zou zijn zon machtsstrijd binnen een relatie bij gebruikers van speed heeft er uiteindelijk toe geleid dat ze toch ook smack gebruikten werden ze weer rustig van achteraf bleek ze raakten vanzelf rijp voor het echte werk

8539578 we know the quality hes got and his physical presence and ability to win headers is something our other strikers dont have

8539584 we have twice offered to attend a meeting with hartlepool united to try to find a constructive way forward that offer stands
8539585 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle united to keep the matter private
8539586 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club there is a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today wednesday when we believed james request was to be discussed
8539587 james has three years left on his contract and i dont even want to talk about losing him hes a very important player for us one who is worthy of a call up to the senior england side
8539588 milner was nearly here two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until it happens

8539599 darlington are the only club he has spoken to and if he agrees to go there it should all be done and dusted in time for him to play for them on saturday
8539600 everybody was excellent you cant go to a place like watford and have people off their game most have to be on their game to get a result against a championship club so were pleased with the performance
8539601 it gives us a lot of food for thought with the players we left out and the fresh ones we brought in
8539602 thats the difference at this level the higher you go up chances like that get taken
8539603 i think they had one chance in the last hour and they took it we had numerous chances and didnt take them
8539604 thats why some of our players are playing at this level and some of theirs are playing at a higher level simple as that
8539605 left foot right foot he can score with both hes good in the air works ever so hard and brings others into play
8539606 if he can get a chance and start training and playing with the best in the country in the premier league it will bring even more out of him
8539607 i would love to see him up against a john terry or a rio ferdinand to see if he could do what he does against the league one defenders

8539671 en toch voelen veel mensen zich bezwaard om kapitaal van persoonlijke relaties te lenen
8539672 logisch want als het fout gaat komen de consequenties erg dichtbij ik raad al mijn cli nten daarom altijd aan om in ieder geval een leenovereenkomst op papier te zetten het risico op scheve gezichten is anders levensgroot al denk je van tevoren vaak dat het wel losloopt

8539675 ik heb me eerst geori nteerd bij de bank maar daar bleek al snel dat een dergelijk risicovol project weinig kans maakte gelukkig kon mijn moeder in totaal een ton vrijmaken daarvoor hebben we een leenovereenkomst met rentepercentage op papier gezet
8539676 mijn moeder staat niet in mijn nek te hijgen als ik een betaling mis en eerlijk gezegd draai ik op het moment pas net quitte dus komt aflossen er voorlopig ook niet van dan is het toch lekker dat je niet wakker hoeft te liggen van boze bankbrieven

8539680 mijn vader en moeder hebben uiteindelijk elk tienduizend gulden geleend voor de fiscus hebben we een tamelijk informele overeenkomst op papier gezet met voorwaarden en een rentepercentage die rente is uiteindelijke nooit betaald want maar aangezien het daarna ontzettend goed ging konden we binnen enkele maanden aflossen en is die rente nooit betaald die hele lening heeft zelfs nooit onze boeken gehaald

8539756 athletically he had quick feet he was strong and he was still growing i followed him when he changed high schools and went and watched him play a game they didnt throw the ball very much as a team at the same time he took over the game i watched it was a close game he scrambled well he executed the offense well he took hits well he directed traffic he did all those intangibles that quarterbacks do
8539757 i dont know if the perception of harvard is justified because the quarterback who was there before i came got drafted in the seventh round like matt flynn
8539758 hes in his fourth year now with cincinnati so theres quality players there like there are here but obviously this is top notch you cant beat the sec
8539759 they dont have any kind of summer program so you show up right at the start of camp and youve got to learn the offense as quick as you can
8539760 its tough for a freshman to come in and really know it all
8539761 that was at the same time we had issues with perrilloux
8539762 we brought him in for a visit and he elected to transfer and come here
8539763 these are the greatest fans in the game as far as their love of the team and knowledge of the game at lsu what else can you ask for its a great place i mean its awesome to get here and get to play quarterback for a team that just won the national championship you kind of sit back and you have to appreciate it its a great honor and i feel very fortunate
8539764 it has been kind of an adventure everywhere ive been
8539765 i cant think of a harder thing for a high school kid to go through
8539766 he knew those guys at brownwood his whole life leaving that town was huge for him then all of a sudden hes here it was a very hostile situation
8539767 he was very calm the whole game thats when i knew he was special
8539768 i think he has the personality to start early in his career
8539769 hes never too high nor is he too low when bottle rockets are firing on the field he doesnt get all hyped and nervous thats just how he is
8539770 i was young then and so i was definitely nervous and scared
8539771 those were my old friends i was playing against as the game got going it worked out then i met new friends it was all good it was a neat experience it helped me grow as a person it really helped me out in life and can see where it could help me here
8539772 if its closer to here people might be leaving this area
8539773 we were expecting it to be a relatively quiet holiday weekend
8539774 how can we connect with our guardian angel the masters and the angelic forces
8539775 there will be some damage but i dont think youll see near the problems that we had
8539776 o home ten un destino que non pode non cumprir
8539777 we offer a unique shopping experience to visitors because they can shop from merchants not only who are local but from around the country
8539778 it really is one of the cornerstones of our organization its our major fundraiser but more importantly every member of junior league participates in it its a commitment that we have made as an organization without that commitment it wouldnt be a success
8539779 its a time where you can really get the first look at all that we have to offer
8539780 they can do some shopping have a relaxing evening not have any hustle and bustle and experience shopping like they never did before
8539781 entirely a web site business there were not many newspapers there
8539782 this is what made this poor palestinian man disabled at birth
8539783 i had one of my aunties and uncles calling me saying like congratulations
8539784 i was kind of down wondering am i really going to be able to make it this year on the team or am i going to have to wait until january to get back in but i had fans and teammates telling me its going to be ok keep your head up and all of a sudden it worked for me fine
8539785 its always been just one child it was always just right there
8539786 it was frustrating when you list in the paper or on the web site that a school doesnt make ayp adequate yearly progress
8539787 it doesnt paint the whole picture of what went on in that building and it doesnt take into account all the successes going on in that building
8539788 a school like brooklyn park needs to continue doing what its doing and get better and better at what its doing
8539789 this new focused pathway allows the school to keep doing business as it has been doing continue to focus so theyre not going to really change their school improvement plan not going to change the governance of the school they can continue to keep working keep developing as a school
8539790 if you walk down the halls the kids feel safe its a beautiful building weve had a great opening this year the teachers are pumped
8539791 the word scramble gave the impression that it was a little too haphazard
8539792 i think the city has made it clear over the last number of years that the no 1 priority is pedestrians no 2 is transit three is cyclists and four is the car
8539793 this is an experiment to see if pedestrians are able to benefit from this and if we are able to get drivers to cope
8539794 he said im sorry we dont take women because they cant handle the work
8539795 it is important to just do the right things and do them well
8539796 always be a lady dont be one of the guys
8539797 i think everybody wants to play everyday if you dont i think theres something wrong with you i dont want to sit on the bench i can cheerlead with the best of them but thats not where i want to be though
8539798 usually i would just pass this off as someone pretending to be curt but the ip address was from boston the e mail address was from 38 studios and well i decided to shoot an e mail over to the address in question and heres what i got back i did not setup a face book account that was me that posted the comment and yes this is curt schilling so there you have it folks curt schilling is not on facebook im about to defriend you mr fake curt schilling not cool buddy
8539799 the boston red sox were down 3 0 to the yankees in the win that series i guess if they can do it we ought to have some faint glimmer of hope for the cavs

8539801 he felt hed have a better chance to play somewhere else probably a good decision
8539802 this team does not know how to practice day in and day out
8539803 i hustled around i had a chance to show my progression for the first time
8539804 alex has done nothing but battle his tail off since hes been here
8539805 its all coming together for him now hes made it into a real competition
8539806 ive been in the program three years im ready to go ive been waiting for this
8539807 since ive been going with the ones the special teams coach has been letting me stay with the linemen and get some work done
8539808 we try to create access and opportunities for every child
8539809 those are the students that pull us down because theyre the last group to decide im going to college students who are really motivated and who are prepared to go to college are the ones who are taking the test early
8539810 if two peoples dna are mixed it doesnt equal someone else
8539811 the only way i ever learned about this was from reading it in the newspaper
8539812 theres a thousand ways it could have happened i could have coughed sneezed or scratched my head
8539813 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8539814 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8539815 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8539816 gifted hands is more than just an inspirational tale of overcoming seemingly impossible odds to succeed

8539829 the proposal is to close five out of the remaining 38 and these have been spread across the three wolverhampton constituencies in my own south east villiers and portobello are marked for closure
8539830 we cant escape the fact that the post office is losing half a million pounds a day and has lost four million customers a week in recent years nine out of ten new retirees have their pension paid into a bank rather than picking it up at the post office
8539831 three out of four post offices across the network actually cost money to keep open the stark fact is that if it wasnt for government subsidy many more would close the network receives a subsidy of 150m a year to keep open thousands of unprofitable branches
8539832 these days the cost of the it equipment and cash deliveries are making it very difficult for the network to make money at all
8539833 and these can be hidden costs sometimes a postmaster will believe he is making a profit but he fails to take into consideration these other costs and he may be actually running his post office at quite a loss
8539834 i understand that no one wants to see their post office closed but we just cant allow this loss to continue over the next few years we are putting in a package of support for the post office network worth up to 1 7bn the proposals announced will mean that over 90 per cent of customers will see no change to the branch they use or will still be within a mile of an alternative branch
8539835 the risk of infection being acquired in healthcare settings is a very important issue and one which is being successfully tackled by the pct

8539839 we made it a goal this summer to take that brotherhood and make it mean something were including everyone from freshmen to seniors were all one team
8539840 we still think it will be a strong year for the defensive line
8539841 theyre just not battle tested on the field yet the defense is a philosophy we always had we want to make sure our defense is really strong
8539842 all seven teams still have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves either back into the race or improve currently in the race
8539843 championships are won on the road but its a lot easier when youre at home
8539844 playing against seattle or san antonio youd want that home court advantage
8539845 a lot of people question whether or not we can even make the playoffs but we still feel very confident
8539846 we still have a lot of talent left on this team and were just going to try to finish up strong
8539847 were counting on you pennsylvania if you dont deliver your votes to barack obama its over before the polls even close in montana
8539848 the fact that the first stop were making is in beaver shows how seriously the obama campaign is taking pennsylvania
8539849 we know this race is going to be close and we know sen mccain will be making an all out effort to win the state
8539850 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8539851 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change barack obama will deliver that change
8539852 im pretty sure it was when my sister was at ursuline academy in wilmington delaware and joe was at archmere academy claymont

8539854 is like 98 percent he brings an open door evaluation of obama to every working family
8539855 i just saw history where hillary clinton released her delegates to obama everyone had tears in their eyes
8539856 basically anyone who was not able to secure a spot in a hotel within downtown denver is forced to take a lengthy trip into the city for events every morning and out of the city from events every evening
8539857 denver is essentially a driving city its sprawling nature is not conducive for an efficient public transportation system
8539858 introducing an environmentally safe cab company would have been both a distinguishing feat for the democratic national convention and a solid investment for the city
8539859 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8539860 i am mindful that only yesterday in birmingham ala our children crying out for brotherhood were answered with fire hoses snarling dogs and even death i am mindful that only yesterday in philadelphia miss young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered
8539861 given the virtual absence of substantive differences between the two democratic rivals its difficult to imagine these core supporters not voting for obama when push comes to shove if it turns out that more than a handful of them dont clinton style feminism will be exposed as an absurdity as opposed to something thats badly out of date
8539862 in preseason they have to get ready and they have to go but you kind of hold your breath the entire time last week there were some very good players who were hurt around the league and you just hold your breath and hope it doesnt happen to your team

8539905 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8539906 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8539907 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8539908 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8539909 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops

8539918 when she came to us initially we thought she was just going to lend us her name

8539928 all that was keeping us in were metal bars which werent even padded
8539929 we had enough in the end and demanded that they stop the jeep and take us back to our hotel
8539930 id never go on one of those safaris again and i certainly wouldnt recommend that anyone else does

8539945 we have been chosen to offer our training facilities to teams taking part in the 2012 olympics so we were naturally delighted to be able to mark the official handover of the olympic games to london
8539946 this was an excellent chance for young people to have a go at sports they may not be able to play at school and a great way to kick off our four years as host of the 2012 olympic games
8539947 our goalkeeper hardly had a save to make and they didnt have many chances
8539948 it was important to keep a clean sheet at some stage and much of the credit has to go to richard stearman and neill collins
8539949 collins especially is much maligned at times but certainly deserves a special mention it was a good team effort but i was especially pleased with the back four
8539950 among other things these properties are in need of adequate insulation and effective double glazed windows now that heating bills are going sky high

8539953 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle
8539954 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8539955 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8539956 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8539957 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him
