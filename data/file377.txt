3770001 current uncertain economic conditions combined with a significant downturn in rv demand
3770002 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3770003 consumer confidence is factor too people have less confidence to make a larger ticket purchase and rvs are discretionary purchases so theyre more difficult to justify
3770004 but its not like the suv market where everyone is running away because of the price of gas
3770005 one of the common ways people finance an rv purchase especially for the bigger vehicles is by taking out a home equity loan and that has of course become more problematic lately because home prices have fallen and people have less home equity
3770006 theres about four five six different variables not just one focus point you have escalating food prices you cant turn on the tv or radio without hearing its another record setting day for fuel and i think thats probably one of the biggest concerns right now not only of rvers but everybody they dont know where this is going to settle in

3770064 the united states and its european allies faced tough choices over how to push back against russia they seemed uncertain how to adjust to a new geopolitical game that threatened to undermine two decades of democratic gains in countries that once were part of the soviet sphere
3770065 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region he said
3770066 what administration in history would not have sent somebody to moscow immediately why are we not in their face
3770067 there is clarity about one thing the south ossetian war has nothing to do with russian support for the rights of ethnic minorities in georgia it has nothing to do either with keeping the peace or the issues of self determination and territorial integrity this is about hubris anger and resentment georgia is paying the price for its pro western foreign policy and its insistence on the right to choose its own friends why for instance has the american reaction been so muted why hasnt george w bush who has done so much to promote georgias cause made a far stronger statement condemning russian aggression and what of the eu is it to be reduced again to paralysis and hand wringing on the sidelines
3770068 as georgian president mikheil saakashvili warned this is no longer about the future of a tiny far away country but about the nature of the world order in the 21st century by its actions russia has stripped away its mask and revealed a bully still aching for the wars of the 20th century if moscow gets away with this it will be encouraged to use its growing muscle and energy clout elsewhere eastern europeans should be watching closely
3770069 many people were also disillusioned by what they considered the feeble reaction of the west particularly the united states georgias main international ally
3770070 weve been hearing all these years that weve got strong and powerful friends across the ocean but it turned out these stories were just a bluff said unemployed valiko 57
3770071 we may be stupid we may have made mistakes but will the u s and europe really let russia get away with attacking another country demanded 26 year old student vakhtang
3770072 for georgia this war has been a disastrous miscalculation south ossetia and abkhazia are now completely lost it is almost impossible to imagine a scenario under which these places home to perhaps 200 000 people would ever consent to coming back into a georgian state they perceive as an aggressor despite welcome efforts to end the fighting the russo georgian war has created yet another generation of young men in the caucasus whose worldviews are defined by violence revenge and nationalist zeal
3770073 over the past few days some western nations have taken positions particularly in the u n security council that have been far from balanced as a result the security council was not able to act effectively from the very start of this conflict by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region
3770074 a kind of a marker of its return to great power status
3770075 i think that the west has gotten the message from russia that you have to pay attention to us were rich again and powerful again because of natural gas and oil
3770076 the second message is being sent to ukraine an area where there are more russian sympathizers they clearly dont want ukraine part of nato this is russian prime minister vladimir putins answer to natos discussion of expanding
3770077 right or wrong has felt humiliated and helpless for 15 to 18 years

3770168 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
3770169 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3770170 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3770171 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3770172 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3770173 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3770174 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3770175 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this
3770176 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on road pretty much but they did hold me for some time i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
3770177 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3770178 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake
3770179 a company will incorporate offshore where there are no taxes
3770180 that parent company charges the u s company lots of money for things like the trademark for the company logo the u s company says i made 50 million but my stupid parent company charged me 50 million for the logo the u s company gets to deduct the royalty fees as an expense and move profits to the parent company offshore in a tax free haven
3770181 even in a good year a lot of firms are failing
3770182 general motors lost 10 billion in 2005 so how much corporate profit tax would you expect them to pay american airlines lost almost a billion dollars what would you want them to pay when theyre already cutting people they pay when theyre profitable
3770183 dont we all fill out our tax returns as aggressively as we know how and take every deduction and credit were entitled to even if theyre unprincipled even if theyre in the tax code only because congress thinks we will appreciate them for subsidizing us
3770184 its common sense corporations dont earn profits in many years
3770185 all that said i think there probably is large tax avoidance by u s multinational corporations but in my view thats driven by the very high u s corporate tax rate a corporate tax rate cut is long overdue
3770186 we have a pretty high nominal corporate tax rate but effectively its not high at all

3770255 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3770256 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3770262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3770263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3770264 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3770265 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3770266 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3770267 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3770268 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3770274 autoritatile de la moscova vor folosi aceasta ocazie pentru a i reaminti ucrainei dezavantajele aderarii sale la nato
3770275 comunicatul de la bucuresti este in continuare valabil aliatii au spus la bucuresti ca intr o zi georgia va deveni membru al nato
3770276 rusia poate sa considere ca este in favoarea ei sa intensifice tensiunile cu ucraina inainte de analiza din decembrie a nato
3770277 daca acest conflict cu rusia incetineste sau chiar impiedica integrarea georgiei in occident o soarta similara ar putea avea si ucraina
3770278 moscova ar putea interveni sa protejeze presupusele interese ale populatiei ruse care s ar simti astfel amenintata
3770279 daca va reactiona prea violent impotriva ucrainei atunci risca sa provoace reactia pe care si o doreste cel mai putin se vor ridica bariere privind comertul si investitiile in fata companiilor sale se va confrunta cu o abordare mai antagonica a tranzitului energiei si mai mult risca sa sperie ucraina si sa o determine sa caute protectia occidentala
3770280 contracareze presiunile pe care rusia le pune asupra statelor vecine mai ales asupra ucrainei cel mai probabil noua tinta a eforturilor moscovei de a crea o noua sfera de hegemonie statele unite si uniunea europeana trebuie sa fie foarte clare n r in dialogul cu rusia pentru ca ucraina si georgia sa nu fie condamnate sa ramana intr o zona gri

3770312 yeah well as you should wait what do you mean kind of

3770319 the extraordinary inflation of liquid asphalt has left us little choice but to suspend future paving projects
3770320 we cannot afford to continue with paving projects that are scheduled for later this year nor would it be a wise use of funds to do so
3770321 we are inviting the whole community to come celebrate the preservation of this working farm
3770322 this is maine farmland trusts first project in the midcoast region and its success is due to the amazing response from the community over 350 families and businesses have contributed so far and we are very close to our 1 1 million campaign goal
3770323 we reached out to the broad community and got such wonderful feedback and enthusiasm for preserving this piece of farmland the positive response is an indication that people are getting more interested not only in preserving farms but supporting agriculture in general
3770324 more and more people are making georgetown a destination with the new restaurants that we have here shops the theater has been a major success for the town in bringing people to the community
3770325 there was nothing we could do the building was engulfed
3770326 it was loud enough i thought our house was falling down
3770327 it the fire was quick it was fast it was quite a devastation
3770328 we had people coming in saying they had their windows shake
3770329 from the restaurant we could see flames shooting out of the building the house in front of the mill looked like it was going to catch on fire
3770330 i couldnt get the lumber and i couldnt get the help
3770331 we used to burn sawdust for years a lot of homes were heated with sawdust from the mill
3770332 i know of farmers who used it for bedding for their livestock
3770333 my husband has a pile of slabs over there right now
3770334 anything i ever did if i needed a two by four for repair work i could always go over there and get it and everyone else here was the same it was nice quick and close and it was good lumber
3770335 they were a respected family his two sons youd never find a better gentlemen
3770336 he had trailers waiting five or six at a time he had a real good business going

3770346 it was one of the greatest nights in the history of rock and roll in cleveland
3770347 we drew postcards from listeners to give away almost 1 200 tickets we knew this was a major event for us our listeners and the other stations simulcasting the concert in an ad hoc network set up with stations in detroit pittsburgh chicago st louis columbus and cincinnati
3770348 the air was literally electric muggy and rainy outside with summer lightning crackling and fans jamming the agora entrance almost two hours before showtime
3770349 they whistled they clapped and chanted in the background as denny sanders signed on the broadcast to welcome the radio listeners
3770350 when i hear of something at city hall i get back to them
3770351 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3770352 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3770353 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term
3770354 canada has a dismal record for organ donation and that has to change
3770355 the bottom line for patients will be increased availability of organs for transplant
3770356 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
3770357 in the same way we delete marriages involving fourteen year olds a man with two wives just cannot exist by law
3770358 they are simply acknowledged it is important for us to check that the documents are authentic and that the husband does not have dutch nationality

3770362 calling for the replacement of race based preferences with class based ones
3770363 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
3770364 we tried to get as many co sponsors as we could and we postured the thing as anti vigilante violence
3770365 we argued that even if you oppose abortion you should not condone these actions
3770366 there were a number of very anti choice senators who voted for face
3770367 indeed if the georgian army had been as aggressive as its public relations campaign then the war for south ossetia might have ended very differently says the times as foreign correspondents poured into tbilisi a team of belgian pr advisers launched a slick operation to keep them updated with e mail alerts detailing the latest alleged aggressions by russia and the georgian governments reaction on sunday for example more than 20 e mails went out to shape georgias message that russia had launched an invasion
3770368 im literally waiting for the first person to talk about how overrated it is
3770369 matt lays a lot of track like he did in season 1
3770370 and the payoffs come fast and furious as they did in season 1
3770371 you get to see what you dont get to see on most tv shows
3770372 you get to see them with these different faces and then finally you get to see them alone loneliness is part of the show because i think its part of the human condition
3770373 its sort of nefarious but its dignified theres no one going on maury povich and saying i slept with my mother and her sister secrets today are given no value because everything is exposed whereas then everything was secret and on three martinis too
3770374 a lot of the information that the audience gets right away no one else has
3770375 that was the suspense is this situation going to explode how could she not know does she know
3770376 to me the mystery and suspense on the show and almost everything on the show comes from the tension between the different people we are the different selves we are
3770377 the monumental nature of these womens challenges the definition of their roles is almost a mental relief for a modern viewer however appalled we might be
3770378 you can turn your radar off for an hour and from a purely entertaining perspective these are some well written dames
3770379 because matt weiner is rather fearless and because of the settings of the 60s we can throw it all around and no one can be like
3770380 he was kicked around for quite some time in his life until he decided to take charge of it himself and rewrite it
3770381 as free as you think you can feel when youve created your identity out of whole cloth it certainly comes with a lot of other unintended consequences that pay off down the road
3770382 something in don from his past is so broken in so many ways that hes got to do a lot of the work to fix that before he can truly move forward and find real happiness that is not ephemeral and meaningless
3770383 its the oldest human experience in the world you get it then you dont want it
3770384 they know my desire is the same as theirs to reach as large an audience as possible
3770385 there are certainly a whole lot of hanging chads from season 1
3770386 dons secretary peggy had a kid junior executive harry cheated on his wife roger was almost dead theres a lot of stuff thats still simmering
3770387 you dont know how he got there you know hes not don draper but you dont necessarily know all the details of how he got to where he is
3770388 i feel like last season was about this group of people and how they related to one another and this year its about that same group of people and how they relate to the world you see a lot of the changes that the world around them is going through
3770389 all great works of art are an epiphany of god
3770390 always be ready to give an explanation to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope
3770391 the earth is waiting for men who will care for it as the work of the creator
3770392 attach conversations to the places you go and the things you see as soon as you open graffitio it looks around you for walls created by other users at restaurants bars stores parks events or anywhere else you could imagine read what other people have to say and leave your own thoughts behind for others to find later you can even create your own walls graffitio connects you to people who have been there before and those who will follow
3770393 graffitio is still pretty raw someone on twitter said that release 3 is a solid 1 0 and i agree with that in its current form its not impressive im really flattered that so many of you are so excited about it and see its potential its really inspiring and why im working my ass off to get new features into your hands
3770394 satanists have always used sex bribery and the depravities and perversions of sex to obtain control of men and women they wished to use to further their diabolical conspiracy satanism makes a god of sex
3770395 a man might think of a wife as a race driver thinks of his car a cowboy his horse a shepherd his dog or a carpenter his tools men treasure the things that belong to them serve them well and are true
3770396 our bigs did a good job of getting out and running kristi harrower did a great job of getting them the ball on the run
3770397 so some of our players lost confidence at the beginning of the game
3770398 ive been speaking to usa head coach anne donovan and she and i agree that russia are one of the form teams
3770399 people can perceive this is a two horse race between the opals and the us but i certainly dont see it that way
3770400 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3770401 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3770402 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3770403 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3770404 we are not used to going to the doctor unless we feel very sick
3770405 as hispanics we dont go to the doctor regularly because most of the time we come here to work and we say we dont have time for the doctor
3770406 which shouldnt be the case we need to take care of ourselves more
3770407 hispanics and health care in the united states access information and knowledge
3770408 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances confronting both hispanic immigrants and hispanics born in the united states
3770409 the data does say there is a decline in this group and this group is largely illegal
3770410 this is about aligning our intellectual capital with the needs of dhs
3770411 theyve given us a challenge to make a different and new approach
3770412 something had to be done to get clients and their lawyers together
3770413 we were able to make a difference in the lives of 40 people so we thought lets go national
3770414 as soon as you are bonded you can start your legal defense

3770445 amgs original archive of thousands of 16mm and 8mm film negatives were stored in the same metal cans that they came back from the lab in they were stored in an attic
3770446 with this improper storage some of the colors on the film would shift dramatically and we do our best to correct it
3770447 whatever emulsion was available in his camera bag that day and some completed and edited films were shot using different emulsions now 40 years later the colors in those segments have shifted in different directions and we find ourselves constantly recutting the digitized footage on mizers old splices to better color correct each frame
3770448 today this sort of thing comes across as hilariously campy
3770449 represents an important era in gay history if it werent for bob mizer and other photographers of his time pornography wouldnt exist as it does today they broke barriers

3770459 most people only booked star wars because they had to
3770460 we didnt give them a choice as illegal as it was thats the way the distribution game was played
3770461 i realized star wars was a hit opening night on a wednesday
3770462 we broke all the house records of the theaters we opened up in george was still working on the movie he was still in the cutting room when i called him and told him he broke all those records he was just finishing up the movie we sent wet prints to the theaters georges reaction was kind of pessimistic like maybe this is just the opening science fiction opens well it has legs for a while then it crashes it never crashed
3770463 a big major release in the mid 70s was 800 prints
3770464 star wars opened on 40 screens because nobody else wanted to book it
3770465 if the film was redone today on the basis of the way movies are released with a couple of thousand prints it probably would have been unsuccessful

3770482 id like to suggest that the fact that obama is a writer not just a typer of e mails and compiler of legal briefs but a writer of literary quality with the ability to craft compelling narrative and interrogate his own feelings on the page tells us some things about him that are worth considering as he competes for the presidency these ideas flow from a few simple observations about writers generally
3770483 writers like words writers like good sentences writers hate clich s writers understand narrative
3770484 although set on the eastern seaboard the story it tells as its narrator himself observes is really about the west but that admission is not the primary reason for scott fitzgeralds novel to be invited into the western hall of fame no it has more to do with the metamorphosis of jimmy gatz into jay gatsby the process begins in childhood evidenced by a ragged old copy of a book called hopalong cassidy into which gatsby to be had inscribed a strict daily timetable and a list of general resolves and concludes when he meets a mentor surnamed cody the name of course is a signal it broadcasts that jay gatsby reborn is a part of that line of self made westerners that begins with the scout whose exploits reenacted thrilled the crowned heads of europe none other than buffalo bill cody on top of all that is the fact that the book concludes with the necessary shoot out

3770520 im very thankful for the opportunity the blue bombers have given me its one of those situations that youre speechless at one point
3770521 when he came in last night we met with him and one of the most impressive things about him was his character hes certainly going to fit in well with this football team seeing him on the field was really exciting seeing what he can bring with his speed and quickness also he has to be somewhat intelligent because we put him through the grinder last night and he was out there actually taking some reps with the offence today
3770522 im very thankful for the opportunity that i have here so i will seize it and move forward
3770523 what happened i like leaving the past where it is for some reason that door closed so you move forward
3770524 the main thing is just getting back out and being able to produce give the same effort but secure the ball thats pretty much where things lie i just want to get out there and play the game the way i do and thats being accountable and playing fast
3770525 its a different situation but its my second time coming into it when i went to hamilton 2007 it was similar situation
3770526 the term is that you just get in where you fit in you just want to do whatever you can to help out just come out and make plays
3770527 it would mean a lot for me to come in and be able to show my teammates just what kind of player theyve obtained
3770528 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light
3770529 the dark energy is simultaneously decreased just in front of the ship to decrease and bring to a stop the expansion rate of the universe in front of the ship
3770530 if the dark energy can be made negative directly in front of the ship then space in front of the ship would locally contract
3770531 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
3770532 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
3770533 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
3770534 by a very long margin this is the most positive response ive ever seen to any story ive worked on
3770535 a broad network of characters into a few representative types
3770536 because when richard finds out the bank lied about his monthly income it sums up how the loans were just a scam
3770537 because it used small words because it still used big words for those of us who could grasp them
3770538 why it seemed like a good idea at the time what were they
3770539 i could actually explain the mortgage debacle to someone else
3770540 it also made me really angry their incredulity was contagious
3770541 you can almost lust with the characters after the money that the idiots have left available
3770542 and they dont do a very good job of talking about the beginning and what got us to this point where it became news
3770543 i didnt really understand this it was in the news all the time but i didnt know what they were talking about until i heard that episode
3770544 its not only necessary background for the future readers of news but also the future writers
3770545 the idea was to take something our readers would be hearing about on a national level monday and give it a local spin our business reporter was tied up finishing a sunday package or he would have done it himself
3770546 i was able to ask intelligent questions of the bankers and real estate agents
3770547 rather than say just how do these changes to the mortgage practices impact us locally and hope they give me an honest answer i understand
3770548 helped me save face ask the right questions and understand what the bankers were telling me
3770549 news consumers in the us get lots of facts quickly updated and delivered through a variety of media but they get very little backstory to help contextualize the facts delivered and rarely get follow up stories or speculations about the future
3770550 here is one advantage bloggers have in the struggle for reputation for the users trust they are closer to the transaction where trust gets built up on the web theres a big difference between tapping a built up asset like the st pete times brand and creating it from scratch
3770551 you dont own the eyeballs you dont own the press which is now divided into pro and amateur zones you dont control production on the new platform which isnt one way theres a new balance of power between you and us
3770552 howard weaver vice president for news at the mcclatchy company said it comes as close as anything ive seen to a roadmap for the near future
3770553 just so you know the media has no mind it cannot make decisions which means it does not get behind candidates it does not decide to oppose your guy or gal it is a beast without a brain most of the time it doesnt know what its doing
3770554 im just advising newsroom joe and jill make room for fdl in your own ideas about whats coming on news wise dont let your own formula blog opinion fake you out a conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think
3770555 were at the twilight of the curmudgeon class in newsrooms and j schools though they can still do a lot of damage you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
3770556 the important thing is to show integrity not to be a neuter politically and having good facts that hold up is a bigger advantage than claiming to reflect all sides equally well
3770557 enterprise reporting goes pro am assignments are open sourced they begin online reporters working with smart users and blogging editors get the story the pack wouldnt couldnt or didnt
3770558 newassignment net just launched its first reporting project a partnership with wired com and newsvine its called assignment zero heres the deal and the links
3770559 a highly satisfying failure jeff howe called it in wired no a spectacularly successful failure says beth lawton at the digital edge meanwhile offthebus net launched this week carrying the lessons of zero into political space
3770560 here are my coordinates for the territory we need to be searching i got them from doing a distributed trend story with wired com and thinking through the results
3770561 this white house doesnt settle for managing the news what used to be called feeding the beast because there is a larger aim to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch to make it less important in running the white house and governing the country
3770562 youre assuming that you represent the public i dont accept that
3770563 bush and his advisors have their own press think which they are trying out as policy reporters do not represent the interests of a broader public they arent a pipeline to the people because people see through the game of gotcha the press has forfeited if it ever had its quasi official role in the checks and balances of government
3770564 savviness that quality of being shrewd practical well informed perceptive ironic with it and unsentimental in all things political is in a sense their professional religion they make a cult of it and it was this cult that karl rove understood and exploited for political gain
3770565 were headed i think for schism tumult and divide as the religion of the american press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists the net is opening things up shifting the power to publish around consumers are becoming producers readers can be writers
3770566 some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up then in the demand for
3770567 theyre not equals but washington and arlington have their own spheres over the newspaper and reporting beats len downie is king over the website jim brady is sovereign over the user s experience no one has total control theres tension because theres supposed to be tension
3770568 an industry that wont move until it is certain of days as good as its golden past is effectively dead from a strategic point of view besides there is an alternative if you dont have the faith or will or courage needed to accept reality and deal the alternative is to drive the property to a profitable demise
3770569 so while people in the old press pack up and tell stories about giants they knew in the era when they are also asking each other where headed
3770570 mcclellan bush cheney and rove proved there were other ways
3770571 woodward and bernstein of 1972 74 didnt have such access and this probably influenced for the better their view of what nixon and his men were capable of watergate wasnt broken by reporters who had entree to the inner corridors of power it was two guys on the metro desk
3770572 just one mans opinion but now is a good time to say it the new york times is not any longer in my mind the greatest newspaper in the land nor is it the base line for the public narrative that it once was some time in the last year or so i moved the washington post into that position
3770573 this here is a post for practically everyone in the game of seizing on media bias and denouncing it which is part of our popular culture and of course a loud part of our politics and this is especially for the were fair and balanced youre not crowd wherever i may have located you
3770574 the posts links dont expire you see links to the new york times do
3770575 oreilly feeds off his own resentments the establishment sneering at inside edition and like howard beale the mad prophet of the airwaves his resentments are enlarged by the medium into public grievances among a mass of americans unfairly denied voice
3770576 dan rather and cbs took the risky course impunging the motives of critics rather than a more confident and honorable one lets look at our sources and methods what can explain such a blind reaction here is my attempt
3770577 occupy the reasonable middle between two markers for vocal critic and critics look ridiculous charging you with bias their symmetrical existence feels like proof of an underlying hysteria their mutually incompatible charges seem to cancel each other out the minute evidence they marshall even shows a touch of fanaticism
3770578 among foreign correspondents there is a phrase parachuting in thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency without much preparation staying only as long as the story remains big the high profile people who might parachute in are called bigfoots in the jargon of network news the problem with being a bigfoot of course is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes
3770579 the bias charges are getting more serious lately as the stakes rise in iraq and the election but there is something lacking in press coverage and it may be time for wise journalists to assess it the re building story has gone missing and without it how can we judge the job bush is doing
3770580 there are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties i think there is an abyss to observation alone and i feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists they dont trust that abyss
3770581 find some new information and put it into your post
3770582 opinion based on information everyone has is less valuable than opinion journalism based on information that you dug up originated or pieced together so its not important to us that contributors keep opinion
3770583 what capacity for product development do news organizations show zip how are they on nurturing innovation terrible is there an entreprenurial spirit in newsrooms no do smart young people ever come in and overturn everything never
3770584 number one is the houston chronicle number two the washington post theres more and theres a big chart so check it out more
3770585 i think the happiest conference goers at blogher were probably the newbies people who want to start blogging or just did they got a lot of good information and advice some of the best information was actually dispensed in response to the fears provoked by blogging which shouldn t be avoided the sages said but examined turned around defused and creatively shrunk
3770586 the weblog comes out of the gift economy whereas most of today s journalism comes out of the market economy
3770587 the quality of any weblog in journalism depends greatly on its fidelity to age old newsroom commandments like check facts check links spell things correctly be accurate be timely quote fairly
3770588 sure weblogs are good for making statements big and small but they also force re statement yes theyre opinion forming but they are equally good at unforming opinion breaking it down stretching it out
3770589 when youre sitting at your desk and there are things strange wonderful and new on your screen you may have to re decide what journalism is and is finally about in order to cover the new class of cases that arise when youre doing it live online
3770590 its pirate radio legalized its public access coming closer to life inside the borders of blogistan a real place with all the problems of a real place were closer to a vision of producer democracy than we are to any of the consumerist views that long ago took hold in the mass media including much of the journalism presented on that platform
3770591 and big media doesnt entirely own the press because if it did then the first amendment which mentions the press would belong to big media and it doesnt these things were always true the weblog doesnt change them it just opens up an outlet to the sea which in turn extends the press to the desk in the bedroom of the suburban mom where she blogs at night
3770592 journalists think good information leads to opinion and argument its a logical sequence bloggers think that good argument and strong opinion cause people to seek information an equally logical sequence what do the bloggers bring to this my short answer to the press is everything you have removed
3770593 journalists you can stop worrying about bloggers replacing the traditional news media were grist for their mill says satullo a mill that doesnt run without us bloggers consume and extend the shelf life of our reporting and they scrutinize it at a new level of intensity
3770594 the web is good for many opposite things for quick hitting information for clicking across a field for talk and interaction its also a depth finder a memory device a library an editor not to use a weblog for extended analysis because most users wont pick that option is web dumb but media smart whats strange is that i try to write short snappy things but they turn into long ones
3770595 i remember the moment when presidential campaigns turned from just maddening and absurd to completely empty for me it might have happened years before but i am a believer in politics so it took until the fall of 2000 bush and gore were then fighting it out not by opposing one another in any kind of argument but by running virtually the same campaign on the same issues pandering to the same groups advancing a rhetoric that sounded the same but for a few catch phrases
3770596 somehow it had all gotten away from them presidential campaigns had drifted out of alignment with most americans the ritual no longer seemed like something the country did for itself every four years but what a professional cadre did and sold back to the country as politics but it wasn t really at least it wasn t democratic politics at anything like capacity
3770597 were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do not because there would be no news but rather no common repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story a turning point a surprise a trend master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend for how do you keep the story running while a switch is made
3770598 spin alley an invention of the american press and politicos shows that the system we have is in certain ways a partnership between the press and insiders in politics they come together to mount the ritual an intelligent nation is entitled to ask if the partners are engaged in public service when they bring to life their invention alternative thesis they are in a pact of mutual convenience that serves no intelligible public good
3770599 how is it you know youre the press because you have a pass that says press and people open the gate the locker room doors admit you
3770600 the answer i think involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years but it is never dealt with probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands the secret is this pssst the press is a player in the campaign and even though it knows this as everyone knows it the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for
3770601 i think its a bankrupt form it serves no clear purpose has no sensible rationale the journalists who offer us strategy news do not know what public service they are providing why they are providing it for whom it is intended or how we are supposed to use this strange variety of news
3770602 when journalists avoid drawing open conclusions they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias of having a concealed agenda of not being up front about their perspective of unfairly building a case for against while pretending only to report what happened
3770603 no one knows what a political convention actually is anymore or why it takes 15 000 people to report on it two successive regimes for making sense of the event have collapsed a third has not emerged thats a good starting point for the webloggers credentialed in boston no investment in the old regime and its ironizing
3770604 nobody had ever asked to anchor convention coverage from the floor feist said as we shared a booth like real diners cnn got the new gear tested it out and made the request to the democrats the democrats said yes and right there the sky box era at conventions came to an end
3770605 journalists find before them with 50 days left a campaign overtaken by vietnam by character issues attacks and fights about the basic legitimacy of various actors including the press itself including dan rather its been a dark week and the big arrow is pointing backwards
3770606 the every four years headset is like outdated software still running because its an expensive decision and major disruption to replace a piece of press think so big with so many parts there is no agreement on a new think system and there is every incentive to keep the old program going for another election cycle even though the world has moved on

3770635 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
3770636 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
3770637 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate

3770639 this has been my life and passion for the past 23 plus years and i am very sad to see it come to this but i cant survive the continuing corporate invasion of annapolis and the sinking economy
3770640 personal predilection it goes without saying is not adequate for recourse to provisions of law in exempting information from disclosure
3770641 it is felt that specific information regarding the terms and conditions of the deposits may amount to disclosure of information including commercial confidence trade secrets or intellectual property which would harm the competitive position of third parties
3770642 rescue efforts were hampered by narrow lanes leading to the site as well as rains
3770643 the notice had been issued last year and the tenants had been asked to evict their homes the tenants were not co operating in conducting the repairs suggested and negotiations were on

3770656 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3770657 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3770658 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3770659 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3770660 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3770661 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that forces may be behind these events
3770662 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3770663 at the bottom of the bill woahhhh so could i stroll right into a bank and demand my money in silver do you think anyone has ever tried that these days haha wikipedia

3770707 if you could get near him you could very easily pull off the arm of the t rex he would die because he would bleed to death
3770708 scientists have theorized that t rex could probably breathe fire
3770709 facts are meaningless you could use facts to prove anything thats even remotely true
3770710 eight hours is not going to do it for them nine ten eleven depending on their age
3770711 i would say no later than one week prior to school you want to get them back into that regular schedule
3770712 i would probably allow them no less than two to three days for each hour youre trying to shift them
3770713 i may believe x but heres y you cant refute y
3770714 why are you wasting my time with arguments against y i believe in x
3770715 i may believe x but heres z you cant refute z
3770716 they believe things are real only if they can measure or weigh them
3770717 like pat there he believes if you cannot weigh or measure it etc that it cannot be real
3770718 alas no great literature is emerging from this degenerate belief any more unless you count the left behind books
3770719 really exists and is eternal even if nobody talks about it much any more
3770720 we dont need to displace religious feelings onto anything because we dont have them and the sooner the rest of your clowns get over this cultural inertia thats bogging you down in unnecessary piety we can move on to much more interesting subjects
3770721 they say why as a christian dont you condemn the life of brian i said i love the film and i think it is good for religion to be knocked to be criticised to be challenged because we have done a lot of damage in the past
3770722 we know religion is a force for good but i dont want to control a writer not to criticise me because i may need that criticism
3770723 whats an ex theologian going to do for a living
3770724 truth is more important than somebody elses supernatural security blanket especially in an age when people are still killing each other over whose blankie is better anyway security blankets and imaginary friends are for children its about time for humanity to grow up a little
3770725 alas no great literature is emerging from this degenerate belief any more
3770726 now i am concerned about some of those in the religion profession who want to take their religion into the political sphere or want to impose their views on others i think some of these leaders are quite dangerous unfortunately atheists actually play into these guys hands by giving them someone to attack
3770727 unfortunately atheists actually play into these guys hands by giving them someone to attack
3770728 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
3770729 dawkins pretty much said as much in his book so im still with him
3770730 the best religious thought comes from jesus and jesus was pretty much embracing liberal hippie ideals with some screwed up stoner hallucinations thrown in
3770731 concludes on the basis of moral arguments that the probability that god exists in 67 but this isnt enough for unwin so he goes on and suggests that by the virtue of faith the probability raises to 95
3770732 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
3770733 i am familiar with plantinga and his arguments are utter nonsense his evolutionary argument seems to rely on a bogus probability defense a poor understanding of evolution and a strangely charitable assumption of the reliability of the human mind its also a fundamentally negative argument he claims that evolution has a low probability of generating a mind therefore god its not at all persuasive
3770734 jim lazarus being a philosopher like wilkins the subject of the thread i have run into those arguments
3770735 the swedish photo magazine kamera amp bild today recieved an official invitation to canons launch of new eos cameras the date is as early as august 26
3770736 is the 5d replacement collecting in the warehouses we had this comment thanks from a visitor to a jessops store in the uk
3770737 the canon rep has told them the 5d replacement has started shipping and is in the uk already insufficient quantities to release as yet though unfortunately they werent able to give me any specs or details as the canon guy didnt know anything
3770738 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3770739 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3770740 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason
3770741 well start with the trivial and move on to the egregious
3770742 1 in 5 people reporting an experience is a large enough number to say that people who have near death incidents remember some sort of experience but its not good evidence for the idea that the experience was what everyone goes through when they die because the vast majority of people didnt experience anything
3770743 almost everyone has heard of a boy drowning in cold water then after half an hour of submersion being resuscitated with no ill effects and no brain damage
3770744 if consciousness is created by brain chemistry there is little likelihood of a conscious afterlife however many intriguing experiments now exist to show that a persons thoughts can move beyond the brain besides the various experiments in telepathy and remote viewing which are much more credible than skeptics will admit there is a replicated study from the engineering department at princeton in which ordinary people could will a computer to generate a certain pattern of numbers they did this through thought alone having no contact with the machine itself yes hes citing pear as evidence you know pear the idiots whose work i thoroughly mocked on several occasions for being sloppy dreadful crap based on deliberately invalid mathematical analysis the guys who admit in their own papers that their measurements are not statistically significant who do things like pick a supposed time stamp and then go back and retrospectively select samples that match their predetermined conclusions yes thats what he considers a good study and he even claims that its been replicated which not even the pear folks are bold enough to claim
3770745 then it may be that what we call the soul
3770746 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions
3770747 the whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner but that they reflect a certain underlying order which may or may not be divinely inspired
3770748 all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind this mind is the matrix of all matter
3770749 i want to know how god created this world i am not interested in this or that phenomenon in the spectrum of this or that element i want to know his thoughts the rest are details
3770750 cant and doesnt are two highly divergent concepts chopra is writing for a popular audience and is not about to inject a mathamatical proof into the proceedings it is an admittedly unproven theory on his part and he says as much
3770751 a man does not attain the status of galileo merely because he is persecuted he must also be right
3770752 then it may be that what we call the soul
3770753 incidentally none of your quotes have anything to do with the existence of an afterlife
3770754 the topics discussed in what the bleep do we know include neurology quantum physics psychology epistemology ontology metaphysics magical thinking and spirituality the film features interviews with individuals presented as experts in science and spirituality interspersed with the story of a deaf photographer as she struggles with her situation computer animated graphics feature heavily in the film the film has received widespread criticism from the scientific community physicists in particular claim that the film grossly misrepresents the meaning of various principles of quantum mechanics and is in fact pseudoscience
3770755 i want to know how god created this world i am not interested in this or that phenomenon in the spectrum of this or that element i want to know his thoughts the rest are details
3770756 electrical activity does not terminate in a living brain the admittedly interesting cases of people whose hearts have stopped for extended periods of time in extremely cold conditions is irrelevant to the fundamental question was there electrical activity in their brain and the answer is yes
3770757 note that brain electrical activity can stop completely or apparently completely a
3770758 brain death is defined as a complete and irreversible cessation of brain activity
3770759 i just find it irritating when sincere intelligent individuals striving for something nobler than eating and shitting are made targets by the emotionally and intellectually challenged
3770760 i believe in debates in philosophy you should always replace what you displace
3770761 chopra invokes the math of information theory to give his nonsense a gloss of credibility my entire point such as it is is that doing that is stupid
3770762 existence of afterlife effective chemotherapy treatments i dont think so your reasoning is this both are promoted by stupid people therefore these two subjects are equivalent
3770763 making money by misusing science to support a view about the afterlife
3770764 making money by misusing science to sell an ineffective treatment for chemotherapy side effects
3770765 an earnest desire to know the truth about life after death
3770766 when electrical activity in the brain stops is when they stop trying to bring you back
3770767 although i am skeptical by profession i think cases like this are extremely compelling
3770768 of course my brain is my most important organ but then i ask myself who told me to say that
3770769 the problem is with using science as metaphor and then confusing the metaphor with an assertion as to fact
3770770 in the area of information theory a rising body of evidence suggests that nature preserves data in the form of information fields the most basic units of creation such as quarks and gravity may be interrelated through information that cannot be created or destroyed only recombined into new patterns if this is true then it may be that what we call the soul is a complex package of information that survives death as well as precedes birth
3770771 the roadmap calls for uniting the movements which did not sign the abuja agreement for darfur peace entering into direct negotiations for achieving a fair and comprehensive peace in the province that does not exclude any party and holding internal trials under international supervision of those who prove to have committed war crimes in darfur
3770772 peaceful and just solution of the darfur issue is part of the solution for the crisis with the icc in the hague

3770780 michaels mind is like a clock he can go into the 200 butterfly knowing he needs to do the first 50 in 24 6 to break the record and can put that time in his head and make his body do 24 6 exactly
3770781 in high school theyd send tapes from his international races hed say mom i want to have dinner in front of the tv and watch tapes wed sit and hed critique his races hed study the turns see thats where i lifted my head i couldnt even see what he was talking about over and over

3770788 the american public is more deeply concerned about the economy than they were about the war at its height opinion wise

3770799 el enemigo dentro de esa supuesta concepci n nacionalista que pueda anidar en algunas bases de una organizaci n terrorista o de un fen meno social que justifica la pr ctica de la violencia de eta es el pnv
3770800 ese movimiento va evolucionando a un fen meno de radicalizaci n incluso con una diferencialidad con respecto a afinidades supuestamente ideol gicas que pudieran haber existido en generaciones anteriores
3770801 lo que me preocupa realmente de ese mundo de cara a una posible resocializaci n e reinserci n en la sociedad es que est alimentado en el odio
3770802 a josu erkoreka no le neg que ese acuerdo con pp rechazara un final dialogado de la violencia
3770803 haber una garant a para que nadie pueda valerse en la ambig edad de que no ha habido un pronunciamiento sobre el final definitivo de la violencia y ma ana sale una escisi n pasado ma ana no s qu organizaci n
3770804 tiene que haber un pronunciamiento de final definitivo de la violencia por parte de eta y dentro de ese fen meno adyacente al terrorismo tiene que haber un final dialogado que no tiene que contemplar objetivos pol ticos
3770805 alguna informaci n podemos tener tambi n el pnv de que hay un malestar dentro de ese mundo en el que se llega a la reflexi n de si hay presos de primera y de presos de segunda en la medida en que hay una directriz de no abonar fianzas para salir en libertad condicional y sin embago hay quien sale en libertad condicional mediante el pago de fianza sobre si retomando experiencias anteriores hay una contestaci n tambi n a la v a de la pr ctica de la violencia

3770827 you happen to be in a pretty down economy at this point
3770828 anyone that is talking about new taxes is clueless in the commonwealth you just dont raise prices or taxes in a down economy
3770829 over the next ten years we are going to need some additional revenue
3770830 just like in previous administrations they get in and they have these grandiose ideas
3770831 sometimes the economy is good and you go for them but sometimes you just have to wait for a while to do them

3770836 these guitars are totally unique and that is hard to do in todays guitar market we look forward to bringing great success to ministar
3770837 in our extensive research and testing we found that it isnt the amount of wood on a guitar that determines the quality of the tone and sustain
3770838 we construct ministar guitars from a single piece of hard rock maple ensuring that the maple wood grain runs the full length of the guitar from the bridge all the way to the end of the headstock
3770839 the consistent uninterrupted wood grain running throughout the guitar is the key to ministars fantastic tone and sustain
3770840 other guitars lose tone and sustain by gluing together disparate pieces of wood as they attach the headstock to the neck to the body
3770841 or really any kind of action desired by the guitarist low medium or high
3770842 and the level will touch every fret perfectly across the neck

3770879 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
3770880 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

3770906 this is a salute to the great artistes contribution to indian cinema we already had an encouraging response during our previous film festivals we are planning the next annual film festival in feb 2009
3770907 dev anand has sent his best wishes for the festival he cant come for the event as he is busy with his forthcoming movie chargesheet in mumbai
3770908 dev anand was amazed to see his fan following in this city when he came here last time the movies that we are showing in the festival are the favourites of dev anand and have been selected by him only
3770909 we are conducting this festival on a no profit basis and are giving complimentary passes to all the interested moviegoers we are also planning to offer free cold drinks and snacks to the audience

3770915 it doesnt make sense in some neighborhoods to keep paying costs and costs
3770916 it can make more financial sense to give it away
3770917 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3770918 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars
3770919 if you look at how the routing is done on the internet there are a few major networks that are providing interconnectivity to everyone else
3770920 i dont see a cybertruce but im not seeing devastating effects as well
3770921 its obvious they are suffering from serious attacks but saying this is an internet war is blowing it out of any possible proportion before we have more information
3770922 you can bet that these attacks have cost georgias private sector far more than the perhaps 2 000 it cost the perpetrators to do them
3770923 and in the long run that loss of national productivity affects not only georgias financial ability to wage war but its peoples willingness to engage in it

3770935 after tuesday i have a higher level of conviction that theyre on hold for the rest of the year
3770936 his dissent is meaningless if this is where he thinks growth is
3770937 to take grip and become part of the psyche of the way decisions are made in our economy
3770938 even if we get through this energy price bulge and inflation moderates im still concerned of the overall pattern weve set
3770939 for us to lose substantial ground on inflation would be much more costly for us to remedy than for us to have to face a more substantial slowdown in growth than weve seen so far
3770940 especially with the developments weve seen on the energy side where at least from my perception some of the concerns about inflation and inflation expectations seem to have diminished

3770947 de werkdruk bij arbeiders uit zich vooral in fysieke problemen rugproblemen bijvoorbeeld komen heel vaak voor bij bedienden is er sprake van psychische problemen vaak hoor je de klacht bij bedienden dat ze na vijf jaar opgebrand zijn gisteren had ik nog iemand aan de lijn die zich erover beklaagde dat hij na drie dagen verlof nog steeds oververmoeid was
3770948 er stelt zich bij flightcare vooreerst een probleem van uurroosters die zijn door de nachtelijke periodes dat er gewerkt moet worden heel zwaar en worden bovendien om de haverklap gewijzigd wij eisen dat de voorziene uurroosters gerespecteerd worden daarnaast moeten de voorziene middagpauzes gerespecteerd worden en moeten er recuperatiedagen voorzien worden voor werk op feestdagen voorts dient de wetgeving op overuren gerespecteerd te worden de sociale wetgeving heeft over deze punten reeds proces verbaal opgemaakt
3770949 de lonen op de luchthaven zijn in het algemeen te laag en er stelt zich ook een probleem op vlak van classificatie bepaalde jobs zijn met name te laag ingeschaald er moet ook een kilometervergoeding voorzien worden bedienden moeten geregeld voor slechts 4 uur komen werken een ander probleem is dat er geen vergoeding voorzien is voor zaterdagwerk
3770950 als aan die eisen niet voldaan wordt kunnen de oekra ense autoriteiten de oorlogsschepen de bevoorradingsschepen en de luchtvaartuigen van de russische vloot in de zwarte zee vragen het oekra ense grondgebied onmiddellijk te verlaten

3770965 that news conference was just drumming up support for john block
3770966 in our opinion a grouping of the anc cannot go to an office of the anc and convene a press conference
3770967 such blatant undermining is highly irresponsible and reinforces and advances a factionalist agenda
3770968 our viewpoint is simply we are the same leadership collective under the leadership of john block which consolidated around the polokwane product and the leadership of jacob zuma
3770969 the rare privilege to assist to build hegemony between the anc and government
3770970 the premier rather defied the leadership and its mandates time and time again
3770971 we hold dear the firm view that robert mugabe and mswati iii are not legitimate leaders of their various countries they cannot claim any amount of legitimacy to rule their countries for they have not been democratically elected by the people of their countries
3770972 the anc has invented an unprecedented appointing body which both appoints and removes members of the sabc board on the advice of the national assembly it consists of the president acting in consultation with the speaker of the national assembly
3770973 this is surely antithetical to the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers
3770974 the president leads the executive authority of the state while the speaker is the executive officer only for parliament as an institution not the republic
3770975 he can hardly be asked to perform the purely executive aspects of this function in consultation with another arm of state
3770976 i also find problematic the absence of any explicit requirement for due enquiry before the national assembly adopts a resolution to remove a member or to dissolve the entire board
3770977 implicit administrative justice is not enough administrative justice when it is abundantly clear that a purge is being proposed for political reasons
3770978 the proposition that the entire board may need to be removed is offensive and will be seen for what it is an attempt to get rid of persons duly appointed prior to the installation of a board complaint with the new anc rulers
3770979 a transparent step of the anc to obtain permanent political control over the sabc board and thus control over the public broadcaster
3770980 this is a far reaching infringement on the sabcs independence as public broadcaster
3770981 amendments to the law to get rid of individual members of the sabc board who are guilty of corruption or similar serious cases which the ff plus supports is something totally different to this new amendment
3770982 the reason for the amendment of the broadcasting act is directly linked to the power struggle and change of leadership in the anc
3770983 it is not and its hurting this city and you need to stop it
3770984 we live at a time when the governed are governed on the basis of continued service delivery where leaders retain the loyalty and respect of their constituencies because they are vehicles for development
3770985 traditional leadership has become much more than just heredity it has become as much a service as being served and also about making a difference in the lives they lead
3770986 we hope our traditional leaders shall latch on to this opportunity and also take full advantage of this training and equip themselves with the skills on offer so that their leadership abilities may be enhanced even further
3770987 we would like to unleash the power of traditional leaders to empower themselves as well as those people they serve and we also want to make them feel both fulfilled as individuals and confident as leaders of their communities
3770988 with traditional governance brought in line with current corporate governance principles and practices it cannot be denied that relevant tools such as ict will be required to effect the latest approaches and that facilities such as proper offices and boardrooms would be justifiable
3770989 it is against the background of all the benefits i have catalogued that we welcome this training programme with open arms
3770990 we are among the first provinces in the country to develop and enact legislation to institutionalise cooperative governance between government and dikgosi chiefs so that the two institutions could jointly better the lives of our people

3771247 we have been running our beach safe campaign with the lowestoft journal in a bid to remind residents and visitors to be aware of the potential risks and to consider their actions
3771248 it is important that you do not swim or play near groynes and piers if you see the red and yellow flag flying on the beach it means that lifeguards are on duty suffolk homes
3771249 efallai nad yw tynnu dwr yn niwsans fel y cyfryw ond fe all fod os yw hyn yn digwydd yn aml ac yn ystod oriau angymdeithasol
3771250 of course theres no doing it justice here remind me to take you to a performance
3771251 wed like a basket of turkish bread and olive dip in balsamic vinegar please and some of the yoghurt dip as well is that all right romana
3771252 well isnt this nice much better than hanging around in the tardis for a week
3771253 i still think wed get more work done repairing the chameleon circuit if we went to logopolis instead of trying to patch it up on earth wed get more work done if we just stayed in the tardis
3771254 so a lot of people have commented it could be that the universe is full of danger i suppose though i rather fancy that we just lead interesting lives
3771255 interesting is certainly one way to put it ive seen more cells dungeons and prisons since i started travelling with you than i care to remember well actually its thirty eight exactly not counting the simply marvellous happy fun forced resting place of the digee planet
3771256 being dropped into a deep bottomless pit of brightly coloured plastic balls isnt exactly my definition of fun
3771257 well what about all the amazing wonders of the known universe
3771258 im not being critical doctor not really travelling with you is always interesting i can say that i just wondered thats all
3771259 dont you think that the probability of the tardis materialising exactly where were needed most is beyond coincidence
3771260 oh romana people everywhere need help theres always something going on that needs a bit of tweaking a slight nudge in the right direction
3771261 even so its amazingly fortuitous that were exactly where we can help at the crucial moment at the crucial place its like our lives are part of some universal script dont you think
3771262 when you were sent by the time lords to alter dalek creation yes i read about that in your diary
3771263 its about time you read something worthwhile anyway yes i altered the history of the daleks slowing down their rise to power the time lords protected the change and stabilised the continuum however i was meaning to run the change through the tardis databanks to project exactly what sort of consequences can arise from it but there was all that business with the time rings and it slipped my mind
3771264 yes yes im sure you can its a moot point though because i did it before coming here
3771265 what do you mean the tardis is linked with the matrix surely it can run a simple time projection
3771266 i know i know perhaps i phrased that badly the tardis is
3771267 the time lords still deny sending me to skaro perhaps they arent just covering up
3771268 what do you mean you met the cia agent on skaro
3771269 and he was definitely a time lord i knew who he was and what he was romana i just never thought of asking from when he came
3771270 how can the daleks ever become a dominant life form anyway the ones we encountered were militarily powerful but not exactly one of the higher life forms
3771271 im sure its nothing doctor the cia probably time locked that to make sure no one can accidentally find out you know what theyre like
3771272 come on dont look like that its not the end of the world
3771273 true and yet sherlock holmes words about an east wind coming is echoing at the back of my mind
3771274 no no but dr watson once saw to jos sprained ankle have i ever told you about that the tardis turned up in 1887
3771275 i could do that all the time do you get to do that all the time
3771276 well its a step up from blowing up a town with a volcano isnt it
3771277 maybe not where you were sunshine from what i remember it was all power cuts and carry on follow that nurse are you listening to me
3771278 barrayar you must have heard of no probably not anyway barrayar yes barrayar brilliant place non stop party honestly its a riot bit of a rocky start when it was first getting out there into the galaxy bit of a dodgy time around then doesnt last by the seventy first century the place to be you should see the fireworks on mardi gras
3771279 sure quite sure you wouldnt rather be out in a ditch somewhere bringing down a totalitarian state
3771280 come on donna lets go and visit their boss i want to make a complaint
3771281 is that its not all about shiny boots and big parades
3771282 youve got a child there and youre calling him emperor look at him hes what ten eleven he should be outside kicking a ball around
3771283 i know it probably doesnt look like it based on the evidence
3771284 but we genuinely are the good guys can you get him to stop we can talk if you get him to stop
3771285 oi mush belt up the lady here wants a word
3771286 and if possible id prefer not to shoot anyone weve been doing so well in recent months
3771287 do you think this could be the dodgy bit you mentioned the rocky start
3771288 would it make life easier all round if we just went
3771289 give us a few more decades you wont recognize the place
3771290 but if youve got some spare time now i thought you might like to see the universe
3771291 ive got this throbbing between my legs and i just dont know what to do about it
3771292 hmmm looks like they didnt add that into your programming no wonder your people were so warlike
3771293 i just touch this clitoris and i can have this orgasm
3771294 i want to see what you do is it so different
3771295 this is how i like it this is how i get an orgasm jenny
3771296 now keep touching yourself i want to watch you have one
3771297 daddy is it supposed to take this long its only getting worse
3771298 you just need to practice its just new to you
3771299 daddy touch me again please it felt so much better when you were doing it
3771300 can we do this again tomorrow daddy i think i need more practice with you
3771301 not staring i was just thinking staring off into space as they say though honestly in the tardis i could do that literally by looking out the front door but no i was just lost in thought thats all
3771302 no you were staring thats okay though i like it when you do
3771303 i see you looking at me when im not wearing any clothes you look like those men in the films that want to fuck
3771304 you know that all i want to do is help you daddy
3771305 why wont you let me help you daddy there is something you want maybe i can help you with it
3771306 i want you to watch me daddy i want you to look at my body and i want you to see me give myself pleasure
3771307 just watch me daddy you like to watch and i love to be seen especially by you
3771308 i want you to wear that dress more often while i work
3771309 come on it looks like there is a storm brewing
3771310 doctor this is my son count miles vorkosigan miles this is the doctor please try not to blow anything up either of you while i go pack a bag
3771311 wait mother what are you pack a bag where are you going vorkosigan surleau will be frozen solid this time of year
3771312 where i dont know earth a thousand years ago barrayar before it was terraformed cetaganda five hundred years from now
3771313 bit of jiggery pokery and you can check in with the kids any time you want
3771314 and now i do miles dont you see now i do im not going mad im just waking up
3771315 i think i know better than most that sometimes they feel the same
3771316 what happened to you this morning you left before before breakfast and came back all
3771317 this morning i watched a sun explode a million years ago and then we went to a planet where they had these animals hexapeds like sergyar the sea was pink and the sky was green and gold and my eyes were the first human eyes to have ever seen a sunrise there
3771318 but thats impossible mother you have to time travels not real its the stuff of fiction and you youre nothing if not a realist
3771319 which might make you conclude dear son that im not on a flight of fancy or going mad but have simply had an experience that realigned my view of the world the universe rather
3771320 id have said it was impossible as well before this morning but the doctor
3771321 this doctor mother i havent exactly spoken to him at length but hes a bit odd dont you think
3771322 but really miles hes a hyperactive narcissistic genius with tendencies toward manic depression somehow i think ill be right at home
3771323 ill give you the hyperactive and the narcissistic and im definitely a genius you got that part right but im not manic depressive well mostly
3771324 usually a good idea to know what people are saying about you and as for your mums sanity
3771325 ill have you know shes one of the sanest people ive ever met and clever whered you think you got your brains
3771326 well yeah but theres clever and then theres clever and your mum is the latter believe me i know im brilliant me but
3771327 you cant possibly expect her to molder in your attic for the next forty years its just wasteful thats what it is
3771328 she wouldnt i dont expect her to molder thats not it at all its not
3771329 i just thought eventually youd figure out what you wanted to do next
3771330 this is it ive been searching and searching for a way not out but on i cant stay here i thought about going back to beta but after forty years that isnt home either and i hate the thought of a two month journey between us
3771331 a million years and no time at all youll see me more this way
3771332 no mother this no were sitting here talking like this is possible but its time travel its a theory it doesnt exist itll never exist
3771333 someone offers you odds on that dont take em especially not if the blokes name is jack harkness
3771334 and in full possession of her faculties no one has done anything to me
3771335 i dont know if youve noticed miles but im a decent judge of character
3771336 mother you cant you cant go swanning off on adventures doing i dont know what for months at a time leaving me here wondering if youre dead or dying or
3771337 miles it is because you are my son and i love you dearly that im going to point out what an absolute howling hypocrite youre being right now
3771338 and one i cant even begin to answer you have everything cordelia
3771339 yes i just want to say good bye to my grandchildren
3771340 im seventy years old i have another fifty years ahead of me if all goes well im a grandmother yes and a mother and a widow but i need to be something else too or ill just go mad
3771341 the doctor has asked me to go traveling with him and i think its exactly what i need just now
3771342 so spur of the moment shouldnt you at least take an armsman countess
3771343 i promise you ill be perfectly fine on my own
3771344 its hard to say it might be sooner than you expect or a bit later
3771345 im just going to see mother off i have the afternoon free though i thought we might take the children out if you like
3771346 if youre going to be living in it i suppose i should
3771347 i imagine therell be mutual looking after there usually is
3771348 you said earth didnt you my favorite actually theres someone i want you to meet oh you and martha will love each other and you dont have enough stories about me yet for it to be really embarrassing well
3771349 i recently closed on a home in the irmo area and must have looked at over 30 homes before finding exactly what i was looking for during my journey to find the right place to call home i met a gentleman that was eager enthusiastic and seemed genuinely excited about making sure i found the right home for me hunter jackson has been a tremendous help in helping me make the right decision and i am very fortunate that our paths crossed throughout the process he continuously told me that he would be there before during and after the deal was done and he has done nothing but follow up on his word his dedication to his profession along with his passion to help others reflects what type of person he is i am in the banking business and deal with quite a few realtors from all over and few provide the accessibility the follow up and most importantly the integrity that hunter jackson and his core values have to offer thanks hunter for all you have done to make 2008 a very special year
3771350 1968 was also the year in which the us abstained from security council resolution 252 demanding israeli withdrawal from conquered arab lands and therein lies a malignancy that has spread to threaten the whole world in 2008
3771351 you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you
3771352 the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
3771353 in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group as such a killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group e forcibly transferring children of the group to another group
3771354 it puts the ordinary consumers in a very difficult position because at some point somebody ought to pay for all of that
3771355 and that begins to create a measure of uncertainty amongst the consumers what the implications are for this new cost structure that eskom has to deal with
3771356 as treasury we have always said that we are engaging with eskom to ensure that at the end of the day we manage this challenge together
3771357 the likely future behaviour of government towards its wholly owned subsidiary
3771358 even a minor negative change in our assumptions surrounding government support would put downward pressure
3771359 these governments recent actions also need to be balanced in the context of previous years where eskom appeared to lack strategic direction and financial support from government
3771360 i used to work before kid came along but now i cant find time
3771361 i have been getting a lot of job offers but i have been refusing them because of the kid
3771362 having a mom around is very important for the child so i dont approve of mom working
3771363 i never took into account the possibility of a capsize
3771364 after experiencing the event when i was in the water myself i could not possibly do the job i was up to my neck in water
3771365 do you accept this was exceptionally bad planning on your part
3771366 i have met the mcintosh family on a number of occasions
3771367 they are shooting a movie or tv show inside goldbar lots of trucks and help wandering around looks like a semi serious production
3771368 we are on track to host the best world cup engineering construction industry grows despite global market volatility matthew hill
3771369 the bells and whistles that got into the technical design
3771370 to a large extent the host city must take responsibility for that
3771371 instead of having a fixed cost tender we have an open ended tender where there are provisional sums that are a huge percentage of the total project costs
3771372 whats important is to create a window period where in terms of servicing those loans the national fiscus takes responsibility over a period of time but ultimately it will be the host city that takes responsibility for that loan

3771381 the doctor dealing with rose being sleepy all the time
3771382 yeah i suppose autons the end of the world and christmas ghosts with charles dickens are a bit much for one day
3771383 ive got some empty rooms you can bunk down in if you like
3771384 here ill show you to a room then you can get some sleep
3771385 what happened today wasnt your fault you just wanted to help im the one that woke it up
3771386 it wasnt your fault either rose trust me and because of you it stopped ive
3771387 ive never seen a dalek do something like that before
3771388 rose tyler you persuaded a dalek not to kill your compassion is so much a part of you that when it took your energy to regenerate itself it couldnt help taking the compassion as well you taught it that theres more to life than killing and thats fantastic
3771389 i dont need as much sleep as you humans do my brain is much more efficient
3771390 are you going to stand outside her door all night
3771391 i imagine youve heard this before but youve got one amazing ship here id heard about the technological feats time lords could perform but until now id never really believed them
3771392 my ship was modified to travel through time but it was a lot more limited
3771393 its pretty obvious how you feel about her you know
3771394 the hands off look you gave me when i came on board was pretty clear
3771395 is why youre standing out here i did mean it when i said i didnt think shed mind if you went in there
3771396 in fact i imagine shed welcome you with open arms
3771397 you dont have to think with your libido just of it
3771398 none of yours either and ive got things to do good night captain
3771399 but rose gave me a chance doc not many people do that especially once they learn im a conman she gave me a chance and she trusted me and i care about her
3771400 yeah she was attracted to me when we met but if you didnt notice what happened when we met up with you i certainly did she was just so aware of you sometimes to the exclusion of everything else i meant it when i said most people notice when theyve been teleported and when i came on board you were the one she danced with not me
3771401 i came by to see how she was and you
3771402 shell never say a word to you about what happened today
3771403 i know her doctor even if shes changed with you she might have said something before she met sarah jane but now after her and madame de pompadour she thinks she knows what the score is shes not going to talk about it not unless you bring it up
3771404 im trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here youd think you hung the moon or somethin the way she defends you but ive seen her through a broken heart before and i dont want to have to do it again
3771405 i didnt ask to come because i wanted to get with rose again of course
3771406 i wouldnt say no if thats what she wanted but im not stupid doctor no matter what you think shes not my girl anymore i just thought she found her place travelling with you and i wanted to find mine too
3771407 even if im not her boyfriend anymore im still her friend and im still watching out for her she may not talk to you about it but i want you to know what youre doing and i want you to think about it
3771408 ive thought about it too much and mickey i cant give her what she needs no matter how much i might want to itd be best for both of us if we didnt get in any deeper than we already are
3771409 and im not going to press you for anything youre not willing to give me
3771410 ive been trying to keep my distance but its been harder than i anticipated and its not working i cant stay away from you rose
3771411 youve been so patient with me im still amazed that you havent left even with all the opportunities ive given you and all the cause i thought you might after reinette i almost wanted you to instead you accepted me you accepted my past and you accepted my future and i dont know how you could do those things when i can barely accept them myself
3771412 im going to lose you someday no matter how much we both want it not to happen and i meant it when i told you im not going to leave you behind i couldnt id be destroying myself and you dont have to tell me that im being melodramatic because i know how i sound and maybe i am being melodramatic but it still feels like that like youd take part of me with you and id just fall to pieces without that part and without you
3771413 whether you want to or not you will it might be in ten months or ten years or ten decades but in what will seem such a short time to me youll be gone and ill never have you back i dont know what thats going to do to me if the glimpse i got when i saw you without your face was any indication its not going to be good you keep me centred rose its so much easier to be the man i want to be when i have you beside me what will happen to me when youre gone
3771414 as much as im afraid to be without you being with you is wonderful sometimes i even manage to forget that my people are gone and the space they occupied in my head is empty you make me feel happy and at peace i dont think i have the words to tell you what that means to me
3771415 was that just out of enthusiasm for bein alive and together again
3771416 well i am quite enthusiastic about being alive and together
3771417 and i wouldnt have done that if we werent alive and together of course
3771418 the truth is rose i just got tired of fighting what we both want
3771419 but i want you to be sure its what you really want no changin your mind later because i could handle our relationship staying the way it is now but i dont think i could handle us moving forward and you regretting it
3771420 if we do this it has to be because you honestly want it not because youre tired of fighting it
3771421 all the reasons i had before for fighting it just arent as important as the reasons for giving in i was afraid of my feelings for you making me weak but they dont rose they make me
3771422 the console rooms not very comfortable for this sort of thing
3771423 its got pillows sheets a mattress covers what could it possibly be missing
3771424 were still wearing everything but shoes and in my case socks and my suit jacket
3771425 im not that different from a human male rose the universe tends to take patterns that work and repeat them with only a few changes sex works mostly the same way
3771426 welllll theres the mental aspect of it but i think thats the only thing youd be unfamiliar with
3771427 sex was as much mental as it was physical with my people along with the physical merging there was a mental component were just more open mentally than humans are and it happened naturally its difficult to describe
3771428 is that all right i know you werent exactly happy when you found out the tardis was in your head
3771429 and that was when i barely knew you or her i dont mind
3771430 i hadnt quite expected my barriers to drop so completely though maybe its because youre human and dont have real barriers of your own
3771431 your barriers that would be when i felt you more completely in my head
3771432 i er sorry about that i hadnt wanted to overwhelm you like that
3771433 its just been so long since anyone has seen me that deeply and im not always well the best person in the universe rose
3771434 theres a lot in my mind i wouldnt ordinarily show you
3771435 theres a lot i didnt absorb really i was a bit distracted you know
3771436 but doctor ive always wanted to know you better maybe parts of you are beyond me but what i can understand i want to
3771437 even with the parts that were unexpected was that somethin youd like to do again
3771438 it was rather brilliant if i do say so myself
3771439 dont let this go to your head but i think youve tired me out

3771451 by choosing to travel by rail amtrak passengers are already a step ahead because the carbon footprint generated by their trip is smaller than that of most other modes of transportation

3771490 inflation may have shown signs of slowing down but it doesnt mean that the bsp will no longer be watchful of any emerging risk to inflation
3771491 looks like inflation has lost steam because prices of oil and food have gone down
3771492 moderation in inflation does not necessarily mean that our baseline forecasts have been changed the view that inflation is expected to kick in october still remains it may have moderated but it remains elevated

3771517 by then the technical minor glitches experienced in this years armm elections normally expected in pilot exercises will have been fully addressed
3771518 the us economy still looks weak and this will lead to weaker exports from asia domestic demand cannot be disaggregated from exports because once those working in export oriented factories lose their jobs they will have less money to spend on consumer goods at home
3771519 despite the rise of domestic consumption in asia many economies remain dependent on exports to developed states for their growth
3771520 our clients tell us they want to be in asia property and we go where our clients want to go
3771521 regardless of the downturn in the us and europe there is a strong domestic need particularly in india and china that continues to fuel demand for housing and retail
3771522 its because i devoted myself heart and soul in this match
3771523 if we thought we were finished we would have lost
3771524 thats what the chinese do so well against us they fight when theyre down then come back
3771525 they never give us anything so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3771526 i just want to get on with the next match now
3771527 eating basically free of cholesterol no saturated fat only extra virgin olive oil no butter all the portions are a little bit smaller than normal salt is a little bit less like sugar is a little bit less without compromising the taste the quality of the food you do not need to have any feeling that the dish is lacking in any other ingredient just to make it healthy you do not have to eliminate this kind of complement but you need to make it with other ingredients
3771528 each dish is really analyzed by our dietologist sic in hong kong peninsula group a normal portion of salmon tartar in the menu is only 200 calories 80 grams of salmon diced and five grams of extra virgin olive oil with regard to fat saturated fat is zero and normal fat only 2 3 2 or 3 grams so its obviously very very low our normal dose of fat is like 35 grams per day we balance with the other ingredients so its very minimal
3771529 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident

3771564 mr gould submitted a us 12 000 budget to the ministry of youth and sports for ten persons government accepted the budget but there was no money so we decided to seek funding from other areas which they wrestling federation agreed to
3771565 we tried to no avail to get money although there were tickets for athletes accommodations and feeding for ten persons but that government sponsor four persons we still could not get the money so we talked to george kailondo to credit money for gould and me minister gray thereby dropping the journalist and medic
3771566 the lnoc issued a ticket for gould to travel two days after the athletes and head coach left for senegal before then gould told me to do a letter to him so that the bank could give us a loan we gave him the letter but there was no money this is the very letter he is now using to say we passed the budget without giving the athletes per diem
3771567 we wrote leno travel agency and were credited a ticket to be paid for this budget year since gould took us 400 00 from the lnoc as per diem so kailondo gave me the balance us 3 000 for athletes per diem and incidental
3771568 i met gould in abidjan where i made him sign for us 1 550 00 for the five athletes and coach before reaching senegal i told the organizers that the athletes would be in cote divoire for ten hours so they should change the route the organizers gave mr gould an amount of 100 000 cfa as expenses made by the athletes but mr gould refused to give the money to the athletes
3771569 i returned us 360 00 in governments account eventhough gould wanted me to give him the money for the athletes

3771578 despite the global recessionary trends mounting inflation and prospects of elections in the near future privately held businesses phbs in india have shown the highest level of optimism about their prospects for next year
3771579 with an overall optimism pessimism balance of 95 per cent the philippines has joined india at the top for the first time while japan has remained at the bottom this year with a balance of 49 per cent
3771580 phbs in india are less optimistic about their revenue prospects in 2008 84 per cent compared to 2007 92 per cent however their levels of optimism regarding revenue performance are well above the global average of 63 per cent
3771581 economic growth is expected to ease back in the coming quarters and years
3771582 the economy has been slowing since the middle of 2007 08 and growth will continue to ease as the recent rounds of policy tightening and the impact of recent currency appreciation continues to feed through
3771583 domestic demand will continue to drive growth in the short term supported by strengthening exports as this sector continues to gain competitiveness although short term gains may be more moderate owing to the weaker global economy

3771593 the financial performance for the past fiscal represents a significant milestone for cgcs
3771594 the company achieved a respectable operating profit margin for the first time in several years since the bursting of the telecom market bubble cgcs has focused on winning business in the military and industrial markets from large multinational customers who are focused on the oil amp gas medical devices and document printing markets as well as certain mission critical military programs this up tick in business puts the company on a positive growth trajectory whereby revenues will grow at double digit rates next year
3771595 this is a great opportunity to take part in a unique backyard conservation project our studies will help us understand the role this creature plays in keeping water clean keeping the numbers of unwelcome pests down and generally managing local ecosystems volunteers who offer up the use of their ponds will be making a real difference to a british conservation project
3771596 we believe that these creatures play a fundamental part in maintaining the ecosystems contained within our streams and rivers if the white crayfish are lost then plant and animal biodiversity could be badly affected
3771597 john mccain may not have a head made out of a genetically modified cow meat and cheese but he has my support
3771598 mccain is a president who will protect mcdonaldland from terrorists who wish to disrupt our way of life and take away our freedom fries
3771599 john mccain has ensured me that if elected he will put an end to the frivolous 1973 sid and marty krofft lawsuit which threatens our very existence make no mistake john is the man for the job
3771600 it was during his years that the mcdonalds organization and mcdonaldland in particular rose into the american consciousness i have a cherished framed picture of myself shaking nixons hand hanging in my library im still loving it
3771601 mayor mccheese is a true american who is now facing a vast liberal conspiracy
3771602 it may be attributed to the international orientation of the journal including the close collaboration with springer the periodically recycled international editorial board and the significant increase of international submissions
3771603 moreover with springers flexible distribution channels and marketing strategies accessibility of aas has also greatly improved since 2006 which is shown in aass subscription increase and downloading rates
3771604 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
3771605 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
3771606 the fact that the parasite actively uses a component of the host hemoglobin as a way to protect itself against the defenses of the host is an interesting facet of the biology of parasites we discovered that the two subspecies of t brucei that can infect humans both possess tbhphpr
3771607 as the receptor shows equal affinity for the human specific hpr hb complex and the hp hb complex in contrast to the analogous human receptor cd163 which cannot bind hpr hb we deduce that tbhphbr is a parasite specific entry site for hpr hb thus the hprhb complex could be coupled to toxins and used as a novel drug against the parasite targeting only the parasite and not the host
3771608 our next step is to contribute to the development of these new conjugate drugs using the receptor as an entry point into the parasite the assay using a biacore system developed during this investigation will be essential for assessing binding of drug candidates to the receptor
3771609 when people continue to die and the outbreak continues to spread then officials undertake late fire fighting measures to combat the outbreak
3771610 afterwards the officials forget what occurred and eventually wait for the next report of cholera due to the lack of a comprehensive control program such a pattern repeats itself time after time
3771611 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3771612 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3771613 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology
3771614 its heading to the point where it is zero cost to the taxpayer whats brought in revenue almost takes care of the whole ems department budget thats everything weve given her the figures theyve given us nothing weve asked ten times to show us where your concerns are nothing
3771615 im not confident that what were getting is giving us the full picture the program had to have cost more than 17 000
3771616 we dont have any receipts we have been asking over and over and over again i dont know if it creates revenue
3771617 because i can see from the accounting records that what were losing our net loss is over 400 000 a year
3771618 in looking at the numbers there is no separate budget for the lifeguard program theyre all meshed into one weve even asked independent people if they can pull out what it costs exactly for this program
3771619 its really generated from personal vendettas i think theres people and theres only a few that have been able to get in the ear of the supervisor i think the names are well known out there
3771620 they perceive that folks like myself are targeting them and have contact with the town supervisor and that were targeting ems management and this is one way to get back at them which is absolutely false
3771621 i havent seen any actual demonstrations of liability in my time as medical director here either in safety or in patient care
3771622 since last november u s drivers have driven 53 2 billion fewer miles than they did over the same period a year earlier topping the 1970s total drop in u s miles traveled of 49 3 billion miles that was caused by several recessions and spikes in gasoline prices during the decade
3771623 the decline in miles traveled since last november has occurred the most in rural areas where travel has fallen by 4 percent compared to the 1 2 percent drop in urban miles traveled the department detailed

3771649 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3771650 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3771651 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3771652 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
3771653 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3771654 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

3771675 if you look at it as a fan youre like were used to being 10 0 well nobodys going 10 0 in our region
3771676 if they do they are an extremely strong team its an extremely tough region we play in and i wont cry any tears after its broken up for 2009
3771677 we were ranked no 1 or 2 in the state we had an opportunity to go up 17 0 in that game but instead we fumbled and turned the ball over and had a big momentum swing in the game
3771678 i told our players this year that we were a fumble away from going into the last game of our regular season at 9 0 and probably still ranked no 1 in the state if we entered that game against farragut 9 0 riding all that momentum then we play a different game
3771679 that was easily our worst game of the year farragut had a lot to do with that but we didnt show what we were capable of last years season was disappointing in our expectations but in the grand scheme of things id rather be 8 3 than 5 5 like in 2006
3771680 i want to go with people remembering this senior class and i want to go out there and show we can do good things
3771681 those seniors are very familiar with some of the problems that have plagued us the past couple of years
3771682 i think they have made an effort to fix them
3771683 so far weve had a really good work ethic a great attitude and good leadership
3771684 thats the key for us as far as im concerned for us to have positive results and so far theyve done a super job
3771685 weve got to work hard and stay focused and see what we can do with it
3771686 this is a great challenge its a great community the people here have been very supportive of me
3771687 youre never satisfied with a loss but three years ago we had a very embarrassing loss to them alcoa
3771688 that had a lot to do with how we approached our seasons the last few years we lost some good seniors 14 of them which are hard to replace
3771689 but we have a good senior class this year to back that up and continue a winning tradition of our school
3771690 here recently ive been working on my footwork and getting my speed down
3771691 its good to have an all star quarterback back there
3771692 he can put the ball wherever he wants it its up to us to catch it
3771693 you know that someone with that experience whatever he says is like gold in our ears what he says we listen to he has all the experience
3771694 he feels comfortable hes also a leader when he talks everyone listens it was surprising how well he took on a leadership role as a freshman
3771695 were going to run the wing t so were not going to put a lot of pressure on the quarterback but if you can get a quarterback to come in and all of a sudden is making plays then it opens up your offense
3771696 i dont want to be overconfident with it but im looking forward to getting the pads on and seeing what these guys can do
3771697 he may be the most talented freshman running back ive seen hell compete to start
3771698 i think well step it up a little bit better
3771699 i dont put a whole lot of moves on people
3771700 i think big things are going to happen to michael this year
3771701 hes very smart he understands the game he understands what were doing
3771702 what i talked to the players about this year its that theres now a tradition
3771703 theres a standard thats been set its kind of something that the momentum of last year has carried over and the work ethic that was established last year has just continued to grow and has carried over
3771704 i tell these guys our conference is up this year every week when we line up weve got to be ready to play i believe in these kids i believe in what im seeing them do i see a change of attitude
3771705 we have great coaches weve really come together hopefully we can turn that around turn that 2 8 record to 8 2
3771706 weve got to get past the woe is me attitude
3771707 i really believe when bad things happen this year these kids wont let it happen regardless these kids have earned my respect and my confidence in them
3771708 morale and moral wise the group we have this year is going to be a step above what we have had in the past
3771709 we are not rebuilding but we did lose the biggest number of seniors eight
3771710 and jordan is a wonderful leader as well defensively he seems to be in the right place at the right time and offensively he helps with blocking schemes
3771711 if they make the big plays we come out looking good
3771712 we are hoping to play off the success of last year
3771713 we have a younger team but we are hoping to get another year like last year
3771714 this team has the potential to be as good as it wants to be
3771715 contrary to coachs belief sometimes i can make the transition
3771716 i played there in middle school and itll just be about getting my steps down
3771717 our team is familiar with the new offense now and were more experienced stronger and faster
3771718 i dont think weve beaten region 1 rival dobyns bennett in that long
3771719 chris has been doing stuff like that since we were in grasshopper leagues
3771720 hes waited his turn last year he had a lot of big plays nine touchdowns or something like that hes had a great summer
3771721 we need him to carry the torch he needs to be the leader and catch a lot of balls
3771722 its our job to figure out what they do best and put them into positions to succeed
3771723 the thing is with coach quarles you know you have the best quarterbacks coach around here and in tennessee
3771724 hes always finding ways as youve seen the last couple of years to find a way with quarterbacks to make them the best they can be
3771725 it makes the third string guy want to be the first string guy it makes the first string guy want to push and not want to get beat out he has that little something that clicks in your head that makes you work
3771726 you dont want to be the senior class that loses the first game since 2003
3771727 we have to not take anybody lightly and prepare the same
3771728 well worry about those others in between on fridays but weve got those two circled we want to start winning and end winning
3771729 chase at 6 foot 5 210 pounds is going to be tough for high school defensive backs to handle
3771730 a kid that big that strong and who can jump that high is just going to be tough to keep up with
3771731 principal perry came in and told these guys not to pay attention to what they read in the paper about their school or their football team
3771732 the seniors we had last year most of them played since their sophomore year to get to the semifinals again will be extremely difficult
3771733 as the season progresses hopefully well come together meld together and well see what happens
3771734 they might not have all started but they played a lot
3771735 they know what it takes like travis roberson they know what it takes to be successful
3771736 i think ryan or whoever the quarterback is their job is not to be as much a playmaker as a distributor
3771737 were really going to work hard at getting the football to who we need to get it to in the skill guys hands
3771738 he can make big plays he has big play potential maybe even more big play potential than we had last year out of one person
3771739 ive played with a winning team ive got to teach them what they need to do to win and how to practice every day to be successful
3771740 time will tell if theyll be as disciplined about their goals as the class that just graduated
3771741 one of our strengths will be our depth the competition within our team will be great
3771742 were excited about this season the guys have worked really hard during the offseason well see what happens
3771743 ive gotten a bit stronger and am about the same speed
3771744 now i know how the offense runs im more accustomed to the offense knowing im going to be the no 1 guy gives me more confidence i know what to do and when to do it and i know what other people are going to do
3771745 the other day in the store some guy in the store asked me about who we played first and all this other stuff about who were playing
3771746 weve probably got more kids coming back than anybody in the region
3771747 if were gonna make a run this should be the year this team has got that kind of potential
3771748 he has got a big time arm and has really done a better job this spring and summer being a leader
3771749 zeke has gotten a lot faster last year he ran a 4 75 or 4 8 40 yard dash
3771750 coleman is a special kid hes like a coach on the field
3771751 weve not had a lot of players like young hes a kid who can take it to the house two steps and hes at full speed

3771768 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
3771769 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3771770 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3771771 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california

3771795 what can happen with curvier women is they have to size up in order to accommodate perhaps more weight that theyre carrying in their hips and the waistband can then tend to not fit snugly around their waist which leads to a little bit of an unfinished type of look

3771863 the defenders will have to be good one versus one and have a sound
3771864 they have to be comfortable attacking on the dribble tackling and distributing the ball after we regain possession we are a bit inexperienced on the back line but have a nice mix of talent with our returners and newcomers
3771865 the key for our midfielders will be making a quick transition from defense to offense we expect our defensive midfielders to maintain possession cover a lot of ground and be good in the air while switching the point of attack

3771912 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
3771913 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
3771914 the question is whether this is an integral part of the physiology of the retina
3771915 once you understand the normal retina you can determine the basis of retinal disorders

3771917 this will help us to understand on which types of ecosystems they might have a large impact or small impact and under which conditions they are going to be able to thrive
3771918 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3771919 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3771920 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

3771935 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials
3771936 the conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas

3771938 the pentagon says no civilians were killed in an air strike sunday in a remote area of eastern afghanistan which local officials say killed 27 people who were walking to a wedding

3771971 like all great satire the book is cerebral irreverent and hilarious while also edifying
3771972 this book is hilarious lanham didnt skimp on his research the book provides a telling overview of the religious rights leadership the beliefs they espouse and just how incredibly absurd and hypocritical they are

3771975 a handbook for coping with bible thumpers when considering the power and influence evangelical christians wield in this country you have to laugh to keep from crying robert lanham understands this well and offers much needed totally biased comic relief
3771976 not only is this an important book its a funny book
3771977 author robert lanham is an observer but with his latest the sinners guide to the evangelical right lanhams keen eye has hit perhaps his most entertaining target
3771978 it s hard to remember a more pointed and scathing attack lanham launches a focused sustained barrage on the pat robertsons and james dobsons of the world he s done his homework

3771992 id better keep going because i might screw the shot up
3771993 brand of race neutrality shows black politics is obsolete and should be abandoned
3771994 to the extent that african americans expect more from barack obama than they got from bill clinton they will be devastatingly disappointed
3771995 for a lot of younger african americans the resistance of the civil rights generation to obamas candidacy signified the failure of their parents to come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle to embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
3771996 could not come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle
3771997 the generational transition that is reordering black politics didnt start this year it has been happening gradually and quietly for at least a decade as younger african americans barack obama among them have challenged their elders in traditionally black districts what this years democratic nomination fight did was to accelerate that transition
3771998 several black operatives and politicians with whom i spoke worried eloquently that an obama presidency might actually leave black americans less well represented in washington rather than more so that in fact the end of black politics if that is what we are witnessing might also mean the precipitous decline of black influence
3771999 the argument here is that a president obama closely watched for signs of parochialism or racial resentment would have less maneuvering room to champion spending on the urban poor say or to challenge racial injustice whats more his very presence in the rose garden might undermine the already tenuous case for affirmative action in hiring and school admissions

3772125 until i say differently im going to keep all the quarterbacks alive the coach explained
3772126 i feel good about all three of them j t is the newest product to what weve got so im getting a longer look at him
3772127 a little bit more continuity but no final decisions were made
3772128 maybe i dont know i really have no idea kind of wish i did i wish we were a little more in the light on things
3772129 i try not to think about that or read into anything right now smith said
3772130 i think the more you do that the more its going to hurt you out there on the field with your play
3772131 do i see it as my job to lose now
3772132 its strictly about me going out there and trying to play as well as i can play unfortunately i dont get to make the decision if i got to make the decision that would be easy for me
3772133 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3772134 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3772135 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3772136 this is a big loss for our defense because rashaad is not only a leader on the field but off the field as well
3772137 creating a way to run the ball is our no
3772138 weve got to create some run game and get ourselves going in the right direction
3772139 i felt like a receiver last year but there were a lot of holes in my game
3772140 the company has made good progress in improving the performance of the dominican republic facility during the third quarter although its inventory levels for activewear continue to be very low
3772141 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3772142 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3772143 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3772144 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3772145 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3772146 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3772147 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3772148 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3772149 the reality is i dont think were very good right now as a team
3772150 whatever that first exhibition game was were going to have a big test going into tennessee on friday against that team if we dont have our stuff right and our guys arent right well get run out of that stadium real quick
3772151 if you have bad days on sundays you get beat and beat bad if you want to be a great team you cant have bad days
3772152 theyre still good but he had been so exceptional and almost perfect that he made some normal mistakes that rookies make over the last two practices so it will be good to see him rebound
3772153 tell mom we left a popsicle stick on the counter to see how many ants we could collect theyre all over the counter and in the sink

3772184 the japanese did a study on him took him into a scientific lab and broke down all of his anatomy
3772185 it showed that the wing span is 203 centimetres and his height is 193 centimetres usually height matches arm length so hes already got this extra reach
3772186 then his shoe size is 14 where most are 12 at most and that gives him an extra 10 per cent efficiency everything about him physically is stacked in his favour
3772187 so where most people do a dolphin kick and try to kick from the ribs he can do it all the way from the chest which in this case gives him 20 efficiency thats why you see him stay under water so long and why it is so easy when he comes up
3772188 for him all that is pretty effortless and then hes got that energy to continue swimming on top of the water
3772189 when spitz did it there were maybe five or six countries that had the sort of sophisticated programs we see from all over the world today
3772190 that he has the depth and capacity to do it in so many kinds of events spitz was basically freestyle and butterfly is amazing
3772191 usually you cant breaststroke to save your life if you are a freestyler
3772192 i feel its better than the cfl nfl is real football
3772193 this is cfl country and everyone needs to know it
3772194 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3772195 despite some bright spots our summer olympic team is not very good
3772196 diving is not here to support canada on its own
3772197 the games have just started people are still training for their events theyre still competing and the medals are going to come
3772198 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3772199 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3772200 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3772201 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
3772202 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3772203 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3772204 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3772205 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3772206 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3772207 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3772208 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3772209 work together to develop initiatives to introduce search marketing as a career choice for new entrants to the industry as well as develop additional training and education opportunities for those professionals already in the workforce

3772214 the government of canada is pleased to announce funding to celebrate this important event for the acadian community especially for the acadians from prince edward island
3772215 we are proud to partner with a well known organization like the carrefour de lisle saint jean to support an event celebrating acadian history and heritage
3772216 the deportation of the acadians was a tragic event that has marked our history its important to celebrate this anniversary to remember our origins and share our history and values with future generations
3772217 i am proud that our government has taken decisive steps to help commemorate this event and the accomplishments of all acadians
3772218 the support we receive from the department of canadian heritage is essential to the success of our event which will celebrate heritage in charlottetown birthplace of confederation
3772219 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored

3772228 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the uk means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
3772229 the capacity increase will not only contribute significantly to cornwalls overall renewables targets but further endorses our credentials as a developer of even the most challenging uk wind projects
3772230 energywatch is currently providing a crucial service to thousands of businesses who are confused and frustrated by energy suppliers
3772231 if a super consumer group is to be established as the government plans there is little doubt in my mind that this service will be all but lost leaving companies at the mercy of the suppliers an obvious solution would be establishing a separate watchdog dedicated to assisting businesses

3772245 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3772246 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3772247 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3772248 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3772249 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3772250 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3772251 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3772252 i thought once we came back i felt pretty good about our chances
3772253 their pinch hitter did a heck of a job he doubled down the line coming off the bench and thats outstanding
3772254 he could have walked in there and talked to the pitcher but he was motioning to me
3772255 he wasnt quite looking at the pitcher when the threw over there which was why jeff threw it wild
3772256 we came back and got the big hit with two outs in the ninth inning unfortunately we didnt execute in the bottom of the ninth inning
3772257 weve got a good lineup from top to bottom and ive seen us hit for a week and a half to two weeks
3772258 theres no doubt were going to go up there and put some solid at bats together we pushed towards coming back and we did its a sign of the kind of team we have
3772259 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3772260 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3772261 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3772262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3772263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3772264 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3772265 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3772266 the capacity increase will not only contribute significantly to cornwalls overall renewables targets but further endorses our credentials as a developer of even the most challenging uk wind projects
3772267 accelerate the offshore wind wave and tidal energy projects in scotland

3772320 jai is such a giver that she often forgets to take care of herself
3772321 when we become physically or emotionally run down we cant help anybody else least of all small children

3772323 we discuss we get frustrated we get mad we make up
3772324 i owe jai many apologies but do we really want to spend our last months together arguing that i havent hung up my khakis we do not so now jai kicks my clothes in a corner and moves on

3772326 i cant imagine rolling over in bed and youre not there
3772327 i cant picture myself taking the kids on vacation and you not being with us

3772343 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3772347 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3772348 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3772353 bobbi threw me a curve ball with the lip colors in the mauve collection her new fall makeup line id been searching high and low for edgy yet wearable lipsticks and glosses in shades of purple and these colors are dare i say edgy yet wearable theyre eye catching without going over the top and within the colors theres enough variety to allow you to create lots of different looks go on with your bad self ms brown
3772354 when it comes to pink lipsticks i am a one woman army ive been hoarding them since high school my arsenal is such that if hostile aliens landed and the fate of the world hinged on our ability to scare them away with tubes of pink lipstick the earth would prevail id whip out one of my new favorite pink shades for fall bobbi browns pretty pink metallic lip color 22 and wave it above my head like a light saber
3772355 the three pastel colors from bobbis metallic collection make it easy to fake a bright eyed bushy tailed look all three colors are highly pigmented with excellent color payoff theyre also easy to blend and apply lasting all day long with nary a crease
3772356 fall may be months away but the collection just arrived at chanel counters nationwide i fell in love with five of the products in this release two of the glossimers delight and gold light facettes dor highlighter in gold fever and two of the lipsticks pepeete and formentera
3772357 part of the chanel fall 2008 makeup collection formentera shines like mad yet feels whisper light on my lips its a pretty option when you want the staying power of a lipstick with the shine of a gloss
3772358 take a break from all the berry and chocolate dominating this falls makeup collections and take a look at clarins their jazzy colours collection evokes the carefree elegance of the roaring twenties and its grey blue and rose shades make me want to dance the charleston in a fringe dress ha all i need now is a bob haircut
3772359 lets take a moment to wax philosophic about an upcoming fall collection slated for a summertime release diors fall 2008 impression cuir makeup collection no matter what dior calls it this collection looks hot put on your water wings grab some sweet tea or gin and juice haay and take a look
3772360 dior is at it again girls i love dior in general but their eyeshadow quints are what i look forward to most of all this august theyre giving us two new palettes for fall oh be still my broken knee
3772361 check out essies fall polish line 8 each keeping in character for fall the collection features deep plum berry and cherry shades that look good enough to eat im always hungry lol sometimes i shy away from uber dark shades because of how obvious it can be when they chip so im glad essie decided not to go too vampire dark with these colors
3772362 with lots of eyeshadows lipsticks and glosses in colors inspired by berries caramels and chocolate this collection could have been by willy wonka arent the swirl patterns tasty
3772363 seeing these lippmann collection fall nail polish colors 15 each for the first time i thought one thing vegas baby the red black white and black purple colors remind me of playing cards
3772364 what makes cult of cherry noteworthy for me its the rich reds dark plums and chocolate browns the collection includes nine lipsticks four mattenes two blushes five lipglasses three eye shadow quads two nail polishes and zoom lash mascara also part of macs permanent collection
3772365 i suppose my love for the city in fall explains why ive fallen for sally hansens new nail collection inspired by 10 fall colors created in collaboration with clothing designer tracy reese the industrial grey black and blue shades contrast well with maroons and neutrals as do the streets of my favorite city in the fall
3772366 these are not people who will disappear quietly theyre accustomed to hardship and slights and theyll fight for new orleans this film will showcase the struggle for new orleans by focusing on the profound loss as well as the indomitable spirit of new orleaneans
3772367 babencos imagery is realistic but his point of view is shockingly lyrical
3772368 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat
3772369 but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through that adjustment
3772370 broadly flat output means there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3772371 the august inflation report is consistent with a resumption of the interest rate cutting cycle before the end of the year
3772372 it is inevitable absolutely inevitable that as peoples living standards fall they will seek to compensate for that
3772373 there are only so many notches on the belt to tighten
3772374 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3772375 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3772376 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3772377 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3772378 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3772379 sometimes i think about it when she works late and im going to bed
3772380 he trails off with a what can you do groan
3772381 she hardly ever wears her wedding ring even off set
3772382 i want her to be happy and its a turn on in a way on the downside though there are guys having sex with your wife
3772383 i look at it as a guy with his dick in my wife but theyre working and its not emotional she never orgasms in porn thats for us if it happened on the set it would be a little weird
3772384 i got a text message from her that said ive been ripped
3772385 get that text and you know its no sex for a few days
3772386 i constantly made epsom salt baths and forced her to get in it burns the cut but also helps it to heal faster
3772387 it wasnt a big deal either way but once you start you cant undo it
3772388 girlfriends of mine call and say that they want to come by for a swim

3772392 we went with a couple of my girlfriends to hang out in their hotel room
3772393 then this music producer dude showed up and all of a sudden these girls were running around in their panties

3772402 why you should see dr dog tonight at rittenhouse square
3772403 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3772404 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
3772405 wed start shooting at nine or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
3772406 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3772407 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3772408 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
3772409 this is supposed to be the informal part of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
3772410 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way
3772411 the fact that he wasnt controlled wasnt reading prepared lines it was raw and it was powerful and i think it was who he really was
3772412 were still just trying to get him right we havent gotten that far yet
3772413 right now were just in the process of getting a support staff set up in philadelphia weve made some direction there weve just got to go in the right direction for shawn
3772414 he had told me hed been working out we put him through some things here the past couple days
3772415 wills you over with its charm its sense of mischief and its pure scottishness
3772416 russia is putting those aspirations at risk by taking action inconsistent with the principles of these organisations
3772417 every 12 year old boy should have that type of experience
3772418 i remember when our manager told us we were going to the little league world series were all saying wheres that
3772419 we had no idea we were playing to go to the little league world series
3772420 well i hit a three run homer in my first at bat and i got intentionally walked the next four times
3772421 i guess that honor stuff went right out the window
3772422 we went back home for the summer and did what every 12 year old would do at that time we went back to playing sandlot baseball for the rest of the summer
3772423 i guess the beauty of the whole thing is that we were 12 years old it was just a baseball game
3772424 i often wonder about what it wouldve been like if wed won it
3772425 but i think the fact is that game for me it probably really had a defining moment as far as who i would become in life it certainly had a dramatic impact on my life
3772426 i think im starting to get old cause im starting not to remember a lot of things
3772427 it looks like the ball is coming out of his hand well
3772428 hes not 100 percent yet hes not throwing his bullpens at 100 percent velocity hes not throwing breaking balls yet but the signs are definitely positive
3772429 not anywhere close to getting anything done but that doesnt mean they are a long ways apart either

3772438 this transaction will not affect our employees or the service we provide to more than 7 million texas consumers
3772439 there are people who dont agree with something and they try to express themselves you have people like this in your country
3772440 i am calling to ask governor schwarzenegger to veto any pro illegal alien legislation like the california dream act and to do more to combat illegal immigration on the state level his promise to keep ca from giving licenses to illegal aliens is not enough a historic number of states have voted to crack down on illegal immigration this year and no states have passed laws that give benefits to illegal aliens yet we need california to do a better job of fighting illegal immigration and we need governor schwarzenegger to show some backbone on this issue
3772441 im calling to ask governor rick perry to do more to combat illegal immigration in texas he should consider calling the tx legislature into a special emergency session to address the issue since many state lawmakers have indicated they want to pass immigration enforcement legislation as soon as possible texas is becoming a border disaster area due to illegal immigration and many texans are dying because of the lack of federal and state action
3772442 im calling to ask immigration and customs enforcement to increase the number of raids the numbers of illegal aliens arrested and the number of employers charged with crimes nationally with special focus on the high impact states of california and texas recent studies show that immigration enforcement encourages many illegal aliens to leave on their own americas illegal immigration crisis is the result of ices under enforcement of our existing immigration laws i want to see ice go into high gear and crack down hard nationally and in ca and tx

3772450 hostilities must cease as soon as possible and urgent steps must be taken to help the victims the humanitarian catastrophe regretfully received very little coverage in western media this weekend and to rebuild the devastated towns and villages
3772451 we are not aware of any australians harmed by the heightened conflict
3772452 no one will say it out loud but the lack of uptake in honours maths in ireland is due to teacher performance
3772453 the teaching of maths is the single most important factor in a childs education and the fact of the matter is the education system cannot surpass beyond the quality of its teachers
3772454 talk of the maths failure rate being an international problem is a cop out
3772455 we have the potential to improve the interest in maths science and engineering but were not creative enough to take the right steps
3772456 this is a real economic issue for ireland in terms of companies that rely on students coming out of engineering and computer courses we are asleep when it comes to maths and we are just hitting the snooze button when maths points are brought up were just not getting out of bed on the issue and this could be disastrous for the economy
3772457 maths is the language of the knowledge economy we have to address teacher performance a whole series of steps are needed but it requires bravery at the department of education and science
3772458 some of these people only have to do a module as part of one year at teacher training college to be qualified to teach honours maths we have to acknowledge the fact that honours maths requires special treatment
3772459 all technology companies are finding it hard to get irish talent smes are finding it hard and they are competing against organisations like google intel and ibm if an organisation has 20 polish it engineers in a high cost location like dublin surely someone in head office is going to be asking why dont they have an office in a lower cost location like poland this is potentially a very serious issue for the economy and no one seems brave enough to take the steps that need taking
3772460 there is still resistance from young people to engineering and science training in schools and colleges and there continues to be an ongoing shying away from these so called hard subjects
3772461 it is the governments responsibility to foster the countrys economic interests and a key element of this is an education system that equips students to face the modern world and solve the challenges of today and the future
3772462 maths has been a cause for concern for some time and obviously the 12pc failure rate is disappointing the government is aware reform is needed at second level as there is not adequate understanding of mathematical concepts
3772463 we aim to ensure this changes by introducing project maths in 24 schools this september which is a new concept to bring about a cultural change in the teaching of maths
3772464 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3772465 they were in a two vehicle convoy they were american canadian and irish
3772466 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3772467 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3772468 we dont know yet how many men carried out the attack
3772469 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3772470 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
3772471 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3772472 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3772473 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3772474 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3772475 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3772476 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3772477 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3772478 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3772479 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3772480 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3772481 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3772482 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3772483 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
3772484 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3772485 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3772486 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3772487 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3772488 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3772489 if guinness want to keep the irish harp on the pint of stout
3772490 some say the devil is dead and buried in killarney more say he rose again and joined the
3772491 the brit should be sacked and an irishman should not be let go
3772492 no irishman is going out of the gate while we employ a brit
3772493 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3772494 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3772495 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3772496 i just keep saying to myself greatest olympian of all time over and over
3772497 it hasnt sunk in yet but its a great thing to hear people say it
3772498 hes just a normal person although maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3772499 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3772500 im just trying to get through everything its a lot of racing and its not easy
3772501 i am trying to take one race at a time
3772502 it is a sad situation in georgia and i would like to thank fifa for thinking about that and we will wait to see what fifa decide
3772503 i know that fifa will think about the calendar and for me it is important that the game will be played on september 6
3772504 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team
3772505 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
3772506 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it
3772507 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon alongside physical attacks the benefits of using such methods are that no one is directly physically hurt or killed and it is much harder to pinpoint the source and who is involved
3772508 furthermore cost makes this a really appealing option as it is far less expensive and more simple to instigate than a full scale military attack yet still creates maximum levels of destruction as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies and severely impact the running of services governments need to have in place strategies to prepare for this type of attack and to ensure that resources can be sustained at all times
3772509 ballymoney has a lot slower pace of life than the big towns and its a very friendly place
3772510 clearly where you live is very important workplace home environment health and social services available whether the roads are safe and good community feeling
3772511 you cant find an answer to the question just by looking at the roscommon area
3772512 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3772513 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3772514 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3772515 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay
3772516 its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together
3772517 ive always watched the road to croker its a great show and im delighted that ill have the opportunity to present it on august 21
3772518 just have to clear the head look at the kerry mountains and see what i need to do next
3772519 young children and adults with serious dental issues are being made to suffer because of consistent underfunding of this state scheme
3772520 the hse does acknowledge that dentists have withdrawn from the dtss dental treatment services scheme scheme however a substantial number of new contracts have also been agreed on that basis any overall reduction in the number of dentists operating under the dtss scheme has been relatively small
3772521 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3772522 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3772523 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3772524 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years
3772525 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
3772526 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3772527 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers
3772528 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island at the same time we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise it is a game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars r a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value
3772529 yes well do it till were 50 and hes dead and his son romeo mraz will be up on stage instead
3772530 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3772531 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3772532 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3772533 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3772534 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3772535 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3772536 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3772537 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3772538 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3772539 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3772540 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3772541 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3772542 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3772543 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3772544 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3772545 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3772546 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3772547 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3772548 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3772549 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3772550 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3772551 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3772552 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3772553 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3772554 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3772555 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3772556 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3772557 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3772559 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
3772560 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
3772561 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
3772562 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
3772563 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
3772564 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
3772565 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
3772566 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
3772567 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
3772568 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
3772569 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
3772570 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
3772571 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
3772572 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
3772573 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
3772574 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
3772575 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr

3772598 if the anti democratic individual is disposed to see in the outer world impulses which are suppressed in himself
3772599 and we to know what these impulses are then something may be learned by noting what attributes he most readily but unrealistically ascribes to the world around him it seemed that the greater a subjects preoccupation with evil forces in the world as shown by his readiness to think about and to believe in the existence of such phenomena as wild erotic excesses plots and conspiracies and danger from natural catastrophes the stronger would be his own unconscious urges of both sexuality and destructiveness
3772600 homosexuality is a particularly rotten form of delinquency and ought to be severely punished
3772601 no matter how they act on the surface men are interested in women for only one reason
3772602 the sexual orgies of the old greeks and romans are nursery school stuff compared to some of the goings on in this country today even in circles where people might least expect it
3772603 sex crimes such as rape and attacks on children deserve more than mere imprisonment such criminals ought to be publicly whipped
3772604 a strong inclination to punish violators of sex mores homosexuals sex offenders may be an expression of a general punitive attitude based on identification within group authorities
3772605 but it also suggests that the subjects own sexual desires are suppressed and in danger of getting out of hand
3772606 moralistic and punitive attitude toward the supposed sexuality of others
3772607 the authors investigated the role of homsexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals participants consisted of a group of homophobic men n 35 they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the index of homophobia w w hudson and w a ricketts 1980 the men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual male homosexual and lesbian videotapes only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies
3772608 violence anarchic impulses and chaotic destructiveness in the unconscious sphere the pseudo conservative is a man who in the name of upholding traditional american values and institutions and defending them against more or less fictitious dangers consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition
3772609 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3772610 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3772611 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3772612 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3772613 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3772614 what beliefs had to have been in place for me to create these circumstances
3772615 i always have plenty of money for everything i need money flows to me easily i make money in many different ways i love having plenty of money
3772616 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3772617 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3772618 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3772619 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3772620 i love you i just am not ready to love you lets hook back up in ten years when i am old and gray and have fulfilled all of my dreams without you by my side i dont really care that you love me and are willing to help me fulfill my dreams when i am old and need someone in my life then you can be a part not until then though ok
3772621 i love you i just am not ready to love you
3772622 you can try to be his friends as long as you are not his booty call or at his beckon call
3772623 i wish theyd just go away vanish never to return
3772624 there were a number of improvements that needed to be made to the treatment plant in order for this to happen
3772625 each water treatment plant operates differently depending on where the water is coming from taylor has good water there is not a lot of iron or magnesium which will make a plant go crazy
3772626 part of the reason for the new intake facility is so that we dont have to worry about changes in sediment when it floods and we dont have to worry about trees taking out the intake station
3772627 that 20 000 plats could equate to 60 000 or more people along that corridor
3772628 we felt that we really should have done this 10 years ago but we cant start it 10 years ago we can only start it today
3772629 from a purely planning perspective we are looking at the widest scenario but that is not to say that is what it will ultimately be in every area
3772630 right now it is a planning study until you get to the actual design once we get to a preferred alignment based on all the input and the constraints then you do a more detailed schematic at that point in time we would know more about what that footprint will look like
3772631 the point i made in commissioners court is that given the numbers im questioning the need for 400 feet of right of way
3772632 it may be less but im just saying they are going to need to justify it because obviously you can build six lanes in 200 feet of right of way
3772633 the positive side of buying right of way now is it will be way cheaper today than it will be in the future
3772634 the negative side of it is that if you say this is where our corridor is going and dont actually purchase that property then really youve harmed those property owners then they cant ever sell their property you cant do that to people
3772635 txdot should be out here designating and buying right of way and everything else
3772636 the county shouldnt have to do it but the county cant wait for txdot to get its business in order
3772637 this is not one of the projects they had planned but northern williamson county has been largely underestimated in terms of population growth
3772638 we live it and see it every day and that is why we took the lead on this so that we could do this study and identify where the road alignment needs to be in the future
3772639 we said in october when we had our first meeting that we would try to move forward with this as fast as we could because we realize that peoples lives are interrupted as a result of this study
3772640 we are not trying to drag this out in fact we have sped it up but this is the process we have to go through
3772641 we felt that we really should have done this 10 years ago but we cant start it 10 years ago we can only start it today
3772642 information developed during the course of the sh 29 corridor study
3772643 given the obvious risks and financial consequences of over predicting growth

3772646 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3772647 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3772654 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving obama campaign manager david plouffe wrote in a statement early this morning
3772655 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3772656 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3772657 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3772658 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3772659 here in beijing there have been a few who have requested that more people be admitted into what are known as the olympic common areas and the organizing committee has been working to find appropriate means of doing this which we welcome

3772664 for four years we knew we could probably get under 7 minutes
3772665 i could not believe how close to me those guys were
3772666 i was more or less trying to count my strokes hoping id be dead on at the turns
3772667 im disappointed because i know i can go faster but there was nothing i could do i handled it the best way i could
3772668 to be in the same group with the greatest olympians who ever lived to have the most golds in history is unbelievable
3772669 after the fly i was trying to focus but i just kept thinking wow the greatest olympian of all time thats a pretty cool title
3772670 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3772671 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3772672 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3772673 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3772674 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3772675 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3772676 we had a rough road trip and to come home and beat tampa bay was huge
3772677 we didnt hit the cover off the ball but we got what we needed
3772678 as soon as i saw it down i took off it just happened to be right at him
3772679 at that point my job is to try to get into a rundown so that bartlett can get to third base and i wasnt able to do that
3772680 the university of ulsters vision is to be the leading university for sport in ireland and we are well on our way
3772681 its reputation for excellence in sport and sport science has been enhanced by the success of our flagship ulster sports academy and in the designation of the high performance centre as a pre olympic training camp for london 2012
3772682 we in the ulster sports academy value partnerships such as this with lucozade sport and look forward to a productive relationship that is good for our students and for the promotion of sport at the heart of a healthy society
3772683 these facilities have been a huge benefit to me i have been receiving a lot of help from people who have been helping me work on my fitness strength and conditioning getting me in tip top shape for the games
3772684 with all these facilities the university has been a real help in getting me prepared for the games
3772685 the high performance centre is absolutely first class university of ulster jordanstown has now one of the best centres in ireland if not the uk
3772686 we are seeing a lot of local people coming through the centre and it is great that they can use the centre to improve at their chosen sport
3772687 if theres one thing that you leave here with today it should be this and ill start with a question to get to my point if you could pick 10 of one person in this room to own or go long for the next 30 years who would it be it wouldnt be the person with the highest iq it wouldnt be the star athlete you would look for certain other qualities and if you had to pick one person to short for the next 30 years who would it be now ask yourself why you have made those selections if youve considered these questions properly the person youve gone long is probably someone who is honest courageous and dependable the person youve shorted is probably someone who is egotistical and likes to take the credit the point is that success is mostly dependent upon elective qualities not anything with which you are born you can choose to be dependable or not and its not easy to change so choose correctly now bertrand russell once said the chains of habit are too light to be felt until theyre too heavy to be broken so ask yourself who do i want to be at theend of this process you should determine that the person you want to buy is yourself you all are holding winning tickets
3772688 anti social behaviour such as gangs gathering vandalism noise attacks on the emergency services and interpersonal and family conflict is a very real and difficult problem for belfast residents and one which is being addressed with initiatives such as the small grants scheme
3772689 activities and projects brought about as a result of the scheme have acted as a great diversionary tactic to get young people enjoying sport arts and drama encouraging them not to get caught up in anti social behaviour
3772690 its important to recognise the positive work thats going on in communities across the city to make people feel safer and to encourage young people to engage in positive activities and give them an alternative to becoming involved in anti social behaviour
3772691 uptake of these grants has been city wide with excellent proposals being submitted and im delighted to see so many people benefiting from this cash boost
3772692 the belfast community safety partnership has put together a booklet detailing the projects which have applied and qualified for an award from the small grants scheme up to february 2008
3772693 the booklet also provides information on what can be achieved with 1 000 for community groups yet to avail of the scheme as well as offering information on how communities can tackle the problems of anti social behaviour
3772694 we used the grants to buy our own drums as previously we relied on borrowing drums from the beat initiative belfast carnival and arts development group
3772695 weve always wanted our own drums and this grant allowed us to do that the young people absolutely love it as it means they can practice their drumming whenever they want
3772696 its a great way to keep them off the streets and away from trouble
3772697 theyve got so good at it that theyre able to give lessons to new members previously we had to rely on the beat initiative to come out and teach
3772698 heartbeats has drummed at many local festivals such as the mayors parade 2008 and this years st patricks day parade
3772699 it is a community safety project we are working with young people in the area who are engaged in interface violence we are currently on a residential in dublin and galway trying to give them a greater understanding of their own culture
3772700 the funding has most definitely helped us especially in terms of funding the residential
3772701 we have been able to bring them to croke park for gaelic and hurling matches which is a first for many of them
3772702 midnight street soccer is a way of distracting youths from the surrounding areas from taking part in anti social behaviour which is more likely to occur at that time of night
3772703 it takes place from 9pm to 12midnight each saturday involving 10 teams of 10 players along with spectators meaning around 120 people are involved altogether
3772704 the project is a great way of addressing the lack of youth provision in this part of south belfast the kids involved come from both sides of the community and find the project really meaningful
3772705 it costs between 3 000 3 500 to run the scheme for an eight week period so the funding given to us from the small grant scheme really goes a long way to help
3772706 this money went towards the higher force challenge which is a cross community project involving 12 young men aged 16 to 24
3772707 it is a cross community personal development programme which took place over six weeks
3772708 a key element to our programme is activity based and this money certainly helped us to achieve this
3772709 this money certainly made a difference especially when it came to working towards the duke or edinburgh award
3772710 the skills section involved several personal development sessions covering three key areas drugs awareness offending behaviour and healthy living issues
3772711 the service section involved several hill surveys focusing on colin glen divis mountain and the cave hill regions of the belfast hills
3772712 group responsibilities involved identifying and reporting incidents of damage to wild life habitat illegal dumping and burning etc e mailed reports with pictures were sent to belfast hills partnership
3772713 the activity section involved several outdoor activities amp events focusing on healthy life styles interests encouraging fitness and team work

3772716 we have a good team when its not playing like this
3772717 you go out there and play with showboating if we dont take care of these things were going to have a lot of problems
3772718 the last five minutes with the 50 60 000 chanting u s a it was quite a feeling about what it means to be in these tournaments
3772719 we were very close even when we play with 10 men we never give up
3772720 there was a big scene from the nigerian player but i dont know we didnt expect this kind of reaction its kind of unacceptable

3772723 a convoy of russian tanks left gori but is not heading to tbilisi
3772724 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3772725 unfortunately we are forced to restate the very fact that the principal agreement reached on the ceasefire and the return of the armed formations to the places of their permanent dislocation is being permanently violated by the russian federation
3772726 despite the assurances from the georgian side that they have ended all military activities russian troops shot down a second georgian drone over tskhinvali earlier today
3772727 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3772728 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3772729 truce was signed to withdraw russian troops and withdraw georgian troops what about the ossetian and abkazian separatists
3772730 it is a political document amp 183 it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3772731 i was trying to make a borat style documentary that pitted these actors against the pot masters of the universe
3772732 i wanted them to out ego the biggest egos in the world of cannabis
3772733 is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application
3772734 is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters
3772735 is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him
3772736 there are between 6 000 8 000 people in east belfast waiting on suitable housing and we are building 300 houses this year ill be lobbying margaret ritchie on the issue and have already raised it with some of her officials
3772737 there is also the need for small business incubation units for smaller enterprises some of the land could be used for that
3772738 i would hope the cleaners the administrative staff and all the local businesses employed at garnerville will be fairly treated for many it will be unlikely they will be able to travel to cookstown for their jobs i would hope the small businesses which supply garnerville would be given a shot at least at what is going to happen in the new college
3772739 we are absolutely delighted to receive this money it is really going to help us work with other groups throughout northern ireland
3772740 the fact is that young people are still taking their own lives and we need to help our community in developing awareness of the problem
3772741 when philip died i just felt there was no one to come and knock my door and tell me what was happening or how to deal with my grieving process
3772742 when i started talking to other families i found there were people who had lost a loved one through suicide 20 years before but had never spoken about it
3772743 a suicide is a totally different form of bereavement you are left with so many questions people left behind feel they are walking about with a huge question mark above their head why did the person take their life was it something they said there is a great sense of guilt
3772744 people can become depressed themselves and many families where there has been a suicide end up breaking up because everyone is blaming each other and a person who has lost a loved one is actually at a high risk of subsequently taking their own life
3772745 an organisation like ours can provide support and facilitate families so they can talk tell them its ok to have the sorts of emotions they will have
3772746 we help bring them through all that and out the other side
3772747 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years

3772749 this is striking at the heart of an already socially deprived community
3772750 the newtownards road area has been identified as the fifth most deprived area in northern ireland
3772751 what are they thinking when they are depriving an area such as this which needs this library needs the free access to computers and print resources
3772752 our usage hasnt gone down significantly we have a lot of children coming in to use the computers because they dont have one at home but it will be them that will lose out
3772753 weve got very good support from the local politicians and people who know of the closure i would appeal for people to lodge their objections to the closure on the belb website
3772754 we all recognise that there is a need to modernise library service provision but the local communitys needs must be fully considered as part of any planning process ballymacarrett library provides a valuable service in a deprived community
3772755 it is not just a book lending service but also acts as a focal point and offers vital social contact for older people
3772756 it is also an important resource for local schools working to improve literacy and encourage active life long independent learning
3772757 the aim is to provide a modern library service for the city delivered in purpose built libraries and we look forward to hearing the views of all stakeholders on how future library provision in the city will look
3772758 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto
3772759 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the uk to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3772760 government support for aircraft manufacturing can be expected to attract some international scrutiny
3772761 is subject to eu commission approvals under normal competition rules
3772762 he originally came into us because his owner had left him outside and barely fed him
3772763 we did get him a new home but it later transpired that he had cancer of the nose because of his prolonged exposure to the sun
3772764 because of this the new owner no longer wanted him and we have now taken him back in
3772765 he has a lovely friendly nature his coat is shiny and in good condition and he still looks very healthy obviously we would prefer that jasper spends whatever time he has left in a loving home than in a shed are you that special person that give this cute little fellow something to live for
3772766 she is about one year old and has just finished weaning her kittens she is very friendly and likes to give you kisses
3772767 being very greedy she will probably be glad to get away from her offspring now that they have reached re homing age as they were always stealing her food
3772768 es gab seit einiger zeit spannungen sie wollten eigentlich eine pause einlegen und hofften die trennung auf probe w rde sie st rker machen leider hat das nicht funktioniert
3772769 john entschied sich die sache zu beenden da er das gef hl hatte er ist einfach nicht bereit f r die art von bindung die jennifer verdient
3772770 imagine what this world would be like today with total american influence
3772771 i am here and you will listen to me because i have something to say
3772772 the returning wanderer turned up with immigration stamps from south africa swaziland mozambique new zealand australia singapore thailand cambodia vietnam china hong kong and laos
3772773 i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels
3772774 a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3772775 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3772776 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure
3772777 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3772778 this spring for the first time in my 28 years as a head coach i made the decision that we were going to hit our quarterbacks all spring
3772779 we were not going to wrap them in cellophane every scrimmage every full speed drill we were going to hit em because we didnt know who it was the starter this season and i said if one gets hurt he gets hurt but we got to find out who it is and we cant wait till we start playing to find out that somebody cant take a hit or they cant avoid the rush
3772780 i think the best thing is matt left us with a tremendous legacy we had a lot of guys who were in there with him and they developed such a healthy respect for him so he left us with a legacy of what it means to play and what it means to work hard
3772781 its a joke its a sham its a shame its a farce
3772782 this isnt an issue that is going to be solved in one afternoon because the governor wants to play to the media and certain members of the general assembly
3772783 its very sad that he doesnt take his job more seriously
3772784 i encourage everyone to run for public office its not the greatest experience in the world but you learn a lot about yourself im going to do the political thing my newspaper friends who write bad editorials will say look he did the right thing im doing the wrong thing
3772785 it aint pretty when its being made but at least it comes out with something that is a good result im pleased that the pay raise was rejected if there are certain folks who dont believe they voted the right way today theyll just have to deal with their own consciences when they go to bed tonight
3772786 hes a good sheep hes the best i ever had
3772787 you can tell it wasnt the first time she handled that lamb
3772788 that girl did an outstanding job pretty much fault free
3772789 i was born in the barn and i never left
3772790 hes kind of a loner but when its time to show he knows what to do
3772791 we have something like this come up and were always putting roadblocks in the way
3772792 its very difficult to grow when we put up these roadblocks the drainage problem should be the landowners responsibility
3772793 you may lose money now but gain it back many times over
3772794 beginning in late september consumers can go to www helpgrowyoursoup com click on the red barn icon and theyll be able to contribute a dollar on their behalf to that 250 000 contribution
3772795 they just started this morning and just look at it
3772796 this is our pilot program to be sure were doing it right
3772797 our big push as an association is the community involvement
3772798 once you muslims are done complaining whining and griping about our flag our pledge our christian beliefs or our way of life i highly encourage you to take advantage of one other great australian freedom the right to leave
3772799 maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves american citizens will find the backbone to start speaking and voicing the same truths if you agree please send this on
3772800 todays conversation is one that i didnt think i would have to give in this community
3772801 never have we had such an opinion expressed by an elected official
3772802 we the leaders of religious and faith based organizations stand together in speaking out against religious discrimination religious bigotry and religious intolerance we respect the rights of individuals and groups to express their views and beliefs however we expect elected officials to represent their entire constituency completely and fairly without any bias or discrimination
3772803 as a jew i condemn ruffs e mail containing anti muslim comments
3772804 my ancestors traveled from country to country to find land to own and businesses and of course the freedom of worship
3772805 we want to stress that even though we are practicing muslims we are still law abiding tax paying citizens we choose to live in this country grateful that the u s constitution allows us to practice our religion freely
3772806 if the general public supports this referendum it will come back to this board
3772807 the education of our children is key to our community and our nation
3772808 i hope it does pass but im not sure i will be able to endorse it
3772809 i can understand why the school districts are doing this
3772810 we shouldnt be voting on this we should be voting for new people in springfield
3772811 when we open another task force like this we are subjecting ourselves to whatever other crime they are doing
3772812 not everyone wants to stick his head in the sand the sheriffs department and states attorney would have been working with this individual
3772813 johns for more than 400 000 fitts 40 of manteno has been charged with wire fraud tax evasion obstruction of justice illegal structuring of financial transactions and making false statements to federal investigators
3772814 to indict the entire crime fighting community for what one bad person did is unfair
3772815 maybe we should just wait a bit and let the dust settle
3772816 volunteers go one on one sitting and eating and talking with the vets and helping them play games we will have set up
3772817 i dont care if you like chocolate youre too fat to pick your own ice cream
3772818 wow do you think im too fat to be self responsible for choosing my own foods
3772819 i do not have any pain or soreness in my knee
3772820 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3772821 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3772822 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3772823 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3772824 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year
3772825 a lot of people say this is gregs team i think were a great team and greg is just a great addition
3772826 if that flag really does represent turkish cypriots as claimed how is that the cyprus olympic team introduced by christofias does not even have one turkish cypriot on it he should explain why a single turkish cypriot is not taking part in the olympics
3772827 if that flag really does represent turkish cypriots as claimed how is that the cyprus olympic team introduced by christofias does not even have one turkish cypriot on it he should explain why a single turkish cypriot is not taking part in the olympics
3772828 they began as i tried to tell some of the teachers here through my interest in the early space program and also because of the guidance that my family gave but i can guarantee you that a lot of it was nurtured by the early teachers that i had
3772829 he and asyst have mutually agreed that he will remain with asyst as the companys chief financial officer
3772830 against the machine being human in the age of the electronic mob
3772831 what the internets creating is a new kind of hierarchy where the loudest and most aggressive voices drown out or bully into silence the most patient and reflective voices
3772832 i really believe if youre a newspaper online and you dont allow this youre not really online youve got to invest in this and really think about it and not just shut off the pipeline
3772833 we have a whole generation thats trained to expect to be able to voice their opinion not just to read the news but to talk about it or share it and that may be ugly or it may be really provocative but i want to hear it
3772834 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3772835 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3772836 the fcc is appalled by this treatment of an accredited journalists within half a mile of the main olympic stadium
3772837 i think you were saying something about paying more than 2000 for a vacuum cleaner
3772838 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
3772839 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3772840 the wounded were lying on the ground men in military uniforms
3772841 everybody knew him this was his place for 30 years
3772842 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3772843 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3772844 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3772845 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3772846 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3772847 once they did an action they never went back to that place
3772848 and the people involved in that action would never talk about it ever
3772849 they would pick their targets sometimes a year in advance and do significant surveillance getting the timing down of the guards if there are any if there are people there
3772850 their main thing was that they always claimed they didnt hurt anybody so they were very vigilant to make sure they watched a place so that nobody was in there
3772851 they would steal their clothes or get them out of goodwill secondhand type stores all black
3772852 theyd go in at night with police scanners and radios and then afterwards theyd get rid of their clothes even sometimes going as far as getting new tires for whatever vehicles they used
3772853 they have these small autonomous groups that dont know each other and they just go out and commit acts and usually the groups are four or five max
3772854 they dont use their real names they use made up nicknames codenames and thats the way they always refer to each other and they do that supposedly so when they get arrested even if they try to cooperate they cant
3772855 spain has a huge commune type area and so at least weve been told from the national police there it would be a good place for her to be if she was wanted anywhere in the world
3772856 shes a very good shoplifter which all these people were
3772857 thats how they got all their material to build these devices by shoplifting
3772858 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3772859 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3772860 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3772861 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3772862 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3772863 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3772864 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3772865 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3772866 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3772867 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3772868 swing vote saying that elements of the plot and marketing efforts were stolen from him
3772869 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3772870 by executive order i demand you tell me what youre doing
3772871 not never again but yes again and again and again
3772872 gods name is holy but no holier than yours to call upon his name is to call upon your own
3772873 the name of jesus christ as such is but a symbol it is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the many names of all the gods to which you pray
3772874 do not make the pathetic error of clinging to the old rugged cross
3772875 i dont think this is a good decision for the functioning of the justice system
3772876 not one of my adversaries wants justice they want a political condemnation in a political case against a political adversary
3772877 eh kita mah kalau mau lihat mobil letaknya di showroom bukan di pameran
3772878 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving obama campaign manager david plouffe wrote in a statement early this morning
3772879 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3772880 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3772881 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3772882 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3772883 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3772884 we have said that the sanctions should not be lifted without the return of all abductees and our stance will never change
3772885 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results
3772886 look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time make the right moves on the nuclear issue
3772887 this is an achievement thanks to fukudas talks oriented policies
3772888 we have to monitor details of their action and consider if it will lead to what people can accept
3772889 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3772890 i believe we need to create a special committee in the us senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3772891 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3772892 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3772893 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3772894 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3772895 with nature we have gone working against nature for too long
3772896 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them gm crops out of hand
3772897 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3772898 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3772899 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3772900 the impact it has had on the market is gigantic
3772901 like kate moss she has the innate fashion sense of being able to throw on whatever is lying next to the bed and looking fabulous
3772902 our pretty in pink character shes a smart girl from the other side of the tracks
3772903 promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken
3772904 in a whole range of african countries where there are factional fightings there are paramilitaries operating all over and serious violations of human rights by everybody the u n peacekeepers have also been tempted and fallen prey to this utterly unacceptable standard of behavior
3772905 i certainly can speak for the indian army with my just under 40 years in uniform
3772906 when you have such large numbers deployed in such circumstances not that im condoning it but theyre really aberrations one must take note of it and make sure that theyre severely dealt with
3772907 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3772908 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3772909 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3772910 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3772911 i fear that we are becoming a nation which simply sits in front of a television screen and orders its lives at the press of a button or mouse
3772912 the danger is in having all this wizardry in individual homes which people never leave and where there is as a result no social interaction
3772913 like all these developments there is that which has the potential for good and that which has the potential for evil there is in the internet the potential for destroying ourselves
3772914 he has pointed out the dangers of the internet just like there are great dangers in books and other communication mediums i think there is an even greater danger though in being afraid of it
3772915 just like the church is deeply involved in work in areas such as red light districts in towns and cities and working amongst the dregs of society we need to be involved in the internet and using our influence for the good
3772916 the chinese are keen to show they are in control they dont want to spoil the olympic party but there is no doubt this is a significant escalation
3772917 it is not just the quantity but the quality of the attacks that has changed they are becoming more dangerous
3772918 security should not become in any way a cover to try and deal with dissent
3772919 des documents techniques montrent que le constructeur fran ais a autoris pendant plus dun an que le travail de soudure soit r alis sans que les proc dures ne soient approuv es

3772928 i began to live a duel life by day i investigated the local dioceses dug up documents in courthouses talked with a seemingly endless string of victims and interviewed bishops their aides attorneys and priests in my off hours i put in my final months of training to become a catholic
3772929 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3772930 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3772931 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3772932 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone
3772933 what we want to do is make the experience of remembering as simple as possible
3772934 it got to the point that before i checked in i would ask them to remove the goodie box from my room
3772935 when we checked out we were told there were no charges so we had a zero balance
3772936 it took two days to get through to the accounts payable department
3772937 because of transitions in the company we dont have an appropriate spokesperson to speak on this topic right now
3772938 our hotels value their guests and we want to make sure guests are satisfied with all aspects of their stay
3772939 many properties charged for breakfast when it was included in the room rate
3772940 a call to the billing department got the charges reversed without a problem
3772941 the interesting part of this transaction was that because of the exchange rate i was credited more dollars than the original charge
3772942 you have the penguin tattoo crowd the normal girls a few of the housewife betty set everybody knows everybody
3772943 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3772944 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3772945 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3772946 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3772947 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3772948 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3772949 every time we got in the truck they were just cheering
3772950 based on our tracking record since christmas the numbers of those accessing the food bank and daily bread program many for the first time are up about 30 per cent last year we distributed school supplies to 110 families more than 300 students and we expect that to increase to about 145 families or between 300 and 400 children this year
3772951 this is a great program im always delighted to be able to help children
3772952 these are the kids of our future and giving them the tools they need at this time of their lives can mean success
3772953 this year were in dire need of backpacks for students to carry all their supplies and personal items plus their lunch
3772954 over the summer months our supplies get very low in the food bank
3772955 the purpose of this tour is to educate and raise awareness of the program and to make sure that everyone knows that one drop of oil can make a difference and how to properly and responsibly recycle their used oil and used containers and oil filters
3772956 a lot of people definitely want to recycle their oil and the containers and the filters and theres a lot of interest in it
3772957 and we have seen quite high numbers of recovery rates since the program started
3772958 primarily they are made up of local people who are known to be involved in the drug world
3772959 we do from time to time see others come in from outside areas but mostly the people we are seeing connected to that organization are local
3772960 they moved their upper echelons from community to community as needed or as police attention is drawn to them the lower tiers pretty much maintained their position in our community
3772961 to some degree it is abuse of power they have over these people
3772962 these persons would normally be marginalized people in regular society so by virtue of the drug trade they are in now they have power over a sector of people that normally they would not have power over
3772963 there are social agencies trying to get a handle on this and for the most part are doing a good job
3772964 but it is a difficult proposition because for some people the drug trade holds the allure of money and notoriety they would not normally get
3772965 tennis as a sport is fully committed to the fight against doping
3772966 should i question whether the action is one that i need to be doing at the moment generally when god is calling me to an activity even a challenging or unpleasant task there is more of a feeling of i am going to as opposed to i should

3772972 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homophobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
3772973 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
3772974 el aumento de la cifra de rescates de monta a y ha especificado que el municipio donde m s casos se registran es el de
3772975 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3772976 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3772977 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school

3772981 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me

3772992 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3772993 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value this will continue to be our emphasis as we enter the fall season

3773219 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
3773220 i dont think its coincidence that the last words god spoke to his people at the end of the old testament his last words for four hundred years were on the importance of fathering and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and strike the earth with a curse
3773221 i know of no man or woman regardless of age who doesnt still yearn for his or her fathers approval and love
3773222 fathers have an innate ability to influence their children and the community around them i call it father power in my workshops for men its not the physical power of being bigger and stronger than their wives and kids but the generational power with which god has endowed them the power that allows fathers to affect peoples lives positively or negatively for good or evil for hundreds of years
3773223 conversely men who father intentionally and put their childrens needs ahead of their own start a legacy that snowballs with positive ramifications down through the centuries
3773224 when fathers neglect this duty or are absent from the home families are attacked by predators families are like flocks of sheep children like lambs are na ve and simple in their understanding of the world fathers are like sheepdogs guarding the flock from marauding wolves we protect our families from human predators and from corrupt television programs movies music books friends and other people or influences that enter into a childs life
3773225 you are so important that you are nearly irreplaceable in the lives of your children especially your son fatherhood is a privilege given by god and with that privilege comes the power to impact lives

3773276 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
3773277 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3773278 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3773279 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california

3773289 c di vero che latalanta ha fatto unofferta allascoli che stata accettata per lofferta al giocatore molto pi bassa rispetto a quella di due mesi fa ovvero latalanta aveva formulato unofferta molto pi alta al calciatore quando non aveva ancora trovato laccordo con i marchigiani ora che le parti hanno trovato unintesa gli orobici hanno offerto un contratto che a noi non sta bene
3773290 stefano lanno scorso ha avuto unofferta importante dalla fiorentina ma lascoli non ha voluto accettare quindi ora prima di vincolarci vedremo un po di guardarci in giro
3773291 questa una cosa di due settimane fa mentre latalanta roba vecchia diciamo che quella frase era uscita dopo che gli orobici serano fatti da parte senza trovare laccordo con i bianconeri

3773299 today when the occupier is on our soil they think that tbilisi will be broken subdued and will surrender to their tanks as it had happened several times in the past in other european countries
3773300 it will not happen now and you are standing here with us and supporting us
3773301 i also understand the disappointment that many of our citizens feel at the lack of tangible support from the west that includes military support i know that many georgians expected the west would intervene
3773302 i think we should take this into consideration from now on any policy decision we make must be carefully thought through with a cool head only then will we be able to really achieve the georgian governments goals
3773303 we should never raise the expectations of the georgian people or our own expectations too high by thinking that the west is going to intervene militarily to resolve this conflict
3773304 i dont have a particularly good opinion about some high ranking individuals in the government and i doubt they really had envisaged things that were to come it seems like saakashvili at that moment was under others influence unfortunately
3773305 we in fact responded to south ossetia leader eduard kokoitys provocation whether kokoity was driven by stupidity or deviousness the fact remains that they attacked our positions and we responded
3773306 we were not able to contain ourselves and began the attack on tskhinvali which was a mistake of course
3773307 he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3773308 right up until the hours before georgia launched its attack late last week in south ossetia washingtons top envoy for the region assistant secretary of state daniel fried and other administration officials were warning the georgians not to allow the conflict to escalate

3773344 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff

3773364 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3773365 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3773366 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3773367 beginning right now you could begin pocketing hundreds of dollars in guaranteed commissions on any one of 3 500 publicly traded stocks

3773376 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages

3773388 for example bahrains telecommunications market is expected to transform the ict market into a us 375 billion industry by 2010 due to high demand for it products and services from both public and private sectors
3773389 this is because the customers will be studying the very same criteria on each prospective vendor
3773390 the middle eastern partners need to be able to source for local equipment suppliers which also have to have good after sales and local manpower support

3773537 our funding allows considerable flexibility and autonomy our expectations in return are that funding recipients should demonstrate an awareness of the wider context of their research and its societal and ethical implications beyond the usual research conduct considerations

3773669 in segmenting the mature market the focus should be more on the persons stage in life rather than on ones age life stages can be defined in terms of social psychological and health related circumstances that people face much of the research in social sciences shows that people age not just biologically or physically but also socially and even spiritually they age differently and at different rates it is often the composite of changes in these aging processes that affect behavior
3773670 market heterogeneity suggests that using one strategy for the entire market is not likely to be effective companies marketing to the mature population have the choice of going after select segments of this market or trying to appeal to all subsegments this decision can often be made by considering factors such as company resources and objectives
3773671 the smaller the differences the fewer the potential sales lost due to undifferentiated marketing the greater the differences the larger the losses conversely the greater the differences the higher the costs of developing marketing programs to meet different needs and therefore the incremental revenues needed to cover these costs
3773672 the reasons older consumers behave the way they do are several and no single theory or approach is likely to provide adequate explanations behavior is influenced by a host of factors and recent efforts in several disciplines of social sciences aimed at understanding human behavior have been focusing on incorporating several factors stemming from different research traditions
3773673 segmentation is still a viable strategic tool however the purpose here is to find out the needs and attitudes that are both common and different among younger and older people or among subsegments of the mature market in doing so the strategy can be developed on the basis of similarities avoiding products and communications that are likely to get different responses from the marketplace for example both younger and older consumers would like to see easier to open package according to results of many surveys and company efforts along this line would constitute an effective marketing tactic the focus should be on emphasizing commonalities and deemphasizing differences in attitudes and preferences of the market

3773677 the entrance of radtz in the animal feed industry is relatively easy since we will only need approval from the department of agriculture in china which is in contrast to entering the food industry where the process might take years
3773678 therefore our target market is chinas entire feed industry which is approximately rmb 274 2 billion 39 8 billion 1 rmb 0 145 in the next three years we hope radtz will capture 20 of the animal feed market

3773723 we have got here and everyone says its a bonus
3773724 if i can make a comparison its like getting to the semi final against aberdeen and people said make that your day
3773725 people are saying the exact same thing now you have got here you are playing nordsjaelland danish super league enjoy your day
3773726 we are certainly not preparing that way we are preparing to keep it tight here and hopefully have something to go out and play for in denmark
3773727 the boys are probably that bit more experienced and they are used to it
3773728 so thats been beneficial certainly before the final they were high as kites and before the semi final
3773729 i feel they are a bit more settled now they know what to expect the expectation levels have risen and we have got to make sure we dont fall short
3773730 its difficult to compare but i would say they are certainly a premier league standard i would say a top six premier league side
3773731 they have signed a couple of boys for over a million pounds i think that says they are going to be quality opposition and we have to to make sure we are well organised and dont let them play too much
3773732 the final we lost 3 2 and the semi final we won 4 3 it shows on a one off game we can compete
3773733 we have come forward quite a lot but we have got to make sure we defend tighter than we have been doing

3773741 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3773742 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3773743 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3773744 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3773746 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3773747 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3773748 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3773749 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3773750 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3773751 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3773752 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3773771 a bush that is a republican administration would have another advantage over gore it would not be burdened with the pro israel bias of the democratic party due at least in part to its heavy jewish influence

3773881 although set on the eastern seaboard the story it tells as its narrator himself observes is really about the west but that admission is not the primary reason for scott fitzgeralds novel to be invited into the western hall of fame no it has more to do with the metamorphosis of jimmy gatz into jay gatsby the process begins in childhood evidenced by a ragged old copy of a book called hopalong cassidy into which gatsby to be had inscribed a strict daily timetable and a list of general resolves and concludes when he meets a mentor surnamed cody the name of course is a signal it broadcasts that jay gatsby reborn is a part of that line of self made westerners that begins with the scout whose exploits reenacted thrilled the crowned heads of europe none other than buffalo bill cody on top of all that is the fact that the book concludes with the necessary shoot out

3774031 both emerging and development markets are down with china and india having dropped the most developed countries by relatively less and commodity exporting countries like south africa brazil russia and soudi arabia the least
3774032 having lost one fifth to one third of their value equity assets would appear to have greater upside rather than down side prospects if there are no major further shocks a slow albeit hesitant recovery may be envisaged
3774033 besides the fact that world economies can offset the disturbance in the financial sector of the developed country can contribute to an improvement in the behaviour of equity markets in early 2009

3774042 theres a lot of people on our team who arent happy with our class choices
3774043 but after weve established diablo iii as its own game with its own type of gameplay and experiences i wouldnt be opposed to looking at old classes we are trying to design the witch doctor class so that if we did bring back the necromancer theres room for him were looking out ahead of time at what our expansions are going to be so weve got to keep room open for some of those other classes down the road

3774385 uninsured and medicaid patients access to preventive care comparison of health centers and other primary care providers
3774386 the findings document that while health centers serve the most vulnerable populations at the greatest risk for poor health outcomes their patients are getting more preventive care
3774387 this underscores the value of health centers in serving hard to reach populations and the importance of continued investment in health centers as the core of the safety net
3774388 this study has important implications for national health reform because it underscores that even comparably insured patients may have distinctly different health care access patterns with the highest need patients significantly more likely to be treated in health center and other safety net settings
3774389 the care should include prevention early intervention targeted treatments for particular disorders an understanding of developmental processes and continuity of care
3774390 furthermore treatments should be accessible regardless of age gender sexual orientation disability race ethnicity and culture lastly evidence based practice should be cross disciplinary and include collaborations with families schools practitioners and researchers from various health fields

3774442 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then member of parliament for central fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3774443 a very popular diligent local member of parliament he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played
3774444 in fife he pioneered free travel for the elderly led scotland and britain with nursery education for three and four year olds was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at rosyth naval base and was well known for his support for all local causes
3774445 over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
3774446 our heartfelt condolences go to his widow cathy to his son and daughter scott and julie and to his mother and sister
3774447 john was a kind and decent man who was dedicated to the service of the people of fife with distinguished service both in parliament and local government
3774448 i have greatly admired the way in which he has borne such a debilitating illness with enormous courage my thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time
3774449 john macdougall was totally loyal to the labour party he served so well and i greatly valued his support
3774450 a proud fifer he was well respected by party colleagues constituents and trade unionists we will all miss his outstanding contribution our thoughts are with his family
3774451 i was very sad to hear of the death of john macdougall and my thoughts are with his wife cathy and children julie and scott at this difficult time
3774452 john was an excellent member of parliament and will be sadly missed by colleagues of all parties
3774453 he was a doughty fighter for the people of fife over many years as a trade unionist long standing councillor and dedicated member of parliament
3774454 both as a councillor and as a member of parliament john macdougall embodied the best traditions of public service
3774455 his courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
3774456 john was somebody who was committed to the people of fife who spent many years in public service
3774457 were all devastated by this really sad news to me john was first and foremost a family man and i think our heartfelt condolences must go to cathy and his family

3774465 a new computer game tipped to be the most violent ever is being released exclusively on the so called family friendly wii console
3774466 parents horrified as most violent video game ever to launch on family friendly wii
3774467 the decision to release a violent game on a console which has based its reputation on family fun has shocked anti violence pressure groups
3774468 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3774469 i can confirm that the remarks attributed to me in the daily mail online are accurate thank you for asking
3774470 i believe it madworld will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3774471 often times brutality is expressed in a spiteful nature there are already plenty of games out there that hit this mark however we decided that
3774472 to give you an example from gameplay we have a scene where you can pull a street sign from the ground and shove it into a enemys head however i thought that it is much more fun to stab someone with a sign that actually has some sort of meaning as opposed to a knife we tried the idea out and the reaction amongst the team was so positive i knew this was the way to proceed
3774473 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
3774474 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
3774475 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
3774476 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3774477 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
3774478 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3774479 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be

3774486 we kind of take that with a little bit of pride
3774487 some people are nice but a lot of times its like what was it like to lose to lsu or florida
3774488 we have i think 40 guys on our rosters right now that are entering years four or five and theres a little challenge there in our eyes to make sure that those guys come back into training camp and they dont think its same old same old
3774489 weve got a lot of guys who have seen a preseason poll come up while theyve been here and seen that it hasnt always been accurate so maybe that will be a good reminder for us
3774490 the reds say they want to build a winner and are willing to put the money into the team then they trade away dunn for what a single a pitcher coming off tommy john surgery and two players to be named
3774491 they better take the money they would have had to pay dunn next season and get some established players from the coming free agent pool if they dont i can see a lot of people finding something else to do next summer instead of spending their hard earned money at great american ball park
3774492 the first images are clearly littered completely with blocks of ice not surprising given that we saw such things in our first very high res four metre pixel resolution images taken back in 2005 and not surprising for a very fractured environment
3774493 now we have to figure out if we indeed have captured the sites where the jets are emerging so there s a lot more to do
3774494 canada is at war and any databases is critical to the performance of the canadian forces
3774495 i fail to see why they would not as a minimum suspend them from active duty and allow a court of law to get to the bottom of it
3774496 in my 16 years i havent seen ducks dying like this
3774497 it is upsetting when you see them sick you kind of feel for any wildlife thats hurting i mean you have to do the best you can for them
3774498 pure coincidence but there was a stack of color action photos of dunn on bruces shelf and that was no coincidence
3774499 he gave em to me and i just decided to bring em
3774500 im absolutely going to miss dunn even more so than ken griffey we had a relationship before i got to the big leagues working out together in texas during the offseason and he worked his tail off
3774501 were still going to be friends but this place is a lot different now
3774502 were moving forward and we have to accept it for what it is and the way it is you cant give up just because people are gone you have to move forward nothing stops for anyone in this game the show must go on
3774503 what we have now are three center fielders jay bruce in right corey patterson in center and rookie call up chris dickerson in left
3774504 and hes better than last year and thats exactly what i like to see a guy improve
3774505 right into the fire tonight getting called up i expected it
3774506 i played center most of the time but the past couple of years they emphasized me moving around i played left a lot when jay bruce was at louisville and he played center we rotated and got our fair share of experience
3774507 they arent meeting me half way im going 80 and shes only going 20
3774508 dunner made it clear to some of us in the clubhouse that his asking price is 120 million to 125 million
3774509 thats it theyre saying they are not going to build a strong team here
3774510 if they keep the pitchers they have now well be all right i think theyll go out and sign some hitters if we didnt have a veteran manager like dusty baker i might be concerned but im not
3774511 felt like a whirlwind for the first couple of innings
3774512 i was almost relieved with the five pitch walk to start the game then i stole a base and that relieved the pressure
3774513 and it was like a thousand pounds came off my chest
3774514 it was an exciting first couple of innings especially with those balls in left field
3774515 best play i ever made in the big leagues yes
3774516 the way weve been playing i was not going to let that ball get past me i was going to do everything possible to stop it
3774517 we played a good game tonight offensively and defensively edinson threw a great game and thats where it starts it got hairy in the seventh but javy made a great play down there
3774518 that one play won the game plus he hit a home run off me on a pitch i placed perfectly down where the catcher wanted it and he whacked it
3774519 he was throwing strikes but he was a little bit more wilder than he was the last two times when he didnt pitch as well
3774520 he threw a lot of strikes the last two performances so maybe he needs to be just a little wild
3774521 may be if i have a game like that ill be happy to be a little wild
3774522 he was cheering me up more than i was able to cheer him up
3774523 hes a tough dude because i wouldve passed out woke up and passed out again probably a couple more times
3774524 kids are kids and you look at kids and they take their shoes off and run around all the time
3774525 when your feet hurt you want to take your shoes off maybe his feet were hurting that day so maybe he wanted to take his shoes off
3774526 in this league guys are up and down every week
3774527 i thought i was up because when i started moving the crowd started yelling and got happy i went in the corner and i asked the coach what the score was and he said i lost by one point that really upset me
3774528 its hard just thinking about every day every week every month the years that ive been working so hard for this and i came this far to lose in the first round again
3774529 i listen to just two people my mom and my coach
3774530 we were screaming to him to throw punches he said he heard someone saying for him to move he was looking up in the stands
3774531 he did what we would hope other young boxers would do
3774532 he stayed around four more years and he worked so hard for him to lose could be disheartening for some other guys thats our biggest fear
3774533 and the way the scoring went i definitely think our other guys are gonna be psyched out weve got a psychologist around and were gonna make sure she talks to the team
3774534 this is some real bull and i want you to make sure you print the cuss words
3774535 he got robbed these kids train hard and then come here their careers and lives get destroyed

3774546 tonight i had an epiphany quite to the contrary of what i previously thought i am a complete media pig it started at 7 p m or so when i went out for a slightly romantic dinner with my wife i walked out of my house talking on my cell phone got the mail from my mailbox jumped into the car switched on the radio changed over to the cd player then moved on to a mp3 cd before switching to my wifes ipod i popped open my laptop my wife is the driver in my family opened excel to check my personal to do list which im way behind on popped in my mobile broadband card to get online checked my email checked the weather checked cnn com and bought some tickets for an event this weekend i then plugged my gps into my computer i love to watch how fast my wife is driving without getting yelled at for looking at the speedometer next i took a call on my cell and then made another call my wife asked me to check if her cousin had emailed her back which i did and then said i should check out the video of the 44 pound cat found in southern jersey strangely said cat doesnt look nearly as fat as i expected the internet signal crapped out so i quickly went through my snail mail and began reading an article in a small freebie newspaper i then flipped through two magazines and a catalog of aquarium supplies no i do not have an aquarium but aquarium supplies are very alluring to me for some reason i opened a demo video i had started creating and did a minute or two of editing the internet came back up and i googled musikfest an annual music festival as we had passed a billboard for it since we were nearly at the restaurant i opened ichat an instant messaging program and changed my status message as i will not be in the office tomorrow then i quickly sent myself a test email to make sure my out of office reply was working properly we jumped out of the car and walked toward the restaurant i checked my cell phone as i was expecting a picture of my young niece my wife called her offices answering service on her cell we walked into the restaurant and as you would expect we were exposed to environmental audio the restaurant has a computer reservation system so i suppose i was also exposed to computing software other because i was watching the screen while the hostess was having a difficult time finding my name sitting down and enjoying our meal involved very little media exposure though i did check my phone several times and text messaged my sister asking her where the picture was my wife used both her palm pilot and ipod to check out her calendar and jot down a few notes the car ride home was the same as the car ride there radio internet ipod etc my wife asked me to buy a song on itunes before she forgot and i did as instructed and then downloaded it to her ipod we arrived home and my epiphany occurred within 15 minutes as i was squeezing out of the car with my laptop cell phone mobile broadband card ipod newspaper magazines and doggie bagged desserts my landline began ringing inside the media related devices i was carrying were hindering me from getting inside fast enough to get the landline but i picked it up just in time before the answering machine kicked in while on the landline i checked my email checked the weather i am paranoid about the weather and searched for and printed out driving directions for tomorrow in case my gps craps out i settled in chatting on the phone and sitting on the couch half watching some live tv news until my wife grabbed the remote and changed the channel did some channel surfing scrolled through the program guide and finally settled on a tivoed show by that point i was off the phone had re checked my cell again for the elusive picture of my niece and was back on my laptop i suddenly realized i am more media than i am human its almost scary

3774560 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3774561 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3774589 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3774590 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3774591 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3774592 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3774593 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3774594 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3774595 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3774596 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3774597 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3774598 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3774599 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3774600 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3774601 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3774602 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3774603 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3774604 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3774605 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3774606 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3774607 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3774608 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3774609 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3774610 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3774611 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3774612 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3774613 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3774614 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3774615 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3774616 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3774617 who are open to doing something on the production side
3774618 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3774619 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3774620 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3774621 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3774622 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3774623 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3774624 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3774625 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3774626 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3774627 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3774628 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3774630 im ready to get it solved and move on the longer i stay here the worse its going to get
3774631 its frustrating to sit to the side i tweaked a little hamstring its nothing major i know i can still play and im ready to go its just frustrating sitting out here and dealing with this
3774632 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3774633 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3774634 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3774635 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3774636 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3774637 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3774638 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3774639 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3774640 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3774641 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3774642 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3774643 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3774644 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3774645 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3774646 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3774647 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3774648 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3774649 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3774650 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3774651 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3774652 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3774653 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3774654 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3774655 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3774656 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3774657 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3774658 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3774659 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3774660 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3774661 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3774662 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3774663 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3774664 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3774665 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3774666 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3774667 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3774668 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3774669 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3774670 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3774671 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3774754 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3774755 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3774756 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3774757 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3774758 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3774759 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3774786 uninsured and medicaid patients access to preventive care comparison of health centers and other primary care providers
3774787 the findings document that while health centers serve the most vulnerable populations at the greatest risk for poor health outcomes their patients are getting more preventive care
3774788 this underscores the value of health centers in serving hard to reach populations and the importance of continued investment in health centers as the core of the safety net
3774789 this study has important implications for national health reform because it underscores that even comparably insured patients may have distinctly different health care access patterns with the highest need patients significantly more likely to be treated in health center and other safety net settings

3774964 its somewhat surprising to me that more attention isnt being paid to succession planning issues
3774965 having the right people prepared to fill key positions is an essential business strategy in this time of fierce competition for talent the defining moments in a companys ability to stay competitive may rest in the focus it places on filling key positions with assimilated and capable replacements
3774966 i have held executive level hr positions with several large companies and the importance placed on succession planning was extremely high
3774967 it just makes sense the future successful management of the company depends on the strategic initiative it places on having an integrated succession plan specifically one that is consistently reviewed and used to fill key positions within the company
3774968 do you realise that every blade of grass is a different shade of green
3774969 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
3774970 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
3774971 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive

3774992 he was dipping in and out of consciousness and said he had a pain in his chest it took 20 to 25 minutes to get him out and there was no sign of life we gave him cpr but he was declared dead he didnt say how the accident happened just that he was in pain

3775001 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3775002 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3775003 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3775004 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3775005 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3775006 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3775007 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3775008 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3775009 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat

3775017 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3775018 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3775019 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3775020 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3775021 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3775022 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama

3775026 the eu cannot accept such developments in neighboring countries and it must not look on without doing something it must make a clear statement addressed to russia and in a second step it must think about what contribution the eu could make towards securing the peacefire in georgia its doubtful whether the eu will be able to reach a consensus on this but if the required unified action were again to fall victim to the strategic interests of individual eu members that would be a further victory for moscow
3775027 the battle for a wretched mountain region in the caucasus has created a new world order after deluding itself for too long the west now rapidly needs to find a convincing stance for dealing with a resurgent russia that no longer just rattles its sabre but makes use of it as well
3775028 the west must find a clear language for addressing moscow after hesitating for days george w bush found strong words and branded the russian attack on a sovereign neighboring state as unacceptable in the 21st century but the admonition of the outgoing american president wont have much impact in moscow firstly the russian leadership doesnt see itself as morally accountable to the iraq warrior bush secondly its waiting to see who will be moving into the white house republican hawk john mccain who wants to throw russia out of the g8 group of leading industrial nations or the young democrat barack obama who has made more moderate noises
3775029 theres a big risk that unclear signals may be misunderstood by moscow in this situation
3775030 the world and that means not just the west has a choice either it keeps on knuckling under to putin by just tut tutting and doing nothing if it does it will have to live with the consequences of putins imperialism or it shows him a clear stop sign and forces him and his so called peacekeepers out of georgia so that an international peacekeeping force can be stationed in abkhazia and south ossetia travel restrictions economic sanctions or frozen russian bank accounts abroad are measures that could hit russias economy hard
3775031 how can i do better now and in the future
3775032 forbidden fruit we have forbidden fruit hey eve we have forbidden fruit
3775033 a good first step toward getting ideas in place to take us where we want to go
3775034 everyone had to take time away from work and from their busy schedules to give of themselves for this and it was so wonderful of them to do it we really should celebrate a community that is so giving
3775035 my father plays the guitar when he would strum the guitar i would kick ive responded to music as long as ive been a being

3775037 were targeting sales of 100 000 units of this new vehicle in north america
3775038 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3775039 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3775040 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3775041 any kind of settlement it sends a message i think this resolution achieved what she wanted what she needed and did so more rapidly than waiting for trial
3775042 i think they referred to it as a cooling off period although shes been away for a year teaching swimming in the middle east i dont think they know she got another position to teach swimming in venezuela for another academic year
3775043 we had a policy more than three or four years ago that wasnt managed in our view in the way wed do it in the future our current policy appears to be a very workable one
3775044 we have a reasonable environment for all our patrons and try to accommodate them but just like if someone at the mall doesnt like the music on the pa it wouldnt be turned off for everybody our policy reflects good common sense
3775045 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3775046 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3775047 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3775048 theyre making a memory this morning that will last forever its just so exciting
3775049 i never wanted to go to a different school i have really good friends here
3775050 when youre here everybody embraces you i wouldnt want to spend my senior year anywhere else
3775051 its really fun because we get to set all the traditions and stuff
3775052 we just got a bunch of girls together and formed a team
3775053 we felt like instead of trying to add all four grades at once if we developed them one year at a time we could develop a higher quality program
3775054 we developed a whole plan there was a committee that was put together a year before we began the high school that really began in depth developing
3775055 adding the high school allowed us to provide a distinctively christian education that met the needs of christian families
3775056 were able to provide a solid christian education for students all the way from kindergarten through 12th grade
3775057 our high school kids serve as mentors and peer tutors for our younger students
3775058 i hope if the kids in the lower grades do decide to model after me theyll see my good days they wont see me when im cranky and tired
3775059 it takes a little while for that to become the mindset because for so many years we ended in 8th grade so it was typical for students to already have a plan to go to another high school
3775060 it sort of feels like every other year but i have a feeling that this will mean a lot more a decade down the line
3775061 i will be a part of the history of the school without even trying
3775062 mina hamiltons parents want her dead or undead to be precise theyre vampires and like it or not mina must decide whether to become a vampire herself but minas more interested in hanging out with best friend serena and trying to catch the eye of the too hot for high school nathan able than in the vampire training classes shes being forced to take hows a girl supposed to find the perfect prom date and pass third year french when her mom and dad are breathing down her neck literally
3775063 pay raises depend on how well employees do their jobs
3775064 military members who focus solely on cash compensation will tend to systematically undervalue the compensation package they receive
3775065 the view that exceptional costs generated by 1 percent of participants should be viewed as inconsequential if they can be charged off to 100 percent of plan participants is troubling
3775066 can be very high depending on how funds are invested on a particular day
3775067 i dont understand your rationale in penalizing those of us who act aggressively in the management of our fund
3775068 provided a real steady hand for all the blocking and tackling thats necessary for all the challenges of management of human capital at opm
3775069 while we have not always agreed with ms springers initiatives we did see more willingness to engage employee representatives under her tenure
3775070 i think from a people standpoint its reconnecting all the opm associates around the country to the washington office the directors office really needed to make the effort to physically get out to visit people listen to them find ways for them on a routine basis to give their input and be heard and responded to it had really become fragmented in my judgment in the human capital surveys the best places to work surveys opm had slipped now were having a resurgence and were really one agency again
3775071 we are pleased to report the majority of cases that processed to date under retireez matched the legacy calculation

3775077 i am disappointed that the irs does not notify a taxpayer when someone else has filed a return using the victims social security number
3775078 processes and procedures have been inadequate in reducing the burden for taxpayers who have been victimized when the irs becomes aware of employment related identity theft it does not take action unless the case relates to a substantive tax or conspiracy violation
3775079 there is no deterrent to keep the problem from spreading
3775080 has distracted the workforce from its primary mission as they continually struggle with its burdensome administrative and testing requirements
3775081 they carry an extra pair of trousers or a longer skirt in their handbags then they change into it in the mornings

3775086 many of you told us that january 2009 was too soon
3775087 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3775088 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3775089 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3775090 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3775091 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3775092 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3775093 i have never texted or e mailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3775094 ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics

3775097 it wasnt working out adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3775098 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3775099 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3775100 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and he said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
3775101 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3775102 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3775103 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3775104 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3775105 i see him all the time at least once a week

3775109 were only on the edge of what weve done to these people we have ripped away everything language culture land self esteem
3775110 you name any of the things that make you a human being and they have all been stripped away
3775111 in my worst moments i think that we might be way too late
3775112 they have been jerked from pillar to post theyve ended up in one concentration camp after another
3775113 it probably means annihilation of black communities but there are some people who will say to you that they are pretty well annihilated already
3775114 we amp squo re only on the edge of what we amp squo ve done to these people we have ripped away everything language culture land self esteem

3775117 im devastated about this especially for our dancers for whom it was going to be the highlight of the year
3775118 but i dont hold out much hope of that happening
3775119 we dont want to cancel on them at the last minute
3775120 we really dont want to cancel this but our backs are right up against the wall when it comes to raising more money
3775121 travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow mindedness and many of our people need it sorely broad wholesome charitable views can not be acquired by vegetating in ones little corner of earth
3775122 shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians who defend the abortion regime of roe v wade
3775123 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply say no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
3775124 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us what candidate or political party can withstand the loss of millions of catholic voters in this election or the next
3775125 catholic voters have the power to transform our politics and if faithful citizens can build a new politics a politics that is not satisfied with the status quo but one that is dedicated to building up a new culture of life
3775126 there are more than 150 million catholics in north america and if we stand together and demand better from our politicians we can transform politics and if we truly hope for a culture of life and a civilization of love then we must first think and then act in new ways
3775127 we have not opened our doors so we are not confirming any time line or location
3775128 until we are prepared to open our doors that wont be happening
3775129 we have to continue to educate the community about planned parenthood who they are what they are and what their agenda is
3775130 they have an agenda to target children to have them have sex as early as they can get them to
3775131 there are facilities in dubuque that perform the same services planned parenthood does
3775132 if the planned parenthood in dubuque will not perform surgical abortions then they will refer you to one of their facilities that will perform surgical abortions
3775133 or they will provide the means to perform medical abortions
3775134 this is the second time that planned parenthood has tried to move a facility into dubuque the first attempt was in 1990 when it announced that by january 1992 planned parenthood would be moving into dubuque and opening a facility that would not be committing abortions
3775135 however the pro life movement sought to stop planned parenthood and held a protect our city from planned parenthood prayer rally at louis murphy park
3775136 brody and many others believe that the real reason was because of overwhelming opposition and they are ready to rally opposition again if planned parenthood continues with its plans to move into their community
3775137 when you look at his opposition to the born alive infants protection act in illinois and the partial birth abortion ban which many mass attending catholics view as bans on infanticide obamas more extreme than any other democratic presidential candidate
3775138 if the boxer amendment which sen casey regrettably supported was enacted it would force the removal of family planning funds from private organizations that stick to non abortive methods in order to give those funds to organizations that are committed to the promotion of abortion
3775139 i have spoken clearly and candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
3775140 i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
3775141 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
3775142 trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3775143 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
3775144 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow america and our partners are realistic and were prepared for any possibility im optimistic about chinas future
3775145 even a 20 week foetus is likely to feel pain and excruciating pain
3775146 this is because pain transmission pathways have developed in the foetus but not the pain modulation pathways that are not effective until six weeks after birth
3775147 there is more than enough evidence now but no one is as blind as someone who doesnt want to see
3775148 at 20 weeks the physical apparatus for pain signal transmission is in place
3775149 it is still unclear whether a foetus interprets a sensation as unpleasant
3775150 the committee has shown us zero empirical evidence to back up its flimsy claim
3775151 if sen coburn can only deliver babies for free at a public hospital shouldnt sen leahy only be allowed to donate his notable thespian skills to a public entity like pbs
3775152 the parents of babies dr coburn delivers dont choose him hoping to sway his vote and they never have

3775158 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
3775159 this is a good step if it brings the national park service to where they need to be to reopen the crown but if its just another bureaucratic barrier then its not worth the paper its written on

3775167 not even a leaky pair of goggles could stop the phelps crunch on wednesday morning and a leaky pair of goggles is the height of irritation for a swimmer
3775168 yeah he could just swim the 200 butterfly faster than anyone ever has before he broke his own world record by six one hundredths of a second broke it while swimming with a dixie cup full of water sloshing against each eye guessing where the walls were on the turns
3775169 we were looking for an amazingly fast swim the way hed swam in prelims and semifinals at least a second better than that
3775170 phelps was visibly angry with his lousy world record when he got out of the pool an hour later he was back in the water and ready to take out his aggravation in the 800 freestyle relay he swam the fastest lead leg ever in that event threatening the 200 free world record he set a day earlier and helping the americans smash the world mark by nearly five seconds

3775172 the high bidder for almost 5 000 acres of public service board land in northeast el paso is hunt communities the successful bid comes after an unprecedented process that will provide almost a generations worth of land north of fort bliss to a single purchaser
3775173 hunt issued a statement early thursday along with a letter notifying the psb of its decision to withdraw its bid which at more than 27 000 per acre was well ahead of the rival bidder reaction from the city was swift beyond the finger pointing are questions of development quality quantity and need
3775174 a story from the archives this one dated nov 27 2006 sheds some light on the context of northeast land development that has been highlighted by the recent withdrawal by hunt communities of its 131 million bid for psb land of particular interest are comments regarding subdivision codes enjoy

3775222 i wrote the book mind juice when i was young homeless and going through many tough times
3775223 the poems were originally written on old sheets of paper and napkins which i hung on to for many years reading my own words during that period of my life often helped me envision a better future for the world and myself it is extremely exciting to bring these poems to life with bruno linares brilliant musical accompaniment
3775224 i love giving and sharing my art and am very fortunate to own the company jimmyland corporation j music group that publishes all of my books and music
3775225 it is truly gratifying and an honor to be able to donate thousands of books and cds with music throughout the world helping to instill a message of hope to those who are in need
3775226 the most exciting aspect about the web for businesses is the emergence of social networking
3775227 social networking services like facebook or myspace have created powerful new ways to communicate and share information but no one has yet applied this powerful application to community management this is groundbreaking and instrumental towards guiding the industry in a positive direction
3775228 in my personal experience the most difficult challenge starting out in the industry was the lack of guidance mentorship and training for dealing with day to day assignments thats what we want to provide through my condo coach support consulting collaboration training and mentoring for newly licensed and established managers or for board members simply grasping to figure out how to oversee the management of their association
3775229 its a great thing to be able to act as a team and join forces with colleagues to discuss the real day to day problems and solutions we encounter there really is no comparable resource in the industry and lcams with such a resource are going to be at a real competitive advantage

3775235 communism destroyed the not just the social class or social classes but it destroyed the creative energies of an entire people it drove them underground it brutalized them it destroyed them to the point where they could not produce the same titanic figures that had just come onto the world stage before the advent of communism
3775236 i still remember the russian tanks rolling down the streets of budapest
3775237 enough is enough and we want to get out of the soviet camp we want to be democratic we want to be part of the free world
3775238 it recognizes that these individuals along with their employers and educators have made significant investments into the canadian workforce and the canadian economy we dont want to lose those investments so the new cec encourages them to stay and makes the process easier
3775239 though this represents a positive shift in canadian immigration we would have hoped that the number of applicants coming in under the cec would have added to the overall immigration targets for 2008 rather than included in this number
3775240 by not expanding immigration levels successful cec applicants will take the place of qualified individuals who applied from abroad and who have been waiting patiently
3775241 we realized that amidst the gossip out there there were these little nuggets of inspirational gold that nobody was picking up and celebrating
3775242 we decided to change that with an online vehicle specifically designed to cover that scene
3775243 we didnt expect anything like this when we started ecorazzi it was supposed to be just a small little project from a couple of green bloggers who had never met each other
3775244 in fact a true virtual endeavor we didnt even meet face to face until eight months later
3775245 we decided early on that the need existed to not only cover the environmental passions of those in the spotlight but also the other important philanthropic efforts underway good deeds and acts of charity occur in the entertainment industry all the time we thought it was time to create a site that truly addressed these initiatives on a day to day basis
3775246 one of our favourites so far has been the campaign to bring back the a team the exceptionally popular television series from the 80s that still seems to make appearances on our screens with mr t featuring in the most recent snickers advert

3775248 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3775249 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3775250 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3775251 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3775252 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
3775253 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

3775259 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
3775260 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
3775261 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
3775262 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
3775263 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3775264 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3775265 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
3775266 muqtadas people were taking over the city and a lot of my brothers friends joined the mahdi army
3775267 i told him stay away from these people but apparently they generated so much pressure on him they convinced him to go out and fight
3775268 and these guys know when a drone comes its either going to fire or its going to take pictures so they ran haji wanted to prove hes not afraid he stood there then a missile strikes and shrapnel runs straight to his heart and kills him on the spot
3775269 the same technology you use to send a missile to destroy a village

3775273 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
3775274 i am becoming increasingly concerned about the penchant for mayor eddie francis to conceal information from windsor city council read todays windsor star editorial entitled tunnel talks taxpayers deserve full story my bone of contention involves the mayors july 29th press conference in which he released pretty pictures from a toronto consulting firm brook mcilroy on a proposed canal marina on the city centre west lands it turns out these buck rogers cartoonish drawings cost windsor taxpayers 10 000 and were commissioned without councils approval or knowledge on may 20 by cao john skorobohacz under delegation of authority protocols established a couple of years ago it remains unclear to me however whether the delegation of authority rules should cover an expenditure on such a significant initiative without council being informed about it until well after the fact in my view that was not the original intent of this policy it was created to save council the time of dealing with more trivial matters of city governance not to be used as a tool to manipulate public opinion and place council in a subservient role
3775275 councillor halberstadt will always find a way to take a position against an issue councillor halberstadt has made a career of ensuring that the facts dont get in the way of a good story

3775278 obviously anyone would love to be part of an organization like rcr
3775279 i always try to be up front about this stuff but the fact is nothing is signed and im still talking to other teams
3775280 i certainly hope so the sooner the better were very close on a couple of things

3775282 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in

3775286 my dad was spending so much money on me to race and my mom got mad because it put them in debt and messed up their credit
3775287 they dont think its a reachable goal for me they know its a money sport and we dont have any
3775288 ive got to earn respect so they will race me like the way i race them and ive become more of a professional im not as immature about things
3775289 it was all socializing but now ive grown up a little bit and i have more experience
3775290 its a really good program they set me up with a team and the program gets my name out there and even my team is getting a lot of exposure and thats the biggest thing
3775291 and they also gave me media training and told me about the responsibilities that come with sponsorship
3775292 i was at the store the other day and found a card with a picture of someone climbing a mountain and i got it for her because thats what lindsey and i have been doing together since she was 9 years old

3775296 it was important for our clients to have a simple installation process combined with the ability to share fingerprints across multiple computers
3775297 our users have been asking for an easy reliable way to track which employees are booking appointments and transactions and a method to eliminate buddy punching or one employee clocking in for another
3775298 m2sys provided a turnkey fingerprint software solution that drastically simplified the integration process and they offered the bulk pricing that we needed to make this new technology affordable for our millennium tm clients the m2sys fingerprint biometrics solution will bring accountability and reliable logging to millennium tm customers
3775299 our goal at m2sys is to offer our integrator partners the shortest and simplest path to biometric software adoption
3775300 industry leaders like harms software arent interested in allocating the significant development resources that are typically required with a low level fingerprint sdk integrating bio plugin tm will help harms software to rapidly bring a robust fingerprint recognition system to the spa and salon industry

3775314 they had a nice year last year but they dont understand that brett made those guys better than they were
3775315 he has the game all figured out and youve got to factor all that into the equation people think its the system but it aint no damn system brett favre just knows where his guys are going to be at all times and i dont think aaron rodgers has got that yet
3775316 i have nothing against the man i just want to make orphans of his children
3775317 hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his spine

3775324 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3775325 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3775326 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3775327 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3775328 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
3775329 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes

3775348 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
3775349 we are changing the way ocean science is done launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans

3775354 existen alrededor de 350 empresas de transporte urbano en lima y el 95 de ellas solo afilia a los conductores y a los veh culos esto las exime de responsabilidades legales al momento de los accidentes

3775357 el hecho de seguir poniendo papeletas no disminuir los accidentes debe crearse un sistema de control de estos veh culos y de los choferes que sea administrado por el mtc y la polic a

3775384 you can be gossipmonger envious or liar even then your friends will forgive you but try to be clever beauty or sexy
3775385 i dont care if you if you had sex with your boyfriend even you dont be pregnant and destroy your life as i did even you are a bitch i just going to be sad because i think that everybody that eat so much drink so much or have a lot of indiscriminate sex have a big big hole inside and try to fill it with outside stuffs this kind of emptiness does not fill from out to inside even so its your body its nobodys business but i dont want you lie to me if you lie to me i dont know what is happen and i cant defend you

3775387 what i have made clear is that we are happy as we are with other stakeholders to look at changes that might enable insurers to provide more attractive products
3775388 there are some regulatory you know constraints that are often raised with us
3775389 we think theres ways in our reform process we can enhance that balance in the future
3775390 you can see it as a different arrangement where there will not be a five year cycle of negotiation
3775391 it highlights the scale of the reforms were talking about
3775392 if you like someone just walk right up and tell em
3775393 numerous fatigue cracks on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead
3775394 the actions specified by this ad are intended to prevent such fatigue cracking which could result in rapid decompression of the airplane fuselage
3775395 we found there was a step in the maintenance check which we dont believe has been completed
3775396 what were saying is well do our best to pass as much of any rate cut as we can
3775397 the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3775398 that means there is no reason for the banks not to pass through any change from the cash rate
3775399 if you are a bank generating significant profits and the commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families working australians who are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3775400 pass on in full reductions in official interest rates as and when they occur
3775401 we will assess it at the time of any rate cut
3775402 as older less expensive funding is maturing and being replaced with new more expensive funding the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing
3775403 we will be calling on the prime minister to guarantee this measure will not drive up the cost of gas for families and pensioners
3775404 clearly treasury had not advised the government that this could be a potential risk but this crude oil condensate tax could impact on domestic gas prices they condensate producers are renegotiating contracts in any event
3775405 its going to be a question of seeing the evidence
3775406 we do appreciate it is a significant part of the tax increases but we would point out that increasing taxes by 20billion is driving up inflation
3775407 it would be one of a number of factors that are currently impacting domestic gas prices

3775411 make no mistake about it this campaign was never about sen regola this campaign is about and always will be about the issues and how they relate to you
3775412 i have always intended to focus on the issues ive never intended to focus on anything else including personal problems
3775413 my focus on this campaign has been totally on the issues at hand and how those issues relate and impact the lives of voters and our constituents
3775414 unfortunately typical of a pattern that has become apparent at railcorp during this investigation where employees and contractors ignore their responsibilities and the trust placed in them to indulge in corrupt schemes
3775415 not only did mr blackstock engage in blatantly corrupt conduct with messrs madrajat and ward he ensured that a near miss that occurred one night when a contractor ran in front of a train was not reported properly as a safety breach so he could avoid scrutiny of the corrupt arrangement with precision
3775416 it will be a bunfight and cause a huge amount of stress among some families
3775417 i am extremely pleased justice has finally been done its been a long battle
3775418 but i am about to demolish one or two bottles of red tonight because it has taken such a long time
3775419 i can tell you i and my colleagues have been very frustrated by bureaucrats in canberra who would not believe the words of the people who fought in the battle
3775420 there was enough evidence gathered at long tan to raise serious issues as to whether injustices had been done in the awarding of gallantry medals
3775421 we didnt feel free in our terms of reference to recommend the setting aside of foreign awards guidelines
3775422 im not so naive to think no drugs are being produced here
3775423 but after all this place has been through with all its trials and the bastardry its upsetting to see it surface again
3775424 there were a lot of tears shed when don went missing
3775425 im annoyed this drug stuff overshadows what a great place griffith is
3775426 i dont think it will ever lose its bad reputation and thats sad
3775427 not at all theres no corruption in this town theres no physical evidence of it
3775428 but everyone here has been griffith ised were just used to this stuff its been around for so long
3775429 its not surprising this has happened so many years down the track
3775430 times have changed theyre not just growing cannabis for kids to smoke theyre into anything and everything
3775431 theres no doubt this is the generation that was always going to be probably of greater concern to authorities the older families were peasant farmers from the south of italy who recognised the opportunity as a family to do things on a commercial scale particularly when legitimate crops like onions and oranges were hard yakka and you didnt make a lot of money from them
3775432 jimmy said just wait until we get into the second and third generations
3775433 these articles are in the public domain and have been authored by other people
3775434 this case has a big component that is pure theory
3775435 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3775436 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3775437 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia
3775438 you wait in vain for a disputation over things you are obligated to believe
3775439 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3775440 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours
3775441 would you be happy with that delay if it were your son
3775442 im advised that the two recent events are the first time the ready availability of medivacs has come into question
3775443 we will keep medivac capacity under review but defence is not yet convinced of any systemic problem that would justify a significant increase in australias contribution in afghanistan
3775444 we should not be accepting this we should make a noise about it to nato or provide our own solution
3775445 on your last visit to tarin kowt you are on record as saying to the two special forces soldiers as they lay wounded in their beds you can be sure that from your government you will get all the training and protection capability and kit you need to do your job effectively and as safely as possible did you really mean what you said or were you merely mouthing platitudes in front of soldiers who had risked their lives

3775480 we must be particularly cautious about affirming credibility determinations that rely on a plaintiffs past ada litigation

3775502 the drifters history is as interesting as it is unique but there is one theme that is constant the name treadwell
3775503 this is a moral victory for the treadwells and we are delighted that they have now reaffirmed their legal right to the family business which they have run for 55 years

3775516 i was interested in the competitions as it was a chance to design for a company and the possibility of the future prospects it may bring
3775517 i had never entered a card designing competition before and thought this was the ideal brief to have a go i presently work in leicester for a design agency after graduating from de montfort university with a degree in graphic design i draw my inspiration from everyday life such as the things which make me laugh the tonnes of magazines i hoard in my house and my love of 60s pop culture i really enjoyed this brief and was very pleased to hear that i was one of the runners up
3775518 this was the first tigerprint competition which i entered and i love card design so it was the perfect brief for me
3775519 i have know of tigerprint for a few years through being a designer and browsing the web but this was the first competition i entered as i am looking to start freelancing and saw it as a great opportunity

3775534 bahwa berbuat baik ini juga mencakup hamba dan binatang ternak karena semuanya merupakan hak milik di tangan

3775544 both emerging and development markets are down with china and india having dropped the most developed countries by relatively less and commodity exporting countries like south africa brazil russia and soudi arabia the least
3775545 having lost one fifth to one third of their value equity assets would appear to have greater upside rather than down side prospects if there are no major further shocks a slow albeit hesitant recovery may be envisaged
3775546 besides the fact that world economies can offset the disturbance in the financial sector of the developed country can contribute to an improvement in the behaviour of equity markets in early 2009
3775547 while it is true that the erosion has been the largest in india china and the philippines the erosion in india is less than that in italy and comparable to that in hong kong and taiwan

3775572 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3775573 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3775574 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3775575 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3775576 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3775577 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3775578 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3775579 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3775580 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3775581 nothing has changed the football operation is the same as it was when i first signed as manager of the club and were looking ahead to an important uefa cup game
3775582 there have been misunderstandings in any organisation if you make big changes which there have been at the club both on the football side and the business side then until those areas understand how they work in relation to each other then on occasions messages will be misinterpreted
3775583 its been a difficult week in many respects but its happened fairly early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better
3775584 there were circumstances that needed to be understood and learnt from but thats happened and its not an issue from my point of view
3775585 their futures are here theres been a lot of speculation and there always will be about good players
3775586 ive made my views very clear to everybody that those two players wont be leaving
3775587 ive been reassured of my position i think people are concerned that maybe funds wont be available for me to bring good players to the club but thats not the case

3775592 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3775593 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3775594 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3775595 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3775596 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3775597 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3775598 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3775599 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real

3775601 10th annual quality excellence conference how process improvement leaders produce profits in recessions
3775602 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high
3775603 in 1998 and 1999 stocks were really down but the companies then were not really full of assets now the boxes are full
3775604 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3775605 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3775606 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3775607 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3775608 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3775609 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3775610 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3775611 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3775612 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3775613 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3775614 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3775615 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3775616 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3775617 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3775618 this is a welcome development with europe standing united against russian aggression
3775619 we now need much firmer british leadership in response to this conflict to back up the efforts of president sarkozy
3775620 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3775621 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3775622 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3775623 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone

3775633 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities

3775639 the united states should vigorously challenge israels unlawful restrictions on gaza rather than accommodate them said sarah leah whitson middle east and north africa director at human rights watch
3775640 two palestinian students who risk losing their places at british universities because israel has not allowed them to leave gaza yesterday appealed to the british government for help
3775641 abir abu warda 29 who risks losing her ford foundation funded place at london metropolitan university said she hoped the government would help us all to travel to the uk
3775642 sari bashi who runs an israeli organization called gisha which focuses on the free movement of palestinians said that while the group welcomed the decision to let out the seven fulbright winners gisha calls on israel to allow all palestinian students accepted to universities abroad to exercise their right to leave gaza and access education in order to obtain the tools they need to build a better future in the region
3775643 sari bashi executive director of gisha the legal center for freedom of movement an ngo active on behalf of palestinians rights was outraged that the situation had deteriorated to this point
3775644 if the us cant convince israel its closest ally to let seven students out of gaza what chance do the rest of them have bashi told the post on friday afternoon
3775645 the knesset education committee met to discuss the new report by gisha
3775646 according to the report and confirmed by representatives of the security establishment present at the committee meeting no student has been allowed to leave gaza to attend university overseas since january according to the report fewer than half of those who applied were granted permission to leave in 2007
3775647 israels policy was caught between two aims to weaken hamas the anti israel militia that took full control of gaza one year ago by imposing a siege on its territory and to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe there that means allowing the entry of 70 truckloads of crucial supplies every day and letting out hundreds of emergency medical cases but almost nothing else but because israel hopes in the future to have a neighbor that is less poor and better educated encouraging some study grants abroad is very much in israels interest the population of gaza is about 1 5 million
3775648 the restoration of palestinian students fulbright fellowships was a welcome move but the story should not end there

3775655 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3775656 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3775657 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3775658 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3775659 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3775660 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3775661 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3775662 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3775663 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3775664 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3775665 it is therefore all the more worrying to discover that among the initiatives supported by nif is the extreme ngo adalah the legal centre for arab minority rights in israel whose vision for israel undermines some of the very foundations upon which the state was founded
3775666 in israels vibrant democracy adalah clearly has the right to express dissident views but far from being obliged to accept these views a true democrat should challenge them and reach appropriate conclusions perhaps the mere mention of equality and civil rights by adalah is enough for nif to blindly reach for its cheque book but it is hard to imagine that nifs donor base views the attempt to de legitimise jewish statehood as a sound investment

3775669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3775670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3775674 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3775675 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3775676 imagine that america had no system of post secondary education and you were a member of a task force assigned to create one from scratch one of your colleagues submits this proposal
3775677 first we will set up a single goal to represent educational success which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught
3775678 you would conclude that your colleague was cruel not to say insane
3775679 outside a handful of majors engineering and some of the sciences a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance
3775680 the solution is not better degrees but no degrees young people entering the job market should have a known trusted measure of their qualifications they can carry into job interviews that measure should express what they know not where they learned it or how long it took them they need a certification not a degree

3775701 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
3775702 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
3775703 its a sad thing but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids

3775951 when word of that got to me i had a discussion with all the players and basically gave them a little talking to and reminded them of the rules

3775959 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3775960 en tot cas la ub com les altres universitats catalanes hauria de prestar especial atenci a aquest tema i millorar el web molt antic
3775961 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3775962 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3775963 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators mugabe and mutambara have agreed
3775964 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3775965 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3775966 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3775967 why read guardian travel when europe a la carte offers better coverage
3775968 agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
3775969 i would be very surprised if he doesnt cancel the event
3775970 you know ive had differences in the past with sen mccain but frankly those pale into insignificance compared with the stark differences between these two nominees and what is at stake in this election
3775971 i take the long view of politics and ive found that yesterdays opponent may well be tomorrows friend or ally and ive certainly found that to be the case with sen mccain
3775972 you would probably have to go during visiting hours in the prison and he will tell you and his lobbyist cronies of the change i made there
3775973 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008

3775980 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
3775981 inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in that existed before the fighting began on august the 6th
3775982 mr president did you hold off speaking out and acting because of these assurances
3775983 your reliance on russian promises would explain your inadequate response to a clear
3775984 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know russia had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3775985 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3776011 only 24 hours after he made that pledge mayor johnson said it would apply only to cleaners in companies currently renegotiating contracts with metronet and that would leave workers on the its contract as well as all cleaners on tube lines contracts still on poverty pay
3776012 it is not good enough for the mayor to hide behind contract negotiations for tube lines to pretend that what its cleaning subcontractors pay their cleaners is nothing to do with them and for the contractors to claim that they cant afford to pay
3776013 complete unnecessary following the metronet transfer three of the four subcontractors will be paying their employees who work on the tube the london living wage when the contracts are renewed at the end of this month
3776014 that a pay offer of 4 95 is very competitive especially when compared with the uk average rise of 3 7
3776015 are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3776016 we hope tube lines and the rmt can work together to avoid any unnecessary strike action
3776017 the nature of the tube contracts means that these maintenance workers are employed by tubelines and pay negotiations are carried out between the two parties
3776018 can reach an agreement that avoids unnecessary disruption for londoners
3776019 we have seen these threats before and fortunately often the strikes are cancelled but that doesnt stop bob crow from holding london to ransom again and again

3776043 hes just a normal person although maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3776044 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3776045 im just trying to get through everything its a lot of racing and its not easy
3776046 i am trying to take one race at a time
3776047 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3776048 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3776049 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
3776050 when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now
3776051 but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie

3776065 on the one hand its wonderful for people on the other hand it can pose a great danger to him
3776066 he needs to find other beluga whales and he needs to head home
3776067 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3776068 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3776069 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3776070 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together

3776073 george has been giving him advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language and he also emails him constantly about policy especially the middle east
3776074 ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama
3776075 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3776076 he was escorted by five security guards off the property it was rough
3776077 kept taking pictures of his face next to girls bare bottoms
3776078 heh im older than you are yet you have to send me home damn fail
3776079 omg do you know you got it done wrongly its supposed to be the other way around
3776080 yeah i know but this way although everyone else will see it as an upside down chinese character if i look from my angle i can see the word upright it is sort of a reminder to me that i dont need anyone else to think im beautiful as long as i think i am

3776084 two thirds of the 52 economists polled said the u s economy is in recession add those who believe the economy will be in recession soon and 79 believe that the economy will contract at some point in 2008
3776085 most economists surveyed think the recession will be short and shallow
3776086 it will unfairly benefit a few homeowners and many investors and speculators at the expense of millions of careful borrowers and renters the message that we risk sending to financial institutions and individuals is that when they willingly take on excessive and ill advised risk the government will ride to their rescue

3776096 ive known chapple for a few years mostly from covering nextel partners up until it was bought by sprint nextel in 2005 as some of you may know nextel partners was an affiliate of nextel communications and was responsible for building and operating rural networks under the nextel brand
3776097 so when sprint bought nextel communications it triggered a clause with nextel partners saying sprint must buy the affiliate it was the price that was up for debate in the weeks leading up to sprints purchase chapple fought like a dog for what he thought was right for shareholders it was a fairly bitter public dispute which manifested itself in lawsuits and back and forth sec filings
3776098 nextel partners could not account for a significant number of its claimed subscribers leading some to speculate that sprint paid too much for the company
3776099 the nextel partners purchase 6 5 billion plus 1 billion in debt is yet another chapter in sprints troubled merger with nextel in february sprint took a noncash on paper goodwill accounting loss of 29 7 billion much of it attributed to the loss in value of nextel nextel partners and other affiliates

3776125 i am in the middle i will look as i am walking by
3776126 i look from every angle at every opportunity mall mirrors microwave reflections puddles of water everything but seriously i dont conscientiously look at the mirror more than about three times during the day and its only because i may have something in my teeth so if there is a time that i am near my reflection i make it a point to look i am always conscious of how my clothes fit different mirrors show different stuff
3776127 it depends sometimes i look and sometimes i dont but i would say that i hardly ever stop and look i would say i usually only look in a mirror once or twice throughout the day
3776128 yup i look id say about 10 15 times maybe even more
3776129 i look just to make sure i look presentable the only time i really concentrate on my reflection is when im getting dressed to go somewhere and that would just be for a few minutes to make sure i look alright
3776130 dont know why but i always look this is probably a good thing because i always find something that is out of place such as my hair being wild i never thought about it but i do it all the time
3776131 usually i stop wink at myself then flex and make kissy faces you know all the typical stuff
3776132 facebook took a step toward standardizing the wild world of web metrics by switching its engagement rating for applications from reporting daily usage to measuring monthly active users
3776133 the social networking site disclosed the change last week via a company blog aimed at an audience of developers

3776186 their potential negative impact on the domestic travel industry will be far less than expected based on the extensive coverage this phenomenon has received in the press
3776187 people taking staycations are not necessarily entertaining themselves at home
3776188 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3776189 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3776190 for some unknown reason to me theres some factions of the town that believe this is all an attempt to kill the purchase of development rights
3776191 expressed his clients desire to have an individual other than the towns supervisor act as liaison with the agriculture amp markets office
3776192 because of statements the supervisor has made at several town board meetings that basically show in their opinion he has already made up his mind and that he is against the pdr
3776193 i dont know why were being dictated to by attorneys
3776194 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself
3776195 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3776196 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3776197 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
3776198 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3776199 it would have been really simple for them to just say pay the interest ive given up the supreme court
3776200 it is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping
3776201 having said that were going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close
3776202 the legally correct amount necessary to deter exxon and others from future oil spills
3776203 but the reality is the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs so we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court its really in the ninth circuits hands
3776204 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3776205 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3776206 i would never refer to myself as a supermodel it sounds silly
3776207 it sounds like we change into our capes in a telephone booth
3776208 an honorable death can only be given in an honorable war
3776209 how many deaths will be enough to honor those who have already died
3776210 war is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent
3776211 in times of universal deceit telling the truth will be a revolutionary act
3776212 political language and with variations this is true of all political parties from conservatives to anarchists is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind

3776216 the nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them
3776217 all the war propaganda all the screaming and lies and hatred comes invariably from people who are not fighting
3776218 war against a foreign country only happens when the monied classes think they are going to profit from it
3776219 every war when it comes or before it comes is represented not as a war but as an act of self defense against a homicidal maniac
3776220 take away the right to say fuck and you take away the right to say fuck the government
3776221 i do not know the weapons of world war iii but i do know that world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
3776222 there is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people
3776223 if the gods had intended for people to vote they would have given us candidates
3776224 one certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression
3776225 historically the most terrible things war genocide and slavery have resulted from obedience not disobedience
3776226 the government has an inherrent flaw in it it is potentially democratic
3776227 either you repeat the same conventional doctrines everybody is saying or else you say something true and it will sound like its from neptune
3776228 everybodys worried about stopping terrorism well theres a really easy way stop participating in it
3776229 if the nuremberg laws were applied every post war american president would have been hanged
3776230 propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state
3776231 the bible is one of the most genocidal books in history
3776232 the intellectual tradition is one of servility to power and if i didnt betray it id be ashamed of myself
3776233 the more you can increase fear of drugs and crime welfare mothers immigrants and aliens the more you control all people
3776234 there are many terrorist states in the world but the united states is unusual in that it is officially committed to international terrorism
3776235 to some degree it matters whos in office but it matters more how much pressure theyre under from the public
3776236 we can for example be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there wont be a world at least a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles with some scattering of others
3776237 you never need an argument against the use of violence you need an argument for it
3776238 im so sick of arming the world then sending troops over to destroy the fucking arms you know what i mean we keep arming these little countries then we go and blow the shit out of them
3776239 a lot of christians wear crosses around their necks you think when jesus comes back he ever wants to see a fucking cross its like going up to jackie onassis wearing a rifle pendant
3776240 some christians came up to me after a show and said hey buddy we dont like the things you said
3776241 we gotta come to some new ideas about life folks ok
3776242 save the children theyre killing children how many children were at waco theyre killing children
3776243 here is my final point about drugs about alcohol about pornography and smoking and everything else what business is it of yours what i do read buy see say think who i fuck what i take into my body as long as i do not harm another human being on this planet
3776244 why is marijuana against the law it grows naturally upon our planet doesnt the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit unnatural you know what i mean its nature how do you make nature against the fucking law im sure god looked down and noticed all the pot and said shit i left all this pot on the earth they are going to assume i want them to smoke it fuck now i gotta create republicans
3776245 christianity has a built in defense system anything that questions a belief no matter how logical the argument is is the work of satan by the very fact that it makes you question a belief
3776246 if child molestation was the justification for waco how come we never see bradley tanks smashing into catholic churches
3776247 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
3776248 frisbeetarianism is the belief that when you die your soul goes up on the roof and gets stuck
3776249 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
3776250 by and large language is a tool for concealing truth
3776251 if its true that our species is alone in the universe then id have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little
3776252 conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers
3776253 if we could just find out whos in charge we could kill him
3776254 whats all this stuff about motivation actually this country could do with a little less motivation the people who are causing all the trouble seem highly motivated to me you show me a guy at home watching game shows and pulling his prick all day long and ill show you a guy who isnt causing any fucking trouble
3776255 the iq and the life expectancy of the average american recently passed each other going in opposite directions
3776256 occasionally ill watch fox news for as long as i can tolerate it or cnn ill watch until i get infuriated but you got to know what theyre talking about and what theyre not talking about
3776257 you cannot win a war on terrorism its like having a war on jealousy
3776258 war is a racket it always has been it is possibly the oldest easily the most profitable surely the most vicious
3776259 war is just a racket i believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else
3776260 the de facto role of the us armed forces will be to keep the world safe for our economy and open to our cultural assault
3776261 im fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in
3776262 mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind
3776263 an empire founded by war has to maintain itself by war
3776264 one of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors
3776265 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
3776266 no war by any nation in any age has ever been declared by the people
3776267 nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war
3776268 if everyone demanded peace instead of another television set thered be peace
3776269 he who would sacrifice essentials liberties for temporary securities deserves neither
3776270 i do not know the weapons of world war iii but i do know that world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
3776271 none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free
3776272 it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatsoever for supposing it is true
3776273 the first watergate law of american politics no matter how paranoid or conspiracy minded you are what the government is actually doing is worse than you imagine
3776274 the second watergate law of american politics dont believe anything until it has been officially denied
3776275 citizens should not fear their government the government should fear its people
3776276 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
3776277 two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer
3776278 when you give food to the poor they call you a saint when you ask why the poor have no food they call you a communist
3776279 t he people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and then denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3776280 there will be peace when the last king is strangled by the guts of the last priest
3776281 i wish they would attack us with a nuclear bomb and kill us all and anybody who wants the oil which is the core of the problem can come and get it we can not live this way anymore
3776282 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it
3776283 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
3776284 the greatest tragedy in mankinds entire history may be the hijacking of morality by religion
3776285 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful
3776286 you know something is wrong when the new england patriots face stiffer penalties for spying on innocent americans than george bush and dick cheney
3776287 the more the fruits of knowledge become accessible to men the more widespread is the decline of religious belief
3776288 politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
3776289 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross
3776290 when fascism comes to america it will not be in brown and black shirts it will not be in jack boots it will be in nike sneakers and smiley face t shirts
3776291 i think if our citizens would stop worrying about ridiculous issues such as god guns and gays for ten minutes and start worrying about the 3 000 dead and 20 000 wounded heroes of this country we could possibly start moving in a positive direction
3776292 a good song should make you want to tap your feet and get with your girl a great song should destroy cop cars and set fire to the suburbs im only interested in writing great songs
3776293 man is a religious animal he is the only religious animal he is the only animal that has the true religion several of them he is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isnt straight
3776294 once there was a time when all people believed in god and the church ruled this time is called the dark ages
3776295 religion is an insult to human dignity with or without it youd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things but for good people to do bad things it takes religion
3776296 religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich
3776297 the beauty of religious mania is that it has the power to explain everything once god or satan is accepted as the first cause of everything which happens in the mortal world nothing is left to chance logic can be happily tossed out the window
3776298 every government does as much harm as it can and as much good as it must
3776299 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
3776300 apparently a democracy is a place where numerous elections are held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates
3776301 patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons
3776302 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all other countries simply because you were born in it
3776303 thinking men and women the world over are beginning to realize that patriotism is too narrow and limited a conception to meet the necessities of our complex time
3776304 all wars are wars among thieves who are too cowardly to fight and therefore induce the young manhood of the whole world to do the fighting for them
3776305 if soldiers were to begin to think not one of them would remain in the army
3776306 there has never been a good war or a bad peace
3776307 patriotism and religion are excellent tools for getting yourself killed oh wait that is because both require blind faith i take it back blind faith is an excellent tool for getting yourself killed
3776308 women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition
3776309 i turned to speak to god about the worlds despair but to make bad matters orse i found god wasnt there
3776310 i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ
3776311 if you kill one person its murder if you kill 100 000 people its foreign policy
3776312 trust in those who seek the truth beware of those who have found it
3776313 why does your idea of freedom look like a police state
3776314 some of my finest moments were when i was sitting on my back verranda smoking hemp and seeing as far as my eyes could see

3776367 wichita is proud to be a part of this life saving project and the partnerships that have made it possible
3776368 most companies align with the olympics because they hope to borrow equity or transfer goodwill from that of the olympics to their own brands
3776369 twenty years ago it was a slam dunk mcdonalds and coca cola measured noticeable lifts in preference favorability and attitudes toward the brand during the co brand window of the games
3776370 1984 was the turning point however the los angeles games in some ways reinvented the sponsorship model so much so that la had a surplus of funds after the games it was so successful that more brands wanted in
3776371 today sponsors have changed quite a bit there are more of them and the affiliation competes with branded partnerships in vastly more channels and platforms
3776372 the olympic equity is still strong although research shows that it is the strongest when the games are actually in progress but its harder to transfer or borrow the equity
3776373 false reporting of unaided awareness of olympic sponsorships is on the rise meaning consumers attribute an olympic sponsorship to the wrong company and ambush tactics by other marketers are more prolific
3776374 it still works for some we expect adidas coca cola and mcdonalds will still do well part of that is the legacy in adidas case its the innovative way theyve gone to market
3776375 we do think the olympics is a horrible place to debut new brands however there is too much clutter and competition
3776376 it can be an effective place to reposition a brand particularly if the brand is in the b2b space and the repositioning can occur onsite at the events many of the attendees of olympic events are executives just like the super bowl ups is using the beijing games as an interesting venue to debut some of their new international brand activity
3776377 intuitively we should be seeing international companies getting more involved in the games in the future it can become the coming out event for large international companies who wish to elevate brand awareness on a global stage but the challenge is that for many viewers the brands will be so foreign they wont know who they are or what they do it requires the brand to do a lot of seeding work before the games begin and very aggressive follow up work once the brand has launched with the marks
3776378 until china never before has the market potential of the host country on its own been viewed as possibly worth the significant investment despite the degree of controversy before the games began the market opportunity seems irresistible
3776379 the china brand today is often correlated with low quality products so the challenge is herculean with the world watching their every step success in beijing will send a strong new message about china as a world power if it missteps it will not soon have such visibility to transform a lagging image
3776380 its safe to assume americans understand that olympic sponsorship is not the same as supporting chinas political policies that said given the ongoing buzz and interest in how china enters the world stage how a brand behaves in and or partners with china may draw more attention in the future from international media thus elevating the potential for a negative effect on a brands image this may be more of a concern for b2b organizations that deal more closely with the chinese government or in government monitored sectors

3776466 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3776467 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3776468 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3776469 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3776470 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3776471 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3776472 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3776473 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3776474 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3776475 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3776476 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way

3776626 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3776627 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3776628 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3776629 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3776630 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3776631 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3776632 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3776633 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3776634 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3776635 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3776636 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3776637 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3776638 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3776639 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3776642 as the registered tenant denise pope was warned on a number of occasions by both grampian police and aberdeen city council regarding her behaviour but basically didnt listen
3776643 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3776644 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3776645 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3776646 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3776647 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3776648 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3776649 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3776650 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3776651 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3776652 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3776653 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3776654 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3776655 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3776656 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3776657 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3776658 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3776659 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3776660 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3776661 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3776662 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3776663 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3776664 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3776665 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3776675 it clearly prompts concerns that after 10 years of generosity the government wants payback and that research councils are eroding support for basic research to fill the coffers of the treasury or big business
3776676 our funding allows considerable flexibility and autonomy our expectations in return are that funding recipients should demonstrate an awareness of the wider context of their research and its societal and ethical implications beyond the usual research conduct considerations
3776677 researchers should take these considerations into account when thinking about the direction of the research as well as in identifying potential benefits and beneficiaries throughout their project
3776678 research in itself creates no benefit to anyone a published paper that no one reads does not advance knowledge or understanding
3776679 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3776681 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3776686 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3776687 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3776688 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3776689 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3776690 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3776696 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3776697 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3776698 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3776699 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3776700 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3776701 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3776702 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3776703 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3776717 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3776718 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3776719 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3776720 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way

3776723 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3776724 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3776725 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3776726 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3776762 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3776763 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3776764 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3776765 the potential implications of these indictments are many an depressing everything from anti western riots on the streets of khartoum to government backed attacks on un targets to the expulsion of many or all international organizations i imagine that this is a bit of what it feels like to wait for a grenade to explode
3776766 what is ironic is that the un insists on deploying all peacekeepers and pushing the peace process forward yet at the same time it is coordinating badly with the icc initiative which in turn will only hurt the uns peace agenda for darfur

3776787 that question has happened over and over again and obviously the answer is the same im here im here to do a job and the job is defined by challenge and defined by the fun so i will continue doing that as long as i feel that way
3776788 we are very conservative in our provisioning for tax and we had two tax rulings which went our way during the year
3776789 we expect our average tax rate to revert to around 28 per cent in future years
3776790 i am pleased with the financial performance of the group in the 2008 financial year it has been a solid performance in what has been a challenging year for the global banking industry
3776791 while not up to the profit levels achieved in previous years i am pleased to say this result recognises the balance we have achieved between the needs of our customers and our shareholders
3776792 fee revenue growth was strong up 20 per cent on the prior year underpinned by package fee income and strong volume growth
3776793 we now have a higher proportion of borrowers on loan packages who get a discount on the standard variable rate
3776794 the lower interest rate is to some extent offset by fees
3776795 we havent increased the quantum of those fees they are at the same rates that they were before the credit crisis began
3776796 we are cautious going into the new financial year the group will continue its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3776797 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the cba with opportunities to grow even stronger
3776798 we continue to anticipate stable market conditions for our plasma therapies business and growing contribution from royalties associated with the international sales of gardasil
3776799 it will enhance our position in the global plasma products market and will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics marketplace

3776801 in october 2001 the interehamwe came to our village at 4am they were dressed in military fatigues and heavily armed and they encircled the huts we were sleeping in they killed many men and took about a dozen women with them i was one of them
3776802 we walked for many hours until finally we arrived at a camp in the forest
3776803 in the forest we were worth less than wild animals less than objects they would cry out a manger dinner time but they werent calling for food they were calling for us
3776804 however the further prices fall the more froth is cleared from the market and in some cases potentially taking prices below fundamentals
3776805 that is an important pre condition for a bounce in prices in 2009
3776806 from a broad demand perspective we remain negative on the prospects for the us economy and the leading indicators of japanese and european growth have deteriorated however we are still believers in the strong structural fundamentals of the developing world and its capacity to support growth through domestic demand
3776807 looking to fiscal 2009 conditions remain challenging but we expect earnings growth for the sixth consecutive year
3776808 in our view the news in the data is not sufficiently large to alter the
3776809 the latest data will be great news for the reserve bank

3776811 it was pleasing but not unexpected because much of the land other parties have been writing down is in new south wales and much of av jennings holding in nsw is quite old
3776812 despite the correction in the past two years the gains in the preceding years make us confident that our land value exceeds the book value
3776813 the primary thing thats wrong with nsw is that the taxes and charges on greenfield sites in nsw far exceed any other state
3776814 the impact of interest rate rises in sydney is much more severe because prices are already so much higher because of the taxes embedded in them
3776815 we would like to do much much better for our shareholders
3776816 it is time to get everyone thinking about co2 and exhaust emissions we have simply moved past the point where we can ignore it money is a very good pressure tool and people are not doing enough about it
3776817 certainly the discussion about the luxury car tax has given us a bit of a wake up call to be honest
3776818 we had a drop in the order intake of nearly 40 per cent since the start of july
3776819 it surprises me because mercedes as a member of the

3776821 while the availability of finance has tightened up recently over the longer term we do not expect that a shortage of housing finance will be one of the problems that australia will have to confront
3776822 furthermore as we have seen in other countries the creation of permanent government structures in this market can have unintended consequences
3776823 over the past couple of decades a lack of housing finance has not been a problem in australia
3776824 we have had a very competitive private mortgage market which has offered a wider range of mortgage products to consumers than that seen in many other countries

3776831 the problem is that if youre not an olympic sport the money seems to go elsewhere
3776832 wed still get sport canada funding but thats one of two envelopes we depend on the other is olympic money wed probably be able to make up some of it through corporate sponsorship and through our alumni program but in a lot of countries youd see baseball just stroked off as a sport

3776851 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3776852 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3776853 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3776854 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3776855 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3776856 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3776857 concerning matter we have been all wrong what we have called matter is energy whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses there is no matter
3776858 quantum physics has found that there is no empty space in the human cell but it is a teeming electric magnetic field of possibility or potential

3776861 form is the more elusive component of sound sound forms can be seen by subjecting mediums such as sand water or clay to a continuous sound vibration
3776862 noticed that when the vowels of ancient languages like hebrew and sanskrit were pronounced the sand took the shape of the written symbols for those vowels
3776863 space is not empty it is full a plenum as opposed to a vacuum and is the ground for the existence of everything including ourselves the universe is not separate from this cosmic sea of energy
3776864 every cell pulsates reflects and interacts with acoustic oscillations of the medium even the earth and sun vibrate in unison based on a main rhythm of 160 minutes each musical note is therefore united to non audible notes of higher octaves and each symphony to other symphonies that we do not hear and although they make our cells oscillate and possibly resonate even dna has its own melody the musical nature of nuclear matter from atoms to galaxies is now recognized by official science
3776865 basically receptors function as scanners sensing molecules on a cellular level they cluster in cellular membranes waiting for the right ligand much smaller molecules than receptors to come dancing along diffusing through the fluid surrounding each cell and mount them binding with them and tickling them to turn them on and get them motivated to vibrate a message into the cell binding of the ligand to the receptor is likened to two voices striking the same note and producing a vibration that rings a doorbell to open the doorway to the cell
3776866 the forms of snowflakes and faces of flowers may take on their shape because they are responding to some sound in nature likewise it is possible that crystals plants and human beings may be in some way music that has taken on visible form
3776867 as they begin to vibrate they sort of touch each other and tickle each other and they play and mount each other

3776872 molecular dissociation or disintegration of both simple and compound elements whether gaseous or solid a stream of vibratory antagonistic thirds sixths or ninths on their chord mass will compel progressive subdivisions in the disintegration of water the instrument is set on thirds sixths and ninths to get the best effects
3776873 even to the tiniest degree there would be no stars no complex elements no life
3776874 essentially music has been placed in a box of limitations
3776875 although it is difficult to describe the special qualities of just intonation intervals to those who have never heard them words such as clarity purity smoothness and stability come readily to mind the supposedly consonant intervals and chords of 12 tone equal temperament which deviate from simple rations to varying degrees sound rough restless or muddy in comparison
3776876 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3776877 is not surprising given the environment that we were in

3776914 we have developed a working class sleeper that provides outstanding comfort and storage in addition fleet owners will benefit from better rested more productive drivers all geared to help improve driver retention and their bottom line
3776915 drivers often noted that there wasnt much room in their sleepers and the room they did have was inefficient
3776916 along with having a reliable truck getting a good nights rest was equally as important to drivers
3776917 the availability of a top of the line mattress is one way we can satisfy drivers comfort needs

3776926 did you just use a random number or is that the actual number of your donor
3776927 he can be a bit scatter brained but does eventually get his stuff done
3776928 when it says blue does that mean aqua or robins egg
3776929 when it says his hair is curly does that mean wavy or ringlets

3776977 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule on sept 16 1924 the times
3776978 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3776979 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3776980 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3776981 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3776982 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3776983 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3776984 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3776985 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
3776986 glen is a corporate publicist and thinks that things havent changed too much since the days of

3776988 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
3776989 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
3776990 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
3776991 its just how to connect the camera to the brain that is the issue to be solved

3776996 just as importantly opengl 3 0 sets the stage for a revolution to come we now have the roadmap machinery and momentum in place to rapidly and reliably develop opengl and are working closely with opencl to ensure that opengl plays a pivotal role in the ongoing revolution in programmable visual computing

3777011 so we are really focused on the things that are not talent oriented but more of a cohesion oriented and technically oriented
3777012 i didnt think we were highly penalized last time out but a lot of our penalties were technical in nature
3777013 it was a good sign that we didnt have pre snap post snap penalties those things of course make you easy to beat but we did have some technical issues that we hope to clean up we are looking for perfection from the assignment standpoint and we really want to focus on the things that require no talent
3777014 we are just going to continue to sort those things out and hopefully the answers will become clear to us because they will
3777015 so we are going into the game looking at the quality of play the cohesion of the unit of course the sooner we get the starting five together the better
3777016 we will have a similar rotation but we will swap some people out
3777017 what i mean is willie reid will get an opportunity to return a punt or two eddie drummond will get the opportunity to return a kickoff or two we are still looking at mewelde moore and rashard mendenhall mewelde is a punt returner rashard is a kickoff returner of course jeremy bloom will get the opportunity at both depending on how many snaps we get hopefully we wont get that many opportunities at kickoff return
3777018 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year

3777020 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3777021 max wanted a paperless environment that was secure across the organization and that would enable instant document sharing and review
3777022 then starting in january 2007 we looked at document management
3777023 max specialty wanted a platform to auto process both e mails and data from producers and we wanted every feature you hope for in a platform that it was secure scalable easy to integrate with internal security systems and flexible with a disaster recovery plan
3777024 we weighed one other product worksite content management solution before settling on imageright
3777025 our parent company uses worksite so we did a deep analysis comparing worksite to imageright imageright offers a more comprehensive business workflow solution than worksite
3777026 max is primarily an hp palo alto calif shop with a mix of windows unix linux microsoft redmond wash sql and oracle redwood shores calif
3777027 we bought an hp c7000 blade chassis dedicating four proliant bl460c g1 blades to serve up the application we added 2 terabytes in our storage area network to support image archiving
3777028 we did face some challenges integrating to our homegrown business platform
3777029 the iterations had everything to do with business and nothing to do with imageright
3777030 imageright assigned an integration specialist who was instrumental in deployment execution and delivery
3777031 there was a lot of training developed and designed specifically for each location using a complete sandbox environment built with max and imageright resources due to company growth training is continuing
3777032 it is a huge advantage that an underwriter in san francisco can share submissions with any other office or a claims examiner can review a policy without a paper file process bypassing human intervention by auto processing documents allows us to redistribute internal expenses and improve our speed and efficiency
3777033 were looking to potentially expand this product into our international market with our parent company

3777036 he is get this a cigarette smoker the point is what else do we not know about barack obama america seems to love him now but will we still love him tomorrow
3777037 the reason that hes considered such a big deal is simply because hes black that doesnt mean that hes not smart that doesnt mean that he isnt good but if you took away the color of his skin nobody right now would be paying him any attention
3777038 and again i think the only reason that looks plausible is because we see something about his being brown that creates that its almost like hes mammy
3777039 as he pulls weiland away he weiland falls on the curb of the sidewalk
3777040 my client pulled the attacking man after these women were attacked it was reasonable force to protect these two women
3777041 its fair to say that there are a number of things that it draws into question
3777042 since the recent string of robberies business has ducked down a little
3777043 we appreciate all their efforts and hope it makes a difference
3777044 wed like everybody to be safe and secure the angels are a bonus to our efforts they can serve as our eyes and ears and also be a deterrent to anybody in these neighborhoods thinking of engaging in criminal activity
3777045 we plan to be in the area two to three months or until we get these knuckleheads off the street
3777046 i think wed be better off with a safety ambassador program people with safety vests and flashlights and a means of communicating with the police department
3777047 last time they came they were here for their photo op and then they left
3777048 we all work toward a universal goal that everyone has the right and deserves to be safe

3777081 now as the church submits to christ so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything
3777082 wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the lord
3777083 a wife of noble character is her husbands crown but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones
3777084 better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife
3777085 in the same way you wives be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives
3777086 i was at the draft with him and i was right there when it happened
3777087 it was a really exciting day in our familys life and his life it was good to see him get drafted and it was an exciting time it was good to see that he went to a good organization
3777088 i try to be a skilled forward and i like to put pucks in the net
3777089 i still like to throw my weight around i also like to try to play a sound defensive game
3777090 we not only liked to compete with each other but we liked to push each other
3777091 when we would play together on the backyard rink we would compete that way hes a d man and im a forward so we would always compete one on one i dont think it gives me extra added incentive when i play against him now but i like being around him
3777092 i always keep in touch with him and like to know whats going on with him and brandon he always gives me calls to see whats going on in kelowna so were really tight we like to keep in touch we dont get to play each other a ton but its cool when we get to play each other
3777093 it helps that guys are a year older we have lots of returnees and that should help a lot
3777094 i was at the draft with him and i was right there when it happened it was a really exciting day in our familys life and his life it was good to see him get drafted and it was an exciting time it was good to see that he went to a good organization
3777095 i think this tournament ivan hlinka memorial tournament is definitely a step towards playing in the world juniors
3777096 but at the same time its a long way away im just going to worry about this tournament now and see what happens in the future
3777097 i could improve in every aspect of the game but especially defensively
3777098 im an offensive guy but id like to improve my defensive game and work on my skating a bit
3777099 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologize for it
3777100 we understand that the spanish team intended no offense and has apologized the matter rests there as far as the i o c is concerned
3777101 we evaluate players over the full season but this tournament is the first one after the offseason so it gets attention
3777102 i think p j rvi and lander played a great tournament last year said lundh who has separated the frequent linemates this year
3777103 they are two players who have a good attitude and they will do their best every game and practice they want to improve and they like to challenge themselves magnus gets most of the attention because of his speed and puck skills but anton is also a talented player
3777104 we have a good group this year also and it will be really cool to play in the tournament
3777105 i absolutely believe we can win again and we have at least as good a team as last year this year we have a really good mix of players we have guys playing who are skilled at holding the puck and a number of really good forecheckers too
3777106 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting upa can plead for organisation like simi why cant we stand with the masses

3777109 only 61 cents of every dollar spent in our schools makes it to the classroom even under a liberal interpretation of what counts
3777110 each 1 percent of improvement would mean over 100 million new dollars to hire more teachers pay them better make class sizes smaller reduce the cost of textbooks and so on thats a huge opportunity and we must seize it
3777111 we have drafted a proposal the report of the mentor group will be finalized by the time ea summit will be held in bangkok in december
3777112 it will be followed by an act of the indian parliament that will formalize the establishment of the university
3777113 the foundation stone for the university will be laid sometime in february next year
3777114 the prime minister was very supportive kalam has agreed to be a visitor to the university and play the role of advisor
3777115 its a global university and its also an asian university its a reflection of the rise of asia in the world and goes back to days when asia was dominant

3777122 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3777123 wherever we should introduce efficiency and wherever we can eliminate delays we should immediately do so
3777124 in this kind of volatile market price uncertainty is so much it is not practical to take the average price of six months
3777125 but these decisions are more on the corporate governance side i dont really see any impact neither positive nor negative on the markets
3777126 while owls and songbirds have opposite singing periods we think the owl dusk chorus helps us to understand songbird dawn choruses

3777130 i have a lot of respect for people who serve in the military
3777131 he had my respect even before he touched the football field
3777132 it doesnt surprise me that hes going to do whats right in this situation and fulfil the commitment he made to himself
3777133 hes composed on the field and he has the ability to play
3777134 at least he goes away knowing that he was successful he proved that he can play at this level
3777135 you hate to see him go hes been a very good friend of mine since ive been here and it sucks
3777136 one of the ways i keep my self respect and keep the respect of the organization is to approach it like a normal week
3777137 its going to be tough to walk away from rogers centre because the experience ive had has been great
3777138 the government will not allow any violence in the name of movement in front of the tata motors car plant here and will not hesitate to take stern action in such an event

3777141 we nominated charles jay and tom knapp for the offices of president and vice president of the united states because we did not find the nominees of the libertarian party to be suitable we did not do so because we have any essential objection to the libertarian party nor to many of the fine people working within it we did so because we wanted a libertarian candidate to be on the ballot obviously we dont have time to get our candidates on the ballot in every state so we were especially gratified to learn that actual libertarians who favor smaller government on all issues and at all levels are on the ballot in new hampshire and in massachusetts

3777156 i think at one point his actions were referred to as thuggery or he was referred to as a thug we take offense to that
3777157 these are young professional people that are very good at what they do and are very sensitive to how theyre portrayed in the public light i was offended by that reference to him hes not a thug hes a young football player whos trying to be at his best who happens to play the game very physically
3777158 we talk about it and we understand that perception all the time is not reality
3777159 this is what we do not who we are we try to keep the lines clear in that regard but sometimes things are written that are hurtful and he smith was hurt by that
3777160 i never mugged anybody or robbed anybody i got a clean record so i dont know how i can be classified as a thug
3777161 youve never heard of anthony smith being in a bar brawl

3777165 in spite of a very tragic situation ongoing for many decades a potent resistance to injustices continues as well as a firm decision to work to overcome the culture of conflict and of war and to promote the transformation of society to create a true constitutional state of law

3777167 it was a situation where we were trying to be aggressive
3777168 i got a first pitch fastball i was looking for something i could handle got a pitch to hit and i hit it it was great to draw first blood
3777169 everybody makes them out to be such a great team and im not in that camp if we play well and we pitch well we can beat them but it is going to be a dog fight
3777170 this is a dream ive had since i was a kid this is not going to deter me
3777171 this is just a little speed bump in the road ill be happy to serve my country and go from there
3777172 the policy change was a little bit of a surprise but we knew he had other obligations were at a time of war
3777173 i knew being recalled was always a possibility i knew from day one when i went to west point
3777174 i love playing but one of the reasons i went to army was to serve my country im thankful that ive had the opportunity to play this past year and a half and im thankful the army and the mariners have been understanding ive just got to take it all in stride
3777175 its always been a dream for all of us hopefully we get another shot at it it looks like well just have to put it on hold for awhile and then well see
3777176 a lot of the offseason he wasnt able to do a lot of baseball activity
3777177 weve been pushing him probably more than we should have but hes doing better in his last few times out so we are encouraged
3777178 they are the army for heavens sake and they can do what they want its up to us to adapt to what they are doing as they are defending our country and after all our game is just baseball
3777179 the angels will adapt to whatever the military does and it is way above my pay grade to discuss anything with the department of defense except to thank these guys for all they are doing for our country
3777180 were at a time of war which is why were not changing that type of policy
3777181 that is the policy that the secretary winter has put in place
3777182 the angels will definitely continue to scout the military institutes
3777183 it is just within the last few years that the naval academy and west point in particular have had players that have interested professional baseball as long as the coaches at the military universities continue to put out professional baseball prospects then the angels will be sure to be aware of these young men
3777184 we do not feel our cadet athletes are spokesmen on this topic
3777185 clint had the opportunity to play at a lot of places but hes at the very best place he could be
3777186 the whole thing has been something of a blessing for clint the change is a disappointment right now but whos to say something doesnt happen in the next two or three years
3777187 he will indebted to the army the rest of his life no matter what happens in baseball clint would never leave the people have just been wonderful to him

3777194 what is interesting is that after nvidia saying xp doesnt support it they said
3777195 an external signal prochot processor hot is asserted when the processor core temperature has reached its maximum operating temperature if the thermal monitor is enabled the tcc will be active when prochot is asserted the tcc causes the processor to adjust its operating frequency via the bus multiplier and input voltage via the vid signals this combination of reduced frequency and vid results in a reduction to the processor power consumption
3777196 in the event of a catastrophic cooling failure the processor will automatically shut down when the silicon temperature has exceeded the tcc activation temperature by approximately 20 to 25 c at this point the system bus signal thermtrip goes active and power must be removed from the processor
3777197 nonbelievers will be exposed to the gospel in a highly contextualized form they will not be confronted with a generic propositional message but one in which the big story of salvation history as recorded in scripture is worked out in the little stories of the lives of each individual and at the micro level of the local group of believers whats more they will not be presented with an idealized version of the story that will later lead them to become disillusioned instead they will engage in open and honest dialogue with people they know well and consider credible witnesses

3777199 the results of the preliminary report certainly raise the possibility of fraud and abuse at the rhode island resource recovery corporation
3777200 we must pursue every avenue to expose any wrongdoing so that we can restore public confidence in the rhode island resource recovery corporation studies show that anonymous tips are the number one way of discovering fraud waste or abuse as such this is a prudent next step in the examination of the rirrc
3777201 we want to be clear that the operation of the hotline is completely independent of the resource recovery corporation or the state of rhode island people should feel free to report any fraud waste or abuse anonymously and without fear of retribution
3777202 it is important for everyone to understand that this hotline is for reporting fraud waste and abuse it is not a complaint line or a number to call about service of the rirrc or other state agencies that would be a misuse of the hotline and would be costly since we are charged by the number of calls

3777208 on saturday mr stelters wonderful article in the new york times on how people were working around the blackout on the olympic ceremony began as a post on twitter seeking consumer experiences then jumped onto his blog tv decoder caught the attention of editors who wanted it expanded for the newspaper and ended up on page one jammed with insight and with plenty of examples from real human experience how much more powerful is that networked intelligence than a reporter with a phone a rolodex and the space between his or her ears

3777237 going forward a tight credit environment a deteriorating labor sector and elevated prices will act as a significant constraint on consumption
3777238 there is potential inflation outside of oil and the credit markets get a little nervous when they believe that food and energy price inflation might spread

3777241 if i could see you stand on your feet again it would make me much more excited and happier than any praise ive received
3777242 you paid such a great price for the olympic games and for our country this made me very very heart broken we are very grateful to you and so is our country we hope you can actively cooperate with the medical treatment and recover as soon as possible
3777243 if i asked them to be more careful on details such an accident could have been avoided i felt many things are still on my mind i always felt i didnt do my job well
3777244 you guys zhang and his co directors have created a miracle for the world and i will do the same for all you three
3777245 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3777246 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3777247 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3777248 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3777249 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
3777250 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3777251 how many people can you find who have a good heart to help other people in this world
3777252 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3777253 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars

3777258 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3777259 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3777260 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3777261 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3777262 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3777263 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3777264 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3777265 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3777266 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3777267 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3777268 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3777269 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3777270 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3777271 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3777272 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3777273 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets

3777275 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
3777276 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
3777277 our estimate assumes each of the 2 200 at amp t stores will sell an average of 5 phones per day from the july 11th launch through the end of the september quarter
3777278 we believe that our revision may be conservative and that apple will meet our estimates
3777279 the august 22nd launch in additional countries should provide another catalyst to sales
3777280 the launch of bbc alba is a wonderful milestone for broadcasting the most important priority for mg alba is that viewers and listeners receive high quality television radio and online services and im delighted that we are establishing this new service through the historic collaboration between mg alba and the bbc

3777282 this is very welcome news the scottish conservatives have long had an excellent record in promoting gaelic broadcasting indeed it was under a conservative government and with the full support of the scottish office that the gaelic broadcasting fund was set up in the 1980s
3777283 with the scottish broadcasting commission due to report in september we are optimistic that another scottish conservative initiative the proposed new scottish digital channel will be one of the recommendations this could pave the way for city tv which would at long last provide genuinely local tv coverage for scotland

3777313 dont hit on the model whom the photographer has his eye on if i couldnt figure out which girl he was going after

3777331 we have to deal with an infrastructure that doesnt meet californians needs
3777332 i have never seen california in this condition with the dryness the fires the deteriorating snowpack the reservoirs are low its showing every overt danger signal that our water infrastructure is inadequate six months ago the governor asked if id sit down with political leaders in both parties and i did
3777333 we left the meeting believing in two weeks they would come together on a bipartisan plan they didnt

3777414 people know how to ring up and make an appointment at their health clinic but they dont really know what to do about toxins in the air and global warming right
3777415 so the whole thing is how do we translate the tremendous amount of anxiety and interest in addressing major environmental issues into something concrete that people can do whose effect is measurable and significant

3777504 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3777505 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3777506 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3777507 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3777508 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia

3777519 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

3777536 it is not an indictment of your educational quality because it is such a different sample of students from what weve seen before
3777537 instead of testing just the college bound you are testing a lot of students who didnt plan to attend college
3777538 a lot of variation in high school in terms of how well kids are being prepared for college
3777539 as we expand the pool for more students we are bringing in more students for whom high school is not preparing them as well for post secondary education

3777541 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
3777542 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
3777543 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
3777544 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california

3777546 people couldve fallen out it was mayhem with people panicking and pressing the emergency button
3777547 it was going pretty fast and people were struggling calling out to press the emergency button
3777548 they should have cancelled that train until they fixed the problem i stayed on the train until melbourne central and the door still wasnt closing properly along the way
3777549 safety is a concern and we need to find out if the driver should have proceeded
3777550 if he felt the situation could be managed he may have decided to continue on no doubt mindful the next train had been cancelled
3777551 but if he knew the door was open he shouldnt have continued on
3777552 roughly speaking considering the number of doors on the trains and the number of services we run we would be opening and closing doors a million times a day

3777564 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3777565 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3777566 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3777567 oh well its back to the old maid drawing board for jenny

3777579 obama also allowed hillary supporters to insert an absurd statement into the platform suggesting that media sexism spurred her loss and that demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters this even though postmortems including the new raft of campaign memos leaked by clintonistas to the atlantic another move that undercuts obama finger hillarys horrendous management skills
3777580 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters

3777593 i think he was just a big horse who was kind of awkward trying to find his way
3777594 he was kind of weak behind now hes sort of grown up and hes sort of put it all together

3777598 he doesnt know who it is and he doesnt know why
3777599 all he knows is that he was kicked punched and shot in the back of the head
3777600 he is very lucky to be alive the bullet has gone behind his left ear and the fragments are still there
3777601 i dont know anything about what happened i dont know was he shot

3777608 the trees are moving water purely as a result of physics
3777609 the wood has to be designed to be safe at the top of the trees which means preventing air bubbles getting into the columns that transport the water
3777610 if you had a straw that was three feet long and sucked up water before attaching it to the bottom of your tongue your tongue would be pulled into the straw solely because of the weight of the water in the straw
3777611 if you do that with a 300 foot column of water it would pull incredibly hard thats what the force is inside the trees cell walls and thats why air bubbles can get in
3777612 the wood has to be designed to be really safe to ensure the air bubbles do not get in but this also affects the development of the foliage
3777613 the structural modifications needed to satisfy safety requirements eventually will reduce water transport virtually to zero
3777614 i think it is really remarkable that wood cells which are about the size of an eyelash but a little bit fatter with holes on the side can tell us something about how tall a tree can get

3777619 or who can understand the reason why a chance perusal of a book the presence of a friend or the meeting with a stranger often alters a determined course of action profoundly affects our attitude toward life and not seldom so nearly reaches the roots of being and the springs of action that never after is life quite the same

3777631 perhaps they think that pensioners will attack one another with the playing cards the situation is so stupid its laughable
3777632 freebridge claim the insurance is a matter of course but you cant tell me every group meeting needs public liability insurance
3777633 they are just trying to cover their own backs we should not have to pay for that
3777634 they dont understand why they cant have their friends over to play cards
3777635 its health and safety gone mad and it is short sighted of freebridge
3777636 its a farce if they offer room hire they should have the insurance cover in place for the service they offer
3777637 we wont be using the room in the future well find somewhere that already has the insurance in place
3777638 its disgusting that freebridge is more concerned about making sure no one could ever sue them than ensuring their residents have a good quality of living
3777639 how on earth is someone going to injure themselves whilst playing cards
3777640 freebridge community housing actively promotes the use of its community rooms as the social interaction of its elderly residents and people from the local community is a positive contribution to their lives
3777641 it is general practice that any room hire includes a requirement for insurance
3777642 this can be covered by the group club insurance or could form part of the hire cost freebridge charges a nominal hire charge but then require individuals to organise their own insurance
3777643 the requirement has been in place for many years but as freebridge has recently updated the hire agreement it is checking that groups have their own insurance in place
3777644 i am surprised mr corbett has been quoted 250 for insurance and freebridge will make enquiries with our own insurance company to see if alternative quotes are more competitive
3777645 our guide told us a war had started not far away we could not believe it our georgian friends told us in no uncertain terms to leave as soon as possible

3777648 it was buried under rocks by a tree next to a picnic spot along a rural road between the municipalities of vall dalcala and vall debo
3777649 the discovery has been the result of cooperation between spanish civil guards and british police
3777650 warwickshire detectives working with police in spain have found the body of a woman believed to be mrs patricia heard
3777651 this is completely out of character she has missed two grandchildrens birthdays thats the bit i cant get over i just cant see why shes done that
3777652 i know even if she did not want to talk to us if she were fully compos mentis i know we would have had a postcard to say she was all right and just angry with my dad
3777653 weve got in touch with everyone we know but there might be other friends were not aware of someone may be talking to her not knowing she is missing its our last chance we dont know what else to do
3777654 life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3777655 in theory he was already a partisan but it was not until guatemala that he adopted the role
3777656 it was there that he came to know other exiles and to learn about men who either had died or been taken prisoner as a result of real struggles
3777657 analysis while mccain is posturing for political gain his blustering rhetoric make dangerous foreign policy better to keep it cool and measured than boyish machismo final analysis mccain is not good at foreign policy as usually portrayed
3777658 wonder if french president nicolas sarkozy has any ideas about iraq conservative french president likes obama not all conservatives are idiots just the american brand
3777659 like pres bush sen mccain seems to think that talking tough and making idle threats is good politics the us cannot lead an allied effort to apply political or economic pressure because we have neglected and even sabotaged our alliances
3777660 now we have mccain grandstanding he scares me folks if he had been president right now we would be fighting a war with russia
3777661 why did you omit from the story the highly relevant fact that randy scheunemann mccains adviser has been a paid lobbyist for the georgian government and his firm still has a contract with them do we really need a president who gets his foreign policy advice from people who are working for foreign governments
3777662 this is a genuinely bad article how can it not report that the adviser who praises mccains knowledge is georgias lobbyist we do not need simultaneous crusades against iraq iran and russia all the more so when as pearlstein says russia controls the oil and gas
3777663 the post is showing itself to be a true hack paper
3777664 page 3 this is front page screaming headline stuff the guy wants to be president of the united states and he is taking advice from somebody on another countrys payroll front page thats gotta be front page
3777665 maybe we should let barry make a decision he would tell putin to just take over any country he wants barry does not want to fight as hes too much of a wimp
3777666 mccain clearly demonstrates his knowledge of the region and the players while obama recreates his version of neville chamberlain the difference could not be clearer
3777667 in regards to russian aggression john mccain is talking loud and saying nothing these conservatives and neocons reminds me of a barking dog chasing a car the gist of the matter is his loud irritating bark which avail est nothing
3777668 its dumbfounding that mccains reaction to the georgia fighting is cheered by some as proof of his sound foreign policy credentials i am surprised that some americans would still cheer a warmonger and want him to be president
3777669 mccain is an idiot does he realize that georgia actually started this mess sure russia has overreacted but georgia attacked the pro russian province of ossetia first dolt
3777670 it is mccains service in the senate which makes him a better candidate that obama whose resume is so thin it practically disappears the world remains dangerous especially with too many ambitious men who seek to control it kumbya and hand holding will not change that
3777671 be nice to the messiah obama dont be critical of his inexperience dont be critical of his loony wife dont be critical of his america hating preachers dont be critical of his saying nothing more than platitudes about hope and change and if you do have the audacity to be critical we have a solution for you we call you a racist
3777672 i wonder who mccain is going to get to fight his war with russia maybe he is thinking that if we stand up pound our chests and yell usa usa they will just turn and run away
3777673 im not particularly fond of obama but there is no way im voting for this baffoon mccain the last thing this country needs is a president who feels the military is the first in only option in settling international conflicts
3777674 wills you over with its charm its sense of mischief and its pure scottishness
3777675 it would have to be london this year we had some really strong acts come through one group in particular really stood out and manchester delivered good talent as it does most years cardiff however was a bit of a let down
3777676 every year i say i dont want the groups but we have had a few strong groups come through so i might change my mind this year
3777677 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to insure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit

3777686 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how i would be very surprised if joseph biden is selected because he is an accident waiting to happen with the off the cuff remarks that he makes and could prove to be a distraction rather than an asset to barack obama

3777712 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
3777713 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
3777714 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
3777715 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
3777716 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
3777717 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

3777733 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3777734 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3777735 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3777736 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3777747 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

3777766 i just want the specification offered by tesco i dont need to customise it can you still not match the price
3777767 then you can go ahead and process the order from tesco

3777784 the olympic games is every four years and this race is one day and you cannot give up until you cross that finish line
3777785 someone told me at the top that i had the best time but i really couldnt celebrate until the last person crossed the finish line
3777786 i knew when i came here in december when it was freezing and snowing that it was a hard climb

3777791 wear something conservative mention your masters degree but only after he mentions his phd so he knows so are inferior to him and make sure you look down when you talk to him also tell him that you like to garden and other simplistic tasks

3777796 most non profits do have a surplus look at the roman catholic church they have loads of money but that doesnt mean they are not following their mission
3777797 this cant be the first time that theyve the city heard a non profit has a surplus
3777798 i dont know of any business that can withstand a 200 000 hit with little notice like that
3777799 that is so no resident has to leave because of a financial crisis
3777800 i am shocked to receive information that they have 2 1 million in profits and only have 45 000 in charitable accounts
3777801 i have no problem with any entity making a profit but i am confused as to how they can amass 2 1 million and still claim they are charitable
3777802 and they lake forest would pay taxes as it looks like they certainly have the assets to do so
3777803 i am looking out for these people as well as every other citizen of this city
3777804 i find it curious that mr gonyo does not want to take any responsibility for this decision
3777805 that was the deal that was made and everyone knew it back then
3777806 the city knew it the school district knew it and the attorneys knew it

3777820 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3777821 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

3777855 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3777856 we both agreed that it is not the wave of the future
3777857 that will have a big impact on what the value of the games will be
3777858 the ioc gave us an assurance it would be an open process we made it clear we love the olympics its a great brand but its got to be on reasonable terms the amount that was paid for the vancouver olympics was probably an aberration because it was a home team olympics

3777866 here theres an exciting consumer product at the centerpiece of a marketing campaign but weve got legislation running counter to it
3777867 the emphasis has been on the fact that you can store and archive for a lengthy period of time
3777868 the public interest and rights of consumers need to be considered and protected as the act is being amended to accommodate technological change
3777869 to say it stifles innovation is an understatement the bill was obsolete the moment it was drafted
3777870 the consumer marketplace is increasingly going beyond that apathy to a type of lawlessness theyll just ignore the government because its so irrelevant

3777873 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3777874 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3777875 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3777876 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3777877 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3777878 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3777879 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3777880 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3777881 you dont let people put money into your account and then take it out again whoever they are without knowing what the purpose was and that was my problem
3777882 an investor doesnt really need to know our tv results in order to know whether to buy and sell our shares
3777883 but our competitor in tv sure as hell wants to know and thats why we havent disclosed
3777884 when youre at the formative stages of launching a major service that you are doing for long term strategic reasons you can do without the scrutiny of did you go up or down or jeez you really knocked their socks off this quarter which creates the emotion for the other guy to drop price and retaliate
3777885 theres a lot of benefit for going under the radar
3777886 with a solid foundation now in place and with the integration of the former alliance atlantis assets progressing smoothly its time to pass the baton
3777887 also the mtdna genome is much smaller than the nuclear genome
3777888 thats what let us finish this genome well before we finish the nuclear genome
3777889 it gave us a chance to sort of spend the week sort of officially welcoming cbc aboard
3777890 we made a daily mention of it and did some canadian fun facts because im sure you know a lot of americans are not necessarily well versed in what goes on north of their border we had fun with that
3777891 theres a lot of sort of making fun of people and putting them in embarrassing situations
3777892 i think one of the attractions of our show is its pretty benign on that level i think we treat our players with respect we have fun and we laugh and all that but were not putting them there to make fun of them well have fun with them and i think people recognize that
3777893 since im in the game show world i figure i may as well exploit it as much as possible
3777894 its the biggest game show in taiwan its called blackjack bowling and its very funny
3777895 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3777896 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3777897 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3777898 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3777899 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3777900 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3777901 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3777902 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3777903 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3777904 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3777905 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3777906 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3777907 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3777908 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3777909 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3777910 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3777911 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3777912 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3777913 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3777914 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3777915 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3777916 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3777917 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
3777918 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
3777919 with everything thats gone on in the last three months i had tendinitis a huge crash in the tour de france defending the yellow jersey with only one leg and breaking my anterior cruciate ligament i was on crutches for three or four days after the tour
3777920 not bad but not great no medals a lot of hard work
3777921 to be here vying for the medals isnt a bad effort i worked flat out for a week after the tour to recover from that the post tour knee injury
3777922 to be the favourite and then finish first is a very hard thing
3777923 i am very happy and proud about this ride i prepared a lot made lots of
3777924 im here at the olympics and you see a swiss flag you hear the anthem what more can you ask for
3777925 when i heard on the radio earpiece that i was six seconds back to larsson i started giving it everything i didnt want to lose today
3777926 i tried to go out and beat fabian but he was too strong
3777927 for him to push a 54 that fast is incredible i dont know how he did it
3777928 not winning the gold today would have been a failure for me
3777929 now its time to get some rest and enjoy what i have achieved
3777930 luca wird noch fehlen obwohl er diese woche im training schon einiges mitmachen konnte er wird st ck f r st ck herangef hrt
3777931 es wird so genommen wie es ist wir machen das beste daraus die mannschaft ist gut genug um erfolgreich in die saison zu starten
3777932 tim ist einen schritt weiter als luca und voll belastbar
3777933 wir registrieren mit genugtuung dass auch die verantwortlichen politiker aufwachen wenn es gelingt in allen bundesl ndern f r unseren vorschlag mitstreiter zu gewinnen k nnen wir ein st ck mehr gerechtigkeit herstellen es kann nicht sein dass jeder transportunternehmer der einen schwertransport von der polizei begleiten l sst und steuern zahlt daf r zur kasse gebeten wird aber gleichzeitig im profifu ball millionen verdient werden auf dem r cken der allgemeinheit und der polizei
3777934 die berufung des dfb auf den verfassungsrechtlichen schutzauftrag der polizei berzeugt nicht es gibt n mlich kein grundrecht auf fu ball dagegen m ssen polizeiliche ma nahmen bei demonstrationen nat rlich kostenfrei bleiben denn hier wird in der tat ein grundrecht wahrgenommen das ist eben der unterschied
3777935 so viel kostet der einsatz der beamten jede saison geld das bisher die steuerzahler aufbringen mussten um jungmillion re in kurzen hosen zu sch tzen
3777936 das entspricht der jahresarbeitsleistung von 960 polizisten unsere m nner haben es nach den vorliegenden zahlen an jedem wochenende mit ber 10 000 potenziellen gewaltt tern zu tun
3777937 dies ist zum wiederholten male von seiten der polizei gewerkschaften eine populistische und oberfl chliche darstellung der dfb und die bundesliga vereine haben das gleiche recht wie alle anderen gesellschaftlichen gruppierungen dass die polizei bei ffentlichen veranstaltungen ihren dienstlichen verpflichtungen nachkommen muss
3777938 this is the time of the olympics and were taking about air quality in china
3777939 its all well and good to criticize other countries but lets good our own house in order
3777940 approximately 70 per cent of acute premature deaths will come from these two provinces possibly reflecting their poorer air quality relative to other parts of canada
3777941 we delivered record results this quarter as we returned to double digit revenue growth through continued outstanding operational execution these results validate that our product roadmap and solutions address customer demand for high performance ultra reliable networking in the next generation data center we believe that they also indicate that the fundamental market trends and customer demand drivers remain intact
3777942 i truly wonder how my marriage would have survived if i had not found mops
3777943 trevor you know we have enough sweets thats not on our shopping list
3777944 not today girls we dont have extra money this week for things we dont need instead of cds lets go look at the banks
3777945 however the fact that petrol consumption has gone down cannot only be due to or ethanol fueled cars but is also caused by people actually driving less
3777946 a four to five percent drop would not have surprised me so much in june a high petrol price usually precedes a drop in sales historically we have dropped a couple of percent but now it is seven percent and this is more than i expected
3777947 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town

3777949 this is a great opportunity to take part in a unique backyard conservation project our studies will help us understand the role this creature plays in keeping water clean keeping the numbers of unwelcome pests down and generally managing local ecosystems volunteers who offer up the use of their ponds will be making a real difference to a british conservation project
3777950 we believe that these creatures play a fundamental part in maintaining the ecosystems contained within our streams and rivers if the white crayfish are lost then plant and animal biodiversity could be badly affected
3777951 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

3777955 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3777956 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3777957 new yorkers see their town as the center of the universe but despite huge strides by new yorks cafes over the last few years the most respected coffee roasters are elsewhere now some of the best are coming to town
3777958 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3777959 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3777960 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

3777962 the fact that the parasite actively uses a component of the host hemoglobin as a way to protect itself against the defenses of the host is an interesting facet of the biology of parasites we discovered that the two subspecies of t brucei that can infect humans both possess tbhphpr
3777963 as the receptor shows equal affinity for the human specific hpr hb complex and the hp hb complex in contrast to the analogous human receptor cd163 which cannot bind hpr hb we deduce that tbhphbr is a parasite specific entry site for hpr hb thus the hprhb complex could be coupled to toxins and used as a novel drug against the parasite targeting only the parasite and not the host
3777964 our next step is to contribute to the development of these new conjugate drugs using the receptor as an entry point into the parasite the assay using a biacore system developed during this investigation will be essential for assessing binding of drug candidates to the receptor
3777965 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world theres nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as were liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
3777966 the support that they have given us over the last couple of weeks and in the game against kilmarnock is just what we need right now
3777967 hopefully the fans have seen that we are putting in decent performances and that there is a real commitment from the players
3777968 i dont believe thierry henry will come back to england
3777969 there may be one player who makes his debut tonight which will help in his development
3777970 there are one or two players we have to be careful of because of the injuries they had through pre season and the chances of those reccurring
3777971 we had enough chances to win three or four games but lets not take too much away from rotherham
3777972 my feeling is to go on and try to play my best and im close to that
3777973 that is three goals weve conceded now from set pieces
3777974 it is obviously something that weve got to eradicate because if we are making simple mistakes like that then it puts extra pressure on the strikers
3777975 it would be a great opportunity for him noone to play in the football league he has the ability
3777976 if he signs for plymouth im sure he will play in the premier league one day
3777977 he has broken through and looks as if he could be a good player he had a terrific game against the czech team viktoria plzen on the pre season tour
3777978 but i am also mindful of taking care of him not rushing him and exposing him too early
3777979 i feel that when i play him then you will know hes ready and people will see it for themselves on the field
3777980 hes been training with us for about a season now hes really slotted in with the first team players but whether i start him over the next couple of months or so you will have to wait and see
3777981 young boys they climb a hill rapidly they go very high quickly and sometimes they hit a wee plateau
3777982 we are hugely disappointed to go out of the cup at this stage
3777983 yet again we shot ourselves in the foot by creating chances and not taking them
3777984 we need to remedy that very quickly because we had the same problem on saturday where we were creating chances but not scoring
3777985 that puts huge pressure on the defence to keep a clean sheet
3777986 our keeper david marshall has not had a save to make in these two games apart from pick the ball out of the net three times
3777987 defensively i think the boys have performed very well its just the boys at the top of the field who are not taking the chances
3777988 the boys who are missing the chances are taking them in training but that doesnt count
3777989 hopefully this wont happen but the longer it continues they will start putting pressure on themselves
3777990 we played so hard tonight and we cant express our feelings in the right way now soccer can be a cruel game i am very proud of the effort these players put in they left everything on the field and never gave up
3777991 we believe there is growing pent up demand from those who have postponed buying during the past three years for example when we run promotions and work the phones for a market our rate of deposits improves significantly
3777992 our third quarter results for revenues contracts and backlog reflect the continued weakness in most of our markets
3777993 i appreciate your site and the materials that you have available for individuals like me who are completely naive to how things work in the mortgage industry next time i will be in control of the outcome for a win win situation

3778004 it may be attributed to the international orientation of the journal including the close collaboration with springer the periodically recycled international editorial board and the significant increase of international submissions

3778010 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
3778011 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact

3778036 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website

3778049 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3778050 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3778051 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3778052 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3778053 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3778054 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3778055 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers

3778072 el desfiladero de kodori abjasia fue bombardeado por aviones rusos pido una investigaci n internacional para establecer de qui n son esas bombas para que no nos acusen a nosotros
3778073 tropas de ocupaci n deben ser retiradas y sustituidas por fuerzas internacionales de paz
3778074 no porque lo exigiera el presidente de estados unidos george bush
3778075 mosc es parte del conflicto y no puede por tanto cumplir la misi n pacificadora
3778076 we know a lot of publishers are doing nothing with their international eyeballs or are using one ad network
3778077 our proposition is based around the better monetisation of 1000 ads currently for many publishers that can be less than 1 0 52 we promise face to face to improve that maybe by 10 times 20 times or even 50 times
3778078 we are there to help the transition from print to digital
3778079 publishers cant just expect digital to be the white knight that will come along and save them and some of the publishers we are speaking to do expect that publishers need to understand digital better they need to understand what digital advertisers need and invest heavily in their digital output they are well on the road but by their own admission they are by no means there
3778080 theres a great pc world down the road to help when the blackberry breaks and what else would i need
3778081 finding and adding the value no matter what side of the negotiating table he is on
3778082 well what am i going to do trust some 22 year old yahoo sales rep who will dump adverts in indiscriminately or a man like chris who is going to rock up and represent the telegraph a brand that oozes trust and respectability
3778083 this is new and there will be bumps i dont expect it to be all puppy dogs and ice cream but with chris i can have a grown up value based discussion
3778084 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3778085 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3778086 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3778087 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3778088 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3778089 what do you need to hold to be anglo catholic
3778090 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3778091 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3778092 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3778093 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3778094 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3778095 the mayors personal problems are overshadowing anything he has to say regarding the city
3778096 we cannot stand by and watch this city fall victim to the mistakes of the mayor
3778097 when the mayor was elected the michigan chronicle felt he injected a new sense of hope for the city
3778098 a very powerful and damaging message to the world we saw our mayor escorted to jail like a common criminal his shame was our shame

3778102 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians
3778103 forms part of the ongoing investigation and the cause of the fire remains unknown
3778104 i have every confidence in the investigation being carried out jointly between the police the fire service and insurers and i am sure we will all know exactly what happened in due course
3778105 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3778106 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3778107 esse resultado se deve basicamente ao aumento do volume de vendas e ao controle do custeio que foi menor do que o do primeiro semestre de 2006 mesmo com a infla o de 11
3778108 foram vendidos em m dia mais de 3 bilh es de litros de derivados do petr leo e de etanol neste primeiro semestre
3778109 enquanto as vendas do mercado como um todo cresceram 10 5 as da br registraram expans o de 15 neste primeiro semestre do ano em rela o a igual per odo de 2007
3778110 o consumo de etanol cresceu 58 no primeiro semestre do ano contra 9 de crescimento do diesel
3778111 este foi o semestre do ano em que a br mais vendeu em sua hist ria em julho j inclusive batemos o recorde mensal de vendas da hist ria da companhia ao vendermos 3 254 bilh es de litros de derivados
3778112 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3778113 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3778114 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3778115 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3778116 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3778117 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3778118 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3778119 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3778120 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3778121 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3778122 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3778123 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3778124 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3778125 what participation i have had no participation in boldrin and levines book whatsoever
3778126 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3778127 really can you point me to a time where larry lessig published a piece arguing an issue related to a case he was involved in where he does not mention his involvement
3778128 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3778129 many other people contributed thoughts ideas examples and discussion mike masnick
3778130 mike well not really is from mls who apparently has the temperament and debating skills of an 8 year old when its been shown that hes been wrong

3778132 the latest developments in hr management are about changing the way hr managers think and the questions they ask

3778137 the olympic viewer will be able to define his or her own olympic experience like never before
3778138 nbc is certainly taking the right approach by stepping back and trying to look at the olympics as a holistic suite of video offerings and then trying to figure out what pieces best go where
3778139 i have no idea how people are going to use this stuff
3778140 there are a lot of different companies supporting different file formats
3778141 get content from all the major services like hulu and netflix and itunes
3778142 but not really a friendly one for consumers i think
3778143 weve moved from tv on this biggest screen to tv on this middle screen
3778144 thats the fastest growing segment of whos watching tv content
3778145 its the most overrated overhyped story in the tech world today
3778146 people like routine they like to able to know what is going to be on at 8 oclock

3778148 that will combine personal video slide shows from your digital camera music videos and clips from favorite movies sitcoms and sporting events
3778149 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3778150 the u s was pleased to allow france to take the lead in brokering the peace
3778151 because russia u s relations have soured because of the conflict at least temporarily and the u n security council was stalemated
3778152 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3778153 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now

3778168 clooney said tuesday in a statement released by his publicist stan rosenfield
3778169 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3778170 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3778171 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3778172 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3778173 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3778174 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3778175 theyll continue to pop up because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3778176 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3778177 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3778178 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else
3778179 when companies and economies are under pressure people look for ways to become more productive
3778180 i think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy i feel it is possible that dell will grow faster than the industry
3778181 one advantage of earlybird a germany based venture capital firm has closed its fourth fund with eur 127 million in capital commitments limited partners include osaka gas procific the european investment fund vcm
3778182 the discussions are at an early stage and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made
3778183 as we say in the statement we will communicate something when we have something to say we do not want to speculate further than what we have in the statement
3778184 it is difficult to believe that the board would recommend a sale under 140 crowns
3778185 in the market it is easy to argue for fair value of 130 140 crowns and given the way the company has been performing lately this would be more correct than the share price today
3778186 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3778187 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3778188 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3778189 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3778190 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3778191 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3778192 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3778193 and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
3778194 its too bad there arent more people its a nice atmosphere
3778195 we are pleased with our restaurants here and our brands positioning amidst the wide expanse of the games and its spectators
3778196 obviously it would have been nice to see more numbers earlier
3778197 but we are seeing a growing trend which will continue once the track and field competition begins in the 91 000 seat birds nest later this week
3778198 we are aware of this issue we are already planning to invite more people to the olympic green we definitely want more people and spectators
3778199 the forbidden city takes two hours to walk around and thats just a little bit compared to here
3778200 otro elemento a favor de los secuestradores es el hecho de que no exista una regulaci n en el uso de tel fonos celulares de prepago
3778201 thats a 0 6 percent variance off of our forecast
3778202 we made an agreement not only to mems but also to our county to provide an adequate ambulance service
3778203 if we dont give them the money its not going to be adequate they are the ones that will suffer because we made the mistake
3778204 the ambulance is going to cost us 15 000 and we had 12 700
3778205 its the first time weve ever halted trivia night for a swimming race

3778211 no me gustar a usar el parte aguas pero esa es mi definici n de esa producci n que me trajo s lo bendiciones y logros
3778212 las cosas m s importantes que tra a bajo el brazo babel como una torta fue la llegada de mi primer nieto quien naci una semana antes de que fuera presentada en cannes donde inici mi carrera exitosa
3778213 la llegada de mi nieto ha sido lo m s maravilloso pero este filme tambi n me trajo a henry poole is here y otra cosa que me ha permitido hacer algo que no pod a decir esta pel cula s hago y esta mejor no
3778214 aunque he tenido una apretada agenda de trabajo me las he ingeniado para viajar de manera constante a argentina a ver a mi nieto juan guione valsa a quien tiene dos a os y medio y a mi hija ana carolina de 33 a os
3778215 este nieto para m es el bebito que amelia el dram tico personaje de la ni era que representa en babel s encontr en el desierto y que me ha cambiado la vida me asombra como cambia cada que lo vuelvo a ver
3778216 lo que s es que nunca m s volver a dirigir programas de tv mujer casos de la vida real es una presi n tremenda y fue la que me trajo dos infartos
3778217 porque he salido mal sima para el idioma pero poni ndole empe o y dedicaci n las cosas salen bien
3778218 ni amores perros que tambi n lleg a cannes ha tenido la repercusi n que ha dado babel en mi carrera art stica porque aunque recib buena cr tica esta no tuvo una consecuencia directa en mi trabajo
3778219 ha sido un a o y medio de mucho trabajo ha sido muy grato todo lo que ha llegado a mi vida as que estoy muy contenta y con mis patitas bien puestas en la tierra
3778220 me divert mucho haciendo una comedia aunque a m me gusta hacer todos los g neros
3778221 le agradezco que me compare con dos actores de toda la vida y s que encontr a un amigo adem s con este reparto fue como subirte a una barca y s lo dejas que el r o te lleve
3778222 estamos consternados y sorprendidos por la noticia s lo espero que salga bien librado de todo es un buen amigo y excelente actor yo vi que de verdad le estaba echando ganas para superar su adicci n a las drogas es una pena que pase por esto
3778223 en caso de que les nieguen la petici n tendr amos que ajustar de manera dr stica el libreto no he pensado en que otro actor lo sustituya o interprete a franco yo creo que si l no lo hace el personaje tendr a que morir
3778224 despu s veremos qu pasa todo depende de lo que suceda el mi rcoles
3778225 me preocupa mucho su situaci n es una buena persona y no perdemos las esperanzas de algo positivo el televidente lamentar a mucho su ausencia sobre todo porque al lado de nora salinas en su papel de sarita estaban haciendo una buena mancuerna
3778226 ha gustado mucho el tono de comedia de c mo se llevan cuando se pelean y se contentan como suced a en las pel culas mexicanas viejitas adem s no olvidemos que junto a eduardo y ez y jorge salinas es uno de los protagonistas uno de los reyes y cada uno tiene su importancia
3778227 hoy marcamos un precedente no solo para m sino para el movimiento urbano y lo que este servidor est presentando
3778228 la intenci n fue buscar un acoplamiento para salir en una emisi n como son las olimpiadas de beijing hoy llegado el momento lo que pretendemos tambi n es buscar una asociaci n para el futuro en eventos como stos que exista un espacio para nosotros en esas producciones
3778229 hay como 12 guionistas animadores entre 15 y 20 elementos as como gente de producci n que han hecho posible dar vida a los personajes que hasta ahora desde que se iniciaron las olimpiadas de beijing han sido muy bien aceptados
3778230 hab a que tratar de satirizarlos o sea si vamos a participar en box presentar brevemente la forma en que los participantes buscar an ganar se ver a a un huevito en sus intenciones para triunfar en esa prueba
3778231 tengo que decirles que antes de lanzar las c psulas televisa hizo una prueba y salimos con resultados pticos bien cali cados pues la gente que las vio les agradaron
3778232 trabajar con brozo es una delicia venimos trabajando juntos en radio desde hace como cinco a os todos los d as y ya nos conocemos muy bien como nuestros ritmos y maneras de pensar en much simas cosas
3778233 la genialidad de brozo radica en que no se pierde la profundidad ni seriedad de los temas a pesar de que est s frente a un payaso que alburea te obliga a estar bien informado adem s tenemos un gran equipo para ofrecer la mejor cobertura aqu desde televisa
3778234 lo que est bamos buscando es que hubiera la atm sfera ideal claro que vamos a trabajar pero tambi n nos vamos a divertir a lo largo de los a os los comunicadores no se prestaban para combinar el humor con la informaci n pero carlos tiene esa facilidad
3778235 existe una qu mica entre lo que hacemos y lo que pensamos tenemos muy presente que hay cosas delicadas otras en las que se pueden chacotear sin l mites otras donde debe haber profundidad y el humor no debe de estorbar en todo esto
3778236 yo no compito con l en ese asunto del albur y hacerle segunda eso es como una pelea de mini mosca contra s per pesado creo que ni brozo me hace segunda a m ni yo le hago segunda a brozo hay una gran compatibilidad entre nosotros
3778237 a lo largo de los a os ha sido una lucha dif cil establecer el humor como centro de atenci n de las cosas importantes de la vida y no nada m s del descanso o la distracci n de tratar de demostrar que el humor tambi n es til
3778238 es peligroso que salga en libertad pero no s lo para nosotros sino tambi n para l
3778239 hay tantas personas que tienen aversi n por chapman que lo mejor para l es quedarse en la c rcel
3778240 there are other threads of this issue that are being investigated as well and these other threads will continue to be investigated
3778241 over the 20 years since he left nobody has ever asked me a question about felner until today
3778242 bringing these vehicles to market requires continued commitment from government and industry building convenient accessible hydrogen stations is crucial in the next five years
3778243 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
3778244 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3778245 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3778246 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3778247 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3778248 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3778249 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3778250 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3778251 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3778252 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3778253 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3778254 until recently there were only limited software tools and scientific workflows available to help us automatically produce high quality data sets surrounding each of abcams thousands of antibody targets we need these data sets to help our customers find the right products
3778255 we were looking for solutions for supporting our team of experts and were impressed by the advanced technologies of transinsight the fact that the company operates the semantic search engine gopubmed org and has extensive bioinformatics and protein databases expertise made the decision to work with transinsight easy
3778256 it is good to see how we can significantly enhance our customers performance by improving their data quality and thus freeing their staff from an unnecessary burden
3778257 its russia on the attack now and italy are following them
3778258 from the errors of others a wise man corrects his own
3778259 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3778260 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3778261 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3778262 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3778263 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland
3778264 theres opportunity in the space between web apis and raw cloud computing
3778265 soon all youre going to need is a terminal and net connection but until then there are opportunities to build up file systems system admin services and other things we can do with web apis
3778266 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3778267 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3778268 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3778269 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3778270 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3778271 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3778272 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
3778273 students are truly excited to work for us because we are making things happen both on and off campus
3778274 what i enjoy most about nsh is how real it is
3778275 we are literally starting businesses providing students with unparalleled experience while simultaneously enriching the northwestern community
3778276 this past year we took chicago unzipped to a new level selling out the entire inventory of the second edition in just five months
3778277 for the third edition which has just been released we have printed more than three times the number of books and thanks to sponsorships from several northwestern departments we will be able to give a copy to every incoming freshman
3778278 nsh provides students with real world insight into what is involved in starting and running a business the nuts and bolts aspects
3778279 like every startup weve had some wrong turns and slip ups that weve had to push through
3778280 the second edition almost didnt make it to print we once nearly lost the entire book when a hard drive crashed and now were trying to bring the book online to add new features a task thats proving incredibly difficult
3778281 at one point last year ravi and i were putting in more than 30 hours per week for nsh related work
3778282 but the reason we were able to put so many hours in was because we didnt think of it as work
3778283 with people as passionate and hard working as we have in our organization the amount of things we can accomplish is staggering
3778284 equally important is making sure we take on what we can handle and keeping in mind that consistent progress is sometimes preferable to rapid growth
3778285 im a scientist or an artist depending on when you ask me
3778286 the manager knows me very well i played with him and i know him and he knows me too
3778287 he thinks i have the potential to play for this club i used to play for bolton where i did good things now i forget everything about bolton forget because i start with a new team here and want to be a legend over there
3778288 mr muir little a deputy district judge on the south eastern circuit has resigned thereby pre empting any further action
3778289 the lord chancellor and lord chief justice have accepted his resignation and he will no longer sit as a deputy district judge
3778290 he immediately offered the lord chancellor his resignation as a deputy district judge when contacted some time ago
3778291 it has taken a significant time for acceptance to be confirmed
3778292 ive had in my mind for a while now that if i have an opportunity a real opportunity a good opportunity to go somewhere that i would examine it
3778293 the older i get and the more i play the more im yearning for that highest level i can play at
3778294 i think the premiership would be the best place the play
3778295 england is easiest because of the language barrier but i would be open to going anywhere
3778296 im having my best year ever so i dont really want to leave
3778297 i feel like i can win the scoring title i feel like i can be the mvp if we can turn things around so this is not really the time i want to go
3778298 logging mining and other development on 58 5 million acres
3778299 potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires
3778300 monday november 19 2007 r i p a g t
3778301 one of my responsibilities this year is to score goals if chances come along then i will score people know im not going to run past people anymore i couldnt do that when i was 25 but its not about how quick you run nowadays its about how quick you think
3778302 making the right runs at the right time is what its all about and when you get there you have to take your chances if people think theyre writing dean windass off at 39 then theyre mistaken when im selected or come off the bench the supporters and my team mates will know that ill give 100 percent to the team
3778303 i was very happy with my goal and it was a great emotion to score and to celebrate in front of the curva fiesole
3778304 adrian mutu scored a fantastic goal from a free kick and that put us on the right track
3778305 then we ran hard and we put slavia in real difficulty for the whole 90 minutes the result was deserved
3778306 it was also nice to see that marcello lippi was in the stands because i think i did really well
3778307 this is not realistic if i am talking to a client for 3 months he must certainly know what i am selling
3778308 so customers will know our brand and know that our quality is good
3778309 so they will buy our product and not the competition
3778310 you can earn more profits from our product because customers buy more when they recognize our brand name and quality
3778311 i got my mba from a famous school in the us and then i worked in taipei and hong kong as an institutional stockbroker for 10 years
3778312 if you read bestpracticeschina com you will be more successful at sales
3778313 abc incorporated is a famous international company we have a global network we have international designers we are the largest in china we have 15 offices in china
3778314 expectations are going to be slightly higher this year because of the players we brought in we have had one year in the premiership particularly for a lot of players who previously their experience in the premiership was one of relegation so the fact we stayed up this year we know we certainly want to do better in the league and cup competitions
3778315 protecting the integrity of our nations critical infrastructure is among ices highest priorities
3778316 when individuals use fraudulent social security numbers to get jobs they hide their true identity and history we need to know who is working on our critical infrastructure sites
3778317 black families have been known to incorporate people and create wider associations
3778318 i wanted to take this class because i think it is important culturally to understand what socially people often tend to misunderstand
3778319 now that we have delved into some readings and i have learned more about past west african and african american families this class forces me to look at my present idea and conception of family
3778320 it is very interesting to see the different structures of black families along with seeing the different ways in which these structures are made possible
3778321 since the class is smaller the discussions are much more intimate
3778322 set design was one of the things that i really enjoyed along with music and architecture that were my escapes from the hard classes i took during college and law school
3778323 but ultimately i had to make a career choice and put these things aside to move forward in my profession
3778324 we began coming to the shows and quickly discovered that the entire department is a hidden gem in the universitys midst
3778325 after a few years i became acquainted with tom bloom the set designer for htf and chairman of the drama department and offered my help if they ever needed it and well its been eight years now ive been doing this
3778326 hes a veritable renaissance craftsperson who has fashioned for us some exquisite props
3778327 everybody enjoys harveys company because hes such a great people person actors and technicians often are found engaged in wide ranging conversations with him some past heritage employees are known to have phoned harvey seeking his artistic and technical advice on a particular project that they were working on
3778328 these are museum quality sculptures viewed from the third row and back but if you get too close you can see the imperfections but thats the thing theyre not for a museum
3778329 theater is great because youre always moving forward creating this illusion that lasts for a week and then throwing it in the dumpster you have to learn to consider the level of detail versus pragmatism a skill young technicians hone when working at htf
3778330 they are mostly just conversation pieces for whenever we have people over at home ive also kept them in case theyre ever needed for another show
3778331 weve built some pretty marvelous things such as an art deco style wall with billowing clouds charging horses and cornucopias for the stateroom in anything goes
3778332 i carved on that for almost three weeks and it was fun and impressive but like most things in set design it only lasted three minutes on stage
3778333 many of the performers have masters in fine arts in voice or the visual arts and they are joined by professional actors from the big city
3778334 its a marvelous place with great quality shows and a first class summer theater it should be full every night

3778345 im not going to risk anyone saying that ive disrespected the competition or lees sinnotts port vale side because thats definitely not the case
3778346 taiwans humpback dolphins have been listed as critically endangered because this distinct isolated population is already dangerously small less than 100 faces multiple serious threats and will likely be driven to extinction if effective conservation measures are not taken quickly
3778347 time is running out for the indo pacific humpback dolphin in taiwan we hope that recent advances in our understanding of the habitat needs of this charismatic creature will identify a path forward that allows it to recover and thrive

3778350 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out okay were happy now
3778351 right now everything is okay i just dont know what six months from now will bring or three months but as it is right now the conservatorship is doing exactly what it is supposed to do this is the way i live one day at a time
3778352 de nederlandse economie staat er goed voor en we kunnen een stootje hebben

3778377 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3778378 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with ceo jeff bewkes and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3778379 you have a nice body you should really take better care of it

3778383 given the lack of newness in our opinion we believe it will be difficult for management to turn around the recently negative trend in same store sales which could lead to further estimate reductions during second half of 2008
3778384 we believe that in this type of environment without financial assistance of ihg there will be a large number of franchisees who will choose to change their flag to a brand that has looser standards and that will not require significant spending
3778385 we believe this dynamic could ultimately temper the systems unit growth over the next few years
3778386 initiation of breastfeeding in the first hour of birth is also a recommended preventive measure newborns should be placed on the mothers bare abdomen or chest immediately upon birth
3778387 the first milk that comes out of a mothers breast called colostrum serves as the babys first immunization
3778388 it has high concentrations of nutrients and antibodies that a newborn needs to develop properly and resist infection
3778389 in another study those who were fed animal milk or formula only were 18 times more likely to get neonatal sepsis than those receiving breast milk
3778390 newborns are very susceptible to infection because of their underdeveloped immune system
3778391 for that very reason standards in hospital infection control should be strictly enforced starting at birth
3778392 the cord should be cut with a sterile blade and kept clean and dry
3778393 the three cleans clean hands clean perineal area and clean umbilical area should be practiced
3778394 credit stress remains largely limited to residential construction in arizona california and nevada
3778395 over the next few quarters loan loss provisions are expected to remain elevated and non performing assets should continue to grow but at a slower pace than the 60 percent seen between the first quarter and second quarter of 2008
3778396 an escalation of thus far limited conflict in the south would precipitate a downward revision of these already depressed sub components potentially pushing the overall rating below 60
3778397 with both the government and the milf still nominally committed to finding peaceful resolution such a scenario remains unlikely in our view
3778398 although weaker food and energy prices will help the central banks fight against inflation which still remains in double digit territory tighter monetary conditions are nonetheless still likely
3778399 against a backdrop of dimming growth prospects as a result of weaker external conditions and rampant inflation this will likely keep equity markets in the philippines subdued

3778416 i must have smoked 10 cigarettes in the last three holes

3778419 youll have two tournaments going on at the same time
3778420 so youll think youll need a birdie for your team but you might not need it to make the cut
3778421 the thing to do is to play your own game and play your best and your score will show it

3778428 our oceans are under assault from global warming pollution and industrial scale fishing yet nmfs has proposed weakening the one law that protects entire ecosystems
3778429 this nepa proposal isnt just bad for our oceans its also bad for the fishermen who depend on them for their livelihood
3778430 nepa has played an important role in protecting critical habitats for ocean fish
3778431 to cripple the use of this fundamental law would be a huge step backward for ocean conservation and u s fishermen if nepa is undermined fishermen will suffer yet another blow to their ability to make a living

3778433 the fbis disclosure that its agents secretly sought and obtained the phone records of american newspaper reporters confirms once again that there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse

3778462 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong
3778463 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand
3778464 in some developing countries where for instance there is a problem with drought or salinity if you can develop salt or drought resistant crops there are great benefits
3778465 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3778466 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3778467 condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa
3778468 the reality is that without the development of science in farming we would not be able to feed a tenth of the world population which will exceed nine billion by 2050
3778469 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
3778470 no evidence has emerged from the first round of gm crops of any public benefits they have actually increased pesticide use in the farms that have used them
3778471 theres no evidence of any health problems to human being talk of that has disappeared there was a great deal of excitement in america a few years ago that some butterfly was going to disappear due to use of gm foods this butterfly i understand is still flapping around quite happily
3778472 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout off about something which he has clearly got wrong scientists and others who have looked at the problem have found no solid evidence that gm crops affect peoples health
3778473 we have to move to a more sustainable agriculture and reduce emissions
3778474 ive been working hard indoors all day been working on some projects administrative duties you know all that boring desk job stuff we as photographers became photographers to avoid doing
3778475 aku pernah mendengar kekasihku shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda kemilau cahaya seorang mukmin kelak pada hari kiamat sesuai dengan batas basuhan wudhunya
3778476 sungguh umatku kelak akan datang pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan muka dankedua tangannya kemilau bercahaya karena bekas wudhu
3778477 maukah kalian aku beritahukan tentang sesuatu yang dengannya allah akanmenghapuskan dosa dosa kalian dan meninggikan derajat kalian
3778478 yaitu dengan menyempurnakan wudhu dari hal hal yang bersifat makruh banyak melangkah menuju masjid dan menunggu waktu shalat setelah shalat tahiyatul masjid yang demikian itu adalah ikatan perjanjian
3778479 barangsiapa wudhu secara sempurna maka dosa dosanya akan gugur dari jasadnya hingga keluar juga dari bawah kukunya
3778480 apabila seorang hamba berwudhu lalu berkumur maka dikeluarkanlah dihapuskan kesalahan kesalahan itu dari mulutnya apabila ia memasukkan air ke rongga hidung maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari hidungnya apabila ia membasuh wajahnya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah ia perbuat dengan wajahnya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi keluar dari bawah tempat tumbuhnya rambut dari kedua matanya apabila ia membasuh kedua tangannya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari kedua tangannya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi dari bawah celah kukunya apabila ia mengusap kepalanya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan itu dari kepalanya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan itu keluar dari kedua telinganya apabila membasuh kedua kakinya maka keluarlah kesalahan kesalahan tersebut dari kedua kakinya sehingga kesalahan kesalahan yang pernah terjadi dari bawah kuku kuku kedua kakinya kemudian perjalanannya ke masjid dan shalatnya merupakan nilai ibadah tersendiri baginya
3778481 tidaklah seseorang dari kalian berwudhu secara sempurna lalu mengucapkan asy hadu allaa ilaha illallooh wahduu laa syarika lah wa asy hadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rosuuluh aku bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah kecuali allah semata yang tiada sekutu bagi nya dan bahwa muhammad adalah hamba dan utusan nya melainkan kelak akan dibukakan untuknya 8 pintu syurga yang kepadanya dipersilakan untuk masuk melalui pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
3778482 aku pernah melihat rasulullah berwudhu seperti wudhuku ini lalu beliau bersabda barangsiapa berwudhu seperti wudhuku ini niscaya dosa dosanya yang telah berlalu akan diampuni sementara shalat sunnahnya dan perjalanan menuju masjid menjadi penyempurna bagi dihapuskannya dosa dosanya
3778483 beruntunglah orang orang yang beriman yaitu orang yang khusyuk dalam shalatnya dan yang menjauhkan diri dari perbuatan dan perkataan yang tiada berguna
3778484 celakalah orang yang shalat yaitu orang yang lalai dalam shalatnya
3778485 sesungguhnya beruntunglah orang yang membersihkan dirinya dan sesungguhnya sangat merugi orang yang mengotori dirinya
3778486 ya kalau segala sesuatu sudah ditakdirkan sebelum diciptakan apa yang sedang allah kerjakan sekarang
3778487 tuan menjawab pertanyaan pertanyaan saya dari atas mimbar sedangkan saya menjawabnya dari atas lantai maka untuk menjawab pertanyaan tuan saya mohon tuan turun dari atas mimbar dan saya akan menjawabnya di tempat tuan
3778488 baiklah sekarang saya akan menjawab pertanyaan tuan tuan bertanya apa pekerjaan allah sekarang
3778489 ada pekerjaan nya yang dijelaskan dan ada pula yang tidak dijelaskan pekerjaan nya sekarang ialah bahwa apabila di atas mimbar sedang berdiri seorang kafir yang tidak hak seperti tuan dia akan menurunkannya seperti sekarang sedangkan apabila ada seorang mukmin di lantai yang berhak dengan segera itu pula dia akan mengangkatnya ke atas mimbar demikian pekerjaan allah setiap waktu

3778492 i have always used honesty as the measure to judge a photograph i can remember when i was first captured by photographs i was viewing a gallery exhibit of danny lyons photographs of prison life in texas his days as a member of the chicago outlaw motorcycle club and his work with student nonviolent coordinating committee
3778493 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything
3778494 corporations are conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3778495 the global livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earths increasingly scarce water resources
3778496 these slums are filled with the unemployed and disaffected africas cities are becoming a powder keg of instability and discontent
3778497 we are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security
3778498 securing world food security may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century
3778499 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3778500 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place
3778501 today every farmer is in debt and despair vast stretches of land have become water logged desert
3778502 two journalists including georgian photographer alexander klimchuk were killed sunday while covering the conflict in the breakaway region of south ossetia according to press advocacy groups
3778503 the story continues peter explained that he lived a few blocks to the south in an open homeless camp he said that his camp was literally just a few feet from the busy road he added that you could be standing right next to it and not see it because of the dense vegetation
3778504 i decided to make contact with people actively soliciting for money on busy intersections in the seattle area freeway off ramps are filled with homeless people holding signs asking for a handout this is a different sort of contact than approaching homeless folks in quiet parks or side alleys with tens of cars streaming by in just a few minutes there is a lot more pressure
3778505 other studies mostly just look at one aspect the carbon capture
3778506 this is a first step in trying to quantify the environmental trade offs
3778507 the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions

3778560 we have been leading the way with initiatives to encourage less use of cars by for example bringing in millions of pounds to improve public transport and this latest funding means we will be able with our partners to continue to make improvements that will have a very real effect on peoples lives
3778561 the project will be delivered over a three year period and the cycle hire scheme similar to those run in cities such as london paris and barcelona is one of a number of initiatives designed to encourage healthy living by cycling and walking within our communities and using the facilities within them rather than using the car which obviously has worthwhile environmental benefits
3778562 this represents a significant funding package which will allow us to carry out hearts and minds work to encourage people in larbert and stenhousemuir to travel on foot by cycle or by using public transport
3778563 with more cars on our roads increasing levels of congestion and rising emissions it is time for us all to look at our travel behaviour

3778686 the west coast has really gone off on the hops
3778687 were a little bit more toward an english style we try to cover the range of beers as a brewery you try to cover the range as much as you can
3778688 the steelheads run by us three or four times a year good fishing
3778689 its a really good style its an in between style its certainly not a stout its dark but its light feeling its not heavy like a stout it has a smoky character but not too much
3778690 you cant see through it thats really well balanced its not too roasty not too chalky
3778691 it has a very strong malt character and hop balance
3778692 the malts make it more palatable too you dont burn your palate on the hops the alcohol is pretty well masked which makes it very drinkable
3778693 the red is a good malty red but we use west coast hops so it has that american feel to it
3778694 it has a very nice aroma with the caramel malts
3778695 the citrus hops work very well with a very heavy malt background
3778696 there are so many beers out there everybody is looking for something special and unique it makes it very much worthwhile we work really hard here
3778697 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3778698 but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do

3778706 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3778707 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3778708 conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3778709 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard
3778710 if the mekons at this tory thinktank had even bothered to go north of watford theyd discover that these very towns that they want to give up on have experienced a remarkable renaissance under labour
3778711 it would be easy to dismiss this as the work of a bunch of wonkers but its quite clear that
3778712 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3778713 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3778714 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3778715 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3778716 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3778717 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3778718 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3778719 i mean to tell us were all going to get interviews thats really a nice thing
3778720 id really like to work in a place like this where everyone gets a chance
3778721 the bush administration has ignored the problem of climate change now they are blocking the states from taking action
3778722 the decision by the epa to deny californias waiver request leaves states no choice but to file this appeal
3778723 while it is good that the epa is finally recognizing that greenhouse gasses contribute to climate change and therefore pose a global threat the agency offers as a solution a program that will take more than a dozen years to achieve

3778857 we need to be on the lookout for overcare an emotional habit that people commonly resort to when things are feeling unstable people can think that if theyre not worrying or obsessing over a person situation or outcome it must mean theyre not caring enough the need to worry or obsess is really just a mental and emotional habit it is possible to find an inner peace and security during stressful circumstances the stronger our foundation of inner security the more resilient we are the quicker we can recover from overcare and feelings of worry stress and anxiety and the less well drain our precious inner resources
3778858 overcare is often disguised as angst worry concern sympathy or even sentiment and can lead to stress related health issues such as headaches backaches high blood pressure digestive issues and hormonal imbalances although both men and women can experience overcare and related physical complaints our society tends to train and expect women to be caregivers so they tend to be more prone to overcaring about people or situations

3778912 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3778913 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3778914 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3778915 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3778916 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
3778917 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
3778918 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
3778919 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
3778920 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
3778921 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
3778922 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got
3778923 someone responsible for components of the mbtas fare collection system
3778924 we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them
3778925 and at that point we declined to provide the slides until we had an opportunity to see what the complaint said
3778926 note that we absolutely are not disclosing everything we found in this report
3778927 please understand that rhetoric aside the intention was to provide an interesting and useful talk but not one that would enable people to defraud the massachusetts bay transit system
3778928 just because something can be hacked doesnt mean there is some duty to expose the vulnerability thats rationalizing away their crime
3778929 if i poke the safe here it breaks and all the money falls out
3778930 fly by the seat of the pants and hope we dont fuck up too badly along the way
3778931 ok a few jackasses are jumping the turnstyle loss is acceptable compared to the millions it would cost to revamp
3778932 look these people can cheat thats not fair you have to stop these cheaters i dont know you youre customers dont know me you dont know me but you have to spend a million dollars to re write this program because its vulnerable and your customers could be exposed and oh yea im not telling you in privat im going to hold a convention and tell lots of people
3778933 there has been a string of rulings as of late where some fossil judge has made a ruling that will have unintended long term consequences for the worse
3778934 say for instance youre brother teaches you how to hack a gas pump then you hack a gas pump your brother is guilty of conspiracy
3778935 an agreement between natural persons to break the law at some time in the future and in some cases with at least one overt act in furtherance of that agreement
3778936 sum of all fears which was a ny times bestseller and they made a really bad movie out of it
3778937 so the eff has no one on staff licensed by the mass bar so what this is a federal judge in a federal courtroom i dont see the relevance
3778938 goodbye first amendment were going to miss you looks like all we have left is our second amendment rights to bear arms but that may be all we need to get back the rest of the constitution
3778939 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3778940 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3778941 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3778942 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3778943 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3778944 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3778945 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3778946 the next idea im going to share is so powerful

3778949 a once great company surrounded by the smell of death
3778950 the future will be ripe with opportunity all thats missing is leadership
3778951 fire hector or at least make him take a salary cut
3778952 you can only sell your soul and protect your ass for so long
3778953 become true leaders and know what you are about rather than just wear the mantle of a tyrant

3778960 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3778961 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3778962 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals
3778963 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalize on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3778964 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3778965 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3778966 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3778967 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3778968 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3778969 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s

3778974 budget cuts are keeping schools from upgrading equipment and many classrooms are using older notebooks students at our local schools have complained of batteries that last only 10 15 minutes before needing to be changed this is a distraction for the students and the teachers what schools need is a low cost power upgrade solution tailored for their specific needs the right charger combined with six new high capacity oncore batteries can maximize students run time and improve a schools performance on older notebooks at a fraction of the cost of buying a new machine today
3778975 the rause chair features a powder coat grey steel frame with fabric cover
3778976 should be reminded of his mandate and that it was time to see the coachs initial thinking being realised on the field
3778977 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3778978 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky
3778979 in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3778980 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3778981 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3778982 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3778983 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3778984 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into the effects of alcohol on driving and without exception each one has proven that drivers are already significantly impaired at the 0 05 percent limit
3778985 we are concerned that this limit is inappropriate in south africa where one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic crash than in the usa
3778986 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 percent limit for professional drivers
3778987 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit the mixed message of having a different limit for ordinary drivers is impeding the fight against drunkenness on our roads
3778988 the more risk factors we can eliminate from the roads the safer theyll become
3778989 despite numerous efforts over the past ten years there has not been a wide scale decline in the social acceptability of drinking and driving yet over the same period smokers have gone from being perfectly acceptable to social pariahs

3778993 i did not know where the bullet hit the deceased and if he was dead or alive

3778995 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
3778996 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
3778997 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3778998 when children step out in the world they have to deal with different faiths and religions its a good way for teachers to educate students as long as no one is proselytizing or pushing it down someones throat
3778999 penalizing christian students for expressing their beliefs in the classroom is unacceptable under the constitution
3779000 the first amendment exists to protect private speakers not to enable religious discrimination by government officials the court of appeals unprecedented classification of student religious speech as an offense worthy of censorship should be reversed
3779001 the jail was understaffed overpopulated dirty and there were a lot of issues on the law enforcement side that needed accountability
3779002 does that mean youre at odds with them no it doesnt it means you just dont agree on an issue
3779003 we recognize that users in small office environments have unique printing needs and the bizhub c200 is an ideal fit for this segment
3779004 the bizhub c200 extends our award winning color product line into this key segment and will enable konica minolta to continue our momentum
3779005 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
3779006 university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
3779007 the spelling of the word judgement for example is now widely accepted as a variant of judgment so why cant truely be accepted as a variant spelling of truly
3779008 all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
3779009 hey lets look on ebay and see how much they sell for maybe we should auction them off

3779019 now if someone wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the citizens see it here the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3779020 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3779021 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3779022 in the heat of the moment everybody can get carried away
3779023 but its important that we respect referees and opponents and its important for us as professionals to give a good example
3779024 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
3779025 its up to the players to show more respect to referees
3779026 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
3779027 its down to us as a group of players and referees to get a consistent base
3779028 its going to be a continuing relationship with referees we are looking to move it forward and i think we can its down to me to take responsibility for my team mates before they get that booking
3779029 i think the idea is terrific its designed to cut out excesses and thats what we are trying to do
3779030 everybody is signed up to make it work and it will be great if it does
3779031 hes looked really sharp in the pre season games and in training
3779032 that has been a massive boost for him and us
3779033 ive known duffer for a long time and ive been an international team mate of his for many a year
3779034 its great to see him back to where he was before his injuries
3779035 he won a couple of premier league medals at chelsea and hes a fantastic player
3779036 hes shown the fans now how fantastic he is and the goals for him are a real bonus
3779037 we are looking a bit healthier we were worried a couple of weeks back when we are down to the bare bones
3779038 but weve got some players in and hopefully a couple more before the end of the window
3779039 a couple of lads left in the summer and we had to strengthen the squad
3779040 weve done that and the new lads have done well so far
3779041 jonas had a fantastic game the other day and i think the fans will take to him
3779042 sebastien bassong has come in too to give us some more defensive options
3779043 i havent seen him yet but for 10m he must be pretty good

3779064 come friend i will talk to you personally again young man we shall soon grow old or perhaps we shall die before that time and we shall lie upon our bed the last bed upon which we shall ever sleep we shall wake from our last slumber to hear the doleful tidings that there is no hope the physician will feel our pulse and solemnly assure our relatives that it is all over and we shall lie in that still room where all is hushed except the ticking of the clock and the weeping of our wife and children and we must die o how solemn will it be that hour when we must struggle with that enemy death the death rattle is in our throat we can scarce articulate we try to speak the death glaze is on the eye death has put his fingers on those windows of the body and shut out the light for ever the hands well nigh refuse to lift themselves and there we are close on the borders of the grave ah that moment when the spirit sees its destiny that moment of all moments the most solemn when the soul looks through the bars of its cage upon the world to come no i can not tell you how the spirit feels if it be an ungodly spirit when it sees a fiery throne of judgment and hears the thunders of almighty wrath while there is but a moment between it and hell i can not picture to you what must be the fright which men will feel when they realize what they often heard of

3779067 but as soon as we heard about it our ears pricked up and we were very excited
3779068 the machine is a veritable behemoth we have been advised by the camera crew that it is definitely the biggest
3779069 the design was left to our creativity its essence is simplicity using gravity basically we drop a very heavy weight from a significant height onto a see saw which tosses the caber or flings the boulder if youre into physics its all about the principle of moments
3779070 i had to watch my manners as i had a microphone strapped to me all day but it was a good day for the classic bs team as we achieved a lot of fabrication that day it was a bit un nerving having the camera around us especially when i succeeded in setting my boiler suit alight with the grinder sparks
3779071 were all keen fans but i guess george would be the biggest fan as he just loves making things out of seemingly nothing and fixing things when others would walk away
3779072 as the classic bs team its our first joint effort as individuals however we do have a passion for building things two wheeled
3779073 george has dabbled in all sorts sculpting metalwork etc hes a former art teacher
3779074 the fact that its on home soil makes us think the competition is there to be won
3779075 but i would expect us to be either surprised victors or perhaps more likely glorious failures

3779086 in both my band and anis band i stick almost entirely with the upright bass people have told me that its rare to see upright bass in bands that are essentially rock bands but ive been doing it so long that it doesnt seem strange to me
3779087 this take could sound amazing spliced together with the intro from the other take
3779088 eyvind and tucker cover their tracks you can barely figure out how they made this thing its so full of beauty and doom and cool production ideas i recommend headphones
3779089 the upright bass if you can get it loud and clear has so much character instead of effects pedals you have a world of sonic possibilities with just the bow alone
3779090 i dont really have a recording rig per se i mean with the upright i just stick a mic on there and we always record the electric differently depending on what kind of mood everyones in
3779091 i bought the acoustic from lisa gass at her wonderful shop in los angeles

3779100 the polar regions are barometers of change for the climate of the earth as a whole the 19 million square kilometers of sea ice that form each winter had been a blind spot so far and the seals help us fill in that part of the story
3779101 animals that carry tags are just as good at foraging just as good at catching food as animals without them
3779102 longer term they have just the same sort of survival rates as animals that dont carry them so theres no effect on the seals and the few seals that are out there collecting this data are doing an enormous service if you like to broader science and also to their own species
3779103 it started setting in a little bit after the 200 meter butterfly race

3779129 i wish i could make the whole community safer but i cant i can only control and change what surrounds me here
3779130 people around here they know where all the cameras are they know so i got the cameras here with me as an extra set of eyes
3779131 i grew up here since birth and now youre gonna put cameras on me and watch where i go you think stuffs gonna be safer now or not theres nothing happening over here they putting cameras in your neighborhood
3779132 i wish it were done sooner you still see people on the corners sometimes but people are starting to think now before they do something people want to at least feel safe to move around
3779133 whats going to happen is the policell start messing with people on their front porches drinking beer
3779134 theyll be stopping people and asking them what are you doing on this corner when theyre not doing anything at all
3779135 ive been the one whos done the most talking to them
3779136 now theyre just on 151st or a block down at 154th where theres no cameras
3779137 i think this is a great moment on this street
3779138 i dont know whats going on on some other corner you gotta start somewhere
3779139 they got two on lee road those red light things and i hate them but now around here i dont have to cross the road to go around the corner you know and nobodys watching me cept the cameras im proud of them
3779140 we have seen a 65 to 75 percent drop in crimes in some areas
3779141 there is no doubt that the cameras have had a deterrent effect in mt pleasant
3779142 we are working to expand their use in other areas such as parking lots and on street corners downtown
3779143 cameras can be effective when used in specific environments and combined with other preventative measures
3779144 they just push criminality around so then you have to ask whats the cost wouldnt this money be better spent having people patrolling wouldnt you rather have an officer wandering the block and not some camera
3779145 these drug boys theyre one type of terrorist striking fear in people
3779146 and its businesses like this that are terrorizing the neighborhood too ruining peoples ability to have pride
3779147 if i could just get back on the garbage truck everythingd be fine
3779148 you couldnt come here at this time of day before
3779149 this was prime time you cant imagine how it has dropped from that level look at this street
3779150 what this does is it sends a message that were serious about reducing crime
3779151 well go down to the next corner now and the next our 100 cameras will become 1 000 we have to be prepared to do that i dont care where you go but you have to leave here

3779160 de werkdruk bij arbeiders uit zich vooral in fysieke problemen rugproblemen bijvoorbeeld komen heel vaak voor bij bedienden is er sprake van psychische problemen vaak hoor je de klacht bij bedienden dat ze na vijf jaar opgebrand zijn gisteren had ik nog iemand aan de lijn die zich erover beklaagde dat hij na drie dagen verlof nog steeds oververmoeid was
3779161 er stelt zich bij flightcare vooreerst een probleem van uurroosters die zijn door de nachtelijke periodes dat er gewerkt moet worden heel zwaar en worden bovendien om de haverklap gewijzigd wij eisen dat de voorziene uurroosters gerespecteerd worden daarnaast moeten de voorziene middagpauzes gerespecteerd worden en moeten er recuperatiedagen voorzien worden voor werk op feestdagen voorts dient de wetgeving op overuren gerespecteerd te worden de sociale wetgeving heeft over deze punten reeds proces verbaal opgemaakt
3779162 de lonen op de luchthaven zijn in het algemeen te laag en er stelt zich ook een probleem op vlak van classificatie bepaalde jobs zijn met name te laag ingeschaald er moet ook een kilometervergoeding voorzien worden bedienden moeten geregeld voor slechts 4 uur komen werken een ander probleem is dat er geen vergoeding voorzien is voor zaterdagwerk

3779168 actually the first time i was on stargate atlantis was not as dr keller
3779169 a wraith with a heart of gold she was raised by humans and all she wanted was to be loved and accepted
3779170 lots of people are used to seeing me as kaylee from firefly who is very innocent and naive and sweet shes loving and kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and dr keller is not that she has secrets she is reserved she has a lot of anxiety about her she doesnt really warm to people right away but she also has that same quality that kaylee had where shes pretty much friends with everybody
3779171 thats fun to play because i get to interact with all different types of characters on my show
3779172 keller and teyla rachel luttrell are kidnapped and they go through this really perilous situation and she has to step up to the plate and let go of her fraidy cat instincts
3779173 she develops a little bit of a bond ill call it with ronon jason mamoa
3779174 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice
3779175 i think rates are going to ease and thats going to help the high yield bond sector
3779176 these bonds tend to be in the real economy rather than the financial sector and the spreads are at levels that are compatible with the bottom of a bear market in junk bonds

3779229 so if it wasnt my lack of respect then what
3779230 oh it was nothing personal i dont answer any prayers for one thing requests granted to one person usually involve denying somebody else how should i choose who gets the goodies and who doesnt even for prayers that apparently benefit one without denying another how could i cure one persons cancer while letting others die i must either eliminate cancer altogether or let things take their course but theres a more fundamental reason than either of those im surprised you cant see it for yourself

3779280 at last report the companys balance sheet showed cash per share worth less than a penny per share

3779455 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness

3779469 unilateral accusations i think the eu must ask itself which role it wants to play in the future
3779470 we have to decide on either a strong statement with a unilateral accusation or if we look to the future we should take a real role in order to further the stabilization that also means keeping open all channels to moscow and tbilisi and i am confident we will take a

3779504 la situaci n es complicada si tienes aspiraciones en individuales y dobles tienes que jugar seis partidos en siete d as m s otros cinco de dobles si quieres aspirar a la medalla de oro en ambas competiciones

3779507 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

3779515 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3779516 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3779517 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3779518 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3779519 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

3779537 exige al lector asumir que la acci n transcurre en otro universo con nuevas leyes de la naturaleza mediante las cuales el fen meno pueda ser explicado
3779538 no he visto jugar a n a brasil pero desde luego argentina es la clara favorita para ganar la medalla de oro
3779539 hoy sin sus grandes figuras demostr que tiene un nivel alt simo y que ser muy dif cil que alg n equipo le supere aqu
3779540 debe haber una reglamentaci n clara de fifa en el futuro a este respecto
3779541 hemos quedado eliminados a las primeras de cambio y estoy triste por ello porque el equipo merec a haber hecho algo m s especialmente en el partido contra australia que debimos ganar pero bueno as es el f tbol y hay que aceptarlo
3779542 no tengo problemas con mi rival s que es zurdo pero en mi mente no hay m s idea que seguir adelante en la b squeda de la medalla
3779543 ganar a un boxeador que fue tercero del mundo te da mucha confianza
3779544 me prepar muy bien durante ocho meses y aqu est la prueba dando un paso adelante y consiguiendo mi primer triunfo en unos juegos ol mpicos donde llegan los mejores
3779545 ahora s lo pienso en dar otro paso m s adelante y tengo m s confianza que nunca en lograrlo
3779546 hay que reconocer que estamos compitiendo con los mejores y lo importante es que estuvieron presentes en los juegos ol mpicos
3779547 ahora tenemos buenas bazas con los tres p giles que nos quedan y vamos a mantener el objetivo de conseguir una medalla para colombia
3779548 holanda es un equipo al que hay que tenerle cuidado que hay que respetarlo porque tiene buenos jugadores pero creo que el equipo argentina est muy bien para salir al partido y ganarlo con el respeto que se merece holanda
3779549 tiene que entender que venimos con un objetivo que es ganar la medalla dorada
3779550 uno no les puede dar el gusto les pido disculpas pero uno siempre forma al equipo y piensa en lo mejor para l pero si se enojaron mala suerte tengo otros jugadores que pienso que tienen que jugar no s lo leonel
3779551 fue bueno terminar con las tres victorias cada una de ellas tuvo su dificultad ahora a pensar en lo que viene
3779552 uno viene ac por una medalla pero primero tenemos que ganarle a holanda
3779553 sabemos que holanda es un rival que hay que respetarlo porque tiene muy buenos jugadores pero estamos como para salir a jugar el partido y ganarlo pero con el respeto que se merece holanda
3779554 la gente de china tiene que entender que venimos con un objetivo a ganar la medalla dorada hoy no jug messi como no lo hizo agero gary si la gente de china se enoj all ellos no les pude dar el gusto les pido una disculpa pero uno piensa lo mejor para el equipo
3779555 lo que viene es mucho m s dif cil no hay margen de error porque te quedas fuera hay que estar atentos y concentrados para pasar de ronda
3779556 he intentado hacerlo lo mejor posible para demostrar que lo que realmente importa es el trabajo que hice y no mi edad
3779557 s que mi caballo puede hacerlo mucho mejor pero para ser la primera vez creo que lo ha hecho realmente bien estoy muy contenta con l porque normalmente se pone muy nervioso cuando hay p blico pero hoy estaba incluso tranquilo
3779558 fue un poco malo para la concentraci n de todo el equipo pero despu s volvimos a nuestro objetivo estamos aqu y sta no es nuestra meta final sino una primera parada
3779559 luisa mont muy bien demostr que tiene talento y un potencial gigante
3779560 estoy disfrutando venir aqu era un sue o ahora estoy aprendiendo a cada momento todos estamos muy felices aunque un poco nerviosos

3779563 el objetivo es que estos jinetes hagan una carrera son buenos profesionales y tiene que entender lo que ocurre a este nivel y ese es el objetivo un buen jinete siempre vuelve
3779564 apuesto a que consigue una medalla y a que es de oro es de lejos nuestro mejor boxeador
3779565 regreso a casa me tomar unas vacaciones y no pensar en ninguna otra cosa
3779566 i dont think theres a concerted effort of oems to go one way or other i think we have best solution in the marketplace
3779567 we believe that is partly because of ciscos lack of 8 gig blades and possibly because emc is favoring brocade over cisco at this time
3779568 our role in the industry is enabling solutions like virtualization encryption and other services
3779569 ciscos vision is they expect to deliver those solutions themselves that creates conflict among major players like the ibms and hewlett packards of the world
3779570 yeah i was skipping and stuff i really wasnt paying attention back then
3779571 a lot of people were like talking trash and i just got tired of it really getting confused with the work getting harder on me i just didnt know what i wanted to do no more so i left
3779572 many of them complain that they dont like the structure of the system that they are nothing more than a number and they feel left out
3779573 we have too many children dropping out of high school
3779574 just go back and hopefully find a career later on
3779575 the ridiculous proposal by pat gillespie and the lansing economic development corporation is unfit for consumption its like a developer gone bad and lazy reaching too far into the taxpayers cookie jar
3779576 health care costs are very important but if i was to scale them 1 to 2 job creation is more important
3779577 the 182 million redevelopment of the ottawa power station in downtown lansing by christman co into a headquarters for accident fund insurance co of america will receive a 10 million business tax credit and use 33 3 million in new state and local property taxes generated by redeveloping the site
3779578 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers
3779579 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island at the same time we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise it is a game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value
3779580 freedom fighters and terrorists are two different things i feel the school should not use this version of history the title is objectionable
3779581 es de momento su nico libro de relatos defiende las posibilidades de esta f rmula narrativa porque puede resultar m s cautivadora m s intensa y m s memorable que cualquier novela
3779582 este es el ltimo torneo de b isbol ol mpico y nosotros vamos por el oro
3779583 nosotros sabemos que un buen torneo puede ayudar a que traigamos el b isbol otra vez a las olimpiadas
3779584 esta victoria se la dedicamos a nuestro comandante en jefe fidel porque sabemos que desde cuba l est pendiente de lo que nosotros estamos haciendo aqu
3779585 al principio no estaba encontrando bien mis lanzamientos pero trabaj duro con los lanzamientos rompientes cambiando la velocidad y eso me ayud a sacar de paso a los bateadores japoneses
3779586 que conf en en mi la medalla va para dominicana no importa el color
3779587 no soy el favorito eso no me pone triste ni me da un complejo al contrario me siento bien y estoy muy motivado
3779588 fue una pelea muy dura con un tercer asalto sin anotar que fue dif cil para mi porque me sent a cansado pero por suerte me recupere para cerrar sin problemas
3779589 keine der beiden medizinischen behandlungsmethoden zeigt einen erkennbaren vorteil gegen ber der nicht behandlung

3779593 die haben probleme die man nicht so einfach nachweisen kann
3779594 aber nicht wenn die frau schon ende drei ig ist ab 35 nimmt die chance schwanger zu werden ja schon mit jedem jahr deutlich ab dann sollte man nicht mehr warten
3779595 onderzoek wijst uit dat jongeren ge nteresseerd zijn in nieuws en ook in meer diepgaand nieuws
3779596 we zijn nog niet zo lang begonnen met onze website en tot nu toe krijgen we een bescheiden paar honderd bezoekers per dag dat moeten er binnenkort veel meer worden bij voorkeur jongeren daarom willen we gaan samenwerken met universiteiten en hogescholen daar zitten vele studenten die goed en bijzonder onderzoek hebben gedaan we denken erover om studenten met een bepaalde expertise uit te nodigen om bij ons over hun onderzoek te publiceren
3779597 de nieuwsbrief is daar een onderdeel van maar binnenkort kun je nog veel meer verwachten op de website denk aan reacties op de uitzendingen en maar ook portretten en weblogs van de makers
3779598 de anjo weblogs zullen geen grote frequentie hebben en anders dan de typische amateurweblogs hebben ze een duidelijke focus doel is om de kijker inzicht te verschaffen in het maken van een programma er komen vragen aan bod als waarom een journalist gekozen heeft voor dat thema of die specifieke benadering
3779599 de concurrentie op het gebied van de onderzoeksjournalistiek is niet groot in nederland
3779600 door onze website informeer je niet alleen de nieuwsconsument maar stimuleer je als journalist ook elkaar je kunt namelijk heel eenvoudig kijken wat er bij een ander programma al over hetzelfde thema is gemaakt
3779601 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families
3779602 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections
3779603 based on your service in the past we would like to invite you back as a volunteer for the 2009 sundance film festival the festival will be held january 15 25 with additional days or evenings for training as required by position
3779604 aims to deliver riders to the podium programme who are ready to win medals at world championships and olympics
3779605 are required to live close to the programmes base in manchester and there are many aspects of the academy life which could be likened to going to university its often the first time riders have lived away from home the skills development and learning experiences they go through are preparing them for adult life in their chosen career they find themselves having to get on with strangers in a strange environment and they are often making decisions for themselves for the first time however theres probably more at stake day to day for members of the oap than for any university student the new challenges thrown at them have to be tackled against a background of high levels of self discipline and year round performance expectations of course for the aspiring professional cyclist sacrifices of lifestyle are a small price to pay in return for a chance to chase personal goals
3779606 was all about learning hard work and rod ellingworth the academys director was strict if we didnt perform in a race we would be doing three hours around the top of the track in manchester or 150km team time trials in a single line maybe on a small circuit just to make it harder he would hide in the bushes to make sure we werent slacking i knew he wasnt doing it to spite us but to help us i knew the position i was in i knew how much he could help me if you get that into your mind it can work well for you
3779607 as with the whole cycling programme from talent team through to olympic podium programme senior gb team there is a gradual move from skills training to physical conditioning the first year in the academy is usually heavily skills focused but as rider progress they will find themselves experiencing the progressive workload increases that they will have to handle if they are to succeed at the very highest levels
3779608 the olympics are the pinnacle of the lottery funded programme the academy for me the tour de france this year was a huge objective but as far as the games are concerned its medal or nothing ill be really disappointed if bradley wiggins and i dont win the madison and if we dont get a medal we will have failed miserably this is what we have been building for since i moved into that flat in fallowfield
3779609 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3779610 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3779614 the recycling journeys show that separating your cans glass bottles and jars paper cardboard and plastic bottles really is worthwhile recycling saves raw materials and energy from being used to make new products as well as saving valuable landfill space
3779615 we hope that showing residents what happens to their waste will encourage them to continue taking part in the kerbside collection service as well as using our network of recycling centres and points

3779641 in the pre olympic tournament we played russia and we beat them by six points we also played america the united states and i think we had a pretty good game in the end we lost only by 10 points but for latvia it was the first time we ever played america and we think we did pretty good

3779655 this is the ninth year ive played in the tournament the first year i got second but i havent played well the last couple years
3779656 this is the tournament i look forward to every year because you are playing against everyone for bragging rights and its good momentum heading into the high school season
3779657 kelby is a solid player he has improved a lot
3779658 he could by all means win the tournament its easy to overlook him because he is not in your age division but you cant overlook him because he could easily go shoot a 73 and a 73 the next two days and win it

3779668 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3779669 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3779670 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3779675 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3779676 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3779677 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3779678 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3779679 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3779680 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3779681 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3779682 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3779683 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3779684 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3779685 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3779686 you know what i need a hollow golf club i can relieve myself in

3779692 we are very pleased with the results of the bounty well and production testing indicates that we have drilled one of the best natural gas wells offshore trinidad
3779693 this investment enables us to produce a new generation of world class vehicles that meet the diverse needs of our consumers around the globe
3779694 the investment will be used for state of the art manufacturing systems including a 285 000 square foot expansion of the jefferson north plant including a new body shop that will allow increased flexibility and higher output
3779695 it is important to note that the hedging loss for the quarter was non cash and does not necessarily reflect the expected future cash settlement value of the contracts
3779696 as of june 30 the oil hedged represents less than one third of enterras oil production and therefore any actual cash cost of these hedges will be more than offset by higher prices received on the non hedged production

3779709 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3779710 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3779711 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3779712 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3779713 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3779718 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
3779719 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem

3779729 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop graphics processor
3779730 we believe its too early to call a gross margin and pricing bottom
3779731 with respect to pricing while competitive pressure may not worsen in the near term we are concerned with the secular shift to low end desktops notebooks and its long term effect of nvidia gross margin
3779732 did not provide much that was concrete for investors to grasp on to aside from a 1 billion expansion of the companys share buyback and the acknowledgment by the company that the next step is to reevaluate its cost structure
3779733 nvidia will emerge as the sole significant standalone pc graphics vendor
3779734 although amds graphics products may put pricing pressure on nvidia near term in the past nvidia has shown remarkable capacity to regroup and recapture lost share
3779735 the wild card remains the u s and world economies we believe nvidia stock remains undervalued though investors who believe the macro environment will deteriorate further before it begins to improve will probably want to wait for the turn

3779745 we grew up in a very small town in northern california and have always loved to find vintage pieces both clothes and jewelry and make them fresh and new by tweaking or redesigning them in some way
3779746 whenever were traveling we like to scope out local thrift and vintage stores we drove cross country this past summer from los angeles to new york and thought the state of texas had amazing vintage not to mention the people are super nice and you can drive 80 miles per hour through a lot of the state

3779757 since then attackers have fine tuned their exploits resulting in even more widespread attacks
3779758 the snapshot viewer issue impacts any internet explorer 7 users that have the activex control installed and any internet explorer 6 users regardless if they have the control installed or not the nature of the control allows the attacker to install malicious code and exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction
3779759 once exploit code for the dns vulnerability announced in july became available microsoft took the unusual step to issue this security advisory that encouraged customers to update their dns servers asap even though the original bulletin rating was an important and not as critical
3779760 given the publicly available exploit code and the possible compromise of critical dns services it teams that have not deployed this update should give it top priority
3779761 since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled the bad thing about microsoft announcing a patch and then pulling it is that it lets everyone know where to look and that there is something there to be found
3779762 its like being given a treasure map thats half completed theres still a lot of space to cover but its significantly smaller than if you had no insight at all

3779798 challenging market conditions particularly those affecting small and micro cap companies have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of initial public offerings ipos and private equity transactions taking place
3779799 during the first six months of 2007 there were 147 ipos completed in the u s markets while only 42 have been completed in 2008 thus far whats more 56 companies have cancelled planned ipos since the first of this year as a consequence investment banking firms nationwide have suffered and our company is no exception

3779828 today our military is serving our nation in iraq afghanistan and many other parts of the world
3779829 by once again permitting access to accredited members of the media at military commemoration ceremonies memorial services conducted by the armed forces and the arrival of the remains of fallen service members at u s military installations this legislation would honor those who have given their lives in defense of our nation

3779842 its been a very difficult thing for me because ive never endorsed a democrat before but sometimes in life you come to a juncture where its very clear the national interest trumps party discipline
3779843 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3779844 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of nonideological bipartisan decision making
3779845 barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure
3779846 it is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition theres an emphasis on individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3779847 above anything else im convinced the national interest requires a new approach to our interactions with the world

3779948 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3779949 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
