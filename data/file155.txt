1550136 en los ltimos a os nos hemos centrado mucho en aumentar el n mero de pacientes en tratamiento pero parece que hemos descuidado un poco las tareas de prevenci n clave para frenar la epidemia de sida
1550137 por primera vez en nuestra historia hemos dedicado un monogr fico a la prevenci n y esperamos que sea el ltimo porque eso significar que las medidas empiezan a dar resultado
1550138 la falta de programas de salud p blica es en gran parte responsable de que casi 2 5 millones de personas se infecten con el virus cada a o es escandaloso que las campa as para fomentar el acceso a los medicamentos no hayan ido acompa adas de el mismo esfuerzo en estrategias de prevenci n
1550139 las instituciones deben ser m s honestas y admitir los fallos los esfuerzos preventivos han sido simplemente escasos
1550140 el grado de esfuerzos realizados hasta ahora no es el suficiente
1550141 debemos tener el coraje de seguir adelante porque si fallamos en el desaf o de la prevenci n del vih el sida minar implacablemente el progreso humano
1550142 ninguno de los xitos alcanzados en el pasado en la prevenci n del sida ha sido f cil el desaf o ahora es lograr una compleja y efectiva combinaci n de esfuerzos a largo plazo
1550143 la d cada de los 90 fue la de las oportunidades perdidas el virus sigui avanzando ante la pasividad de la sociedad
1550144 si se intensifica una buena prevenci n combinada podr an evitarse 12 millones de nuevas infecciones desde ahora hasta 2015
1550145 la tr gica realidad es que no se ha proporcionado un enfoque claro para asegurarse que todos los j venes tienen la informaci n que necesitan antes de practicar el sexo
1550146 si queremos que las estrategias funcionen debemos empezar por analizar a fondo cu les han sido eficaces hasta la fecha y cu les no y adem s es necesario que se unan dentro de un paquete de medidas y que no vaya cada una por libre porque no se conseguir nada
1550147 tener claro a qui n dirigimos la prevenci n es fundamental que conozcamos las caracter sticas de las epidemias locales

1550173 article 6 section 3 of the united states constitution specifically prohibits religious tests as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states to my mind your question constitutes just such a test and violates the spirit if not the letter of the constitution it could simply be that you are unaware of this part of the constitution however it may be that you are attempting to deliberately subvert that part of the constitution for an ulterior motive one of the most un american things i can imagine in any case i will not take the bait it is for those reasons that i refuse to answer the question

1550254 you put so much money into just being in their wedding
1550255 it would make all the difference if the bride said this is your gift
1550256 it was a black lace baby doll dress what she was trying to do was have a dress that wasnt too expensive and something we could wear again but it was horrendous and really tacky
1550257 we wanted her to pick a dress that looked good on all of us

1550262 i ate 2 5 grams of shrooms for the show honestly it was the closest thing i had to a religious spiritual awakening obviously sober you still go through a very powerful range of emotions and strange thoughts you never have experienced while listening to these guys play but this was by far the most intense thing i have ever been apart of the lighting was spectactular the crowd felt like it had a unified bond and that we all were feeling the exact same energy from the lawn seats i would just stare in the middle of the crowd and watch all the neon glowsticks and lights being thrown in the air while countless people lost them self like thom and began to go into a trance induced dance the band did not miss a beat and im still getting chills thinking about eds background vocals in weird fishes and johnnys chorus riff in lucky much of the time i found myself sitting with my eyes closed and letting myself be washed away in the waves of sound that this band produces my mind is blown and i dont think ill ever quite feel anything like that again ive seen a good amount of bands in my day but i am really struggling to find any show or event in my life that could of compared to this they are more than just a band they are an experience and im so happy i finally got to witness it

1550271 i suspect thats what were going to be faced with

1550487 the material is still not very efficient at converting light to energy but it can be improved
1550488 constantly and vigorously in motion with a subtle sinuous silent throbbing against the air
1550489 the atrocious cannibal tree that had been so inert and dead came to sudden savage life the slender delicate palpi with the fury of starved serpents quivered a moment over her head then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan the tendrils one after another like great green serpents with brutal energy and infernal rapidity rose retracted themselves and wrapped her about in fold after fold ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey
1550490 the great leaves slowly rose and stiffly like the arms of a derrick erected themselves in the air approached one another and closed about the dead and hampered victim with the silent force of a hydraulic press and the ruthless purpose of a thumbscrew
1550491 we yawn when a venus flytrap ensnares a mosquito but shiver with substantial discomfort when a large pitcher plant devours a bird or rodent

1550495 restrictive schedules tangled routings and baggage delays associated with travel aboard the largest international airlines
1550496 the day of the full moon when the moon is neither increasing nor decreasing the babylonians called sa bat meaning heart rest it was believed that on this day the women in the moon ishtar as the moon goddess was known in babylon was menstruating for in babylon as in virtually every ancient and primitive society there had been since the earliest times a taboo against a women working preparing food or traveling when she was passing her monthly blood on sa bat from which comes our sabbath men as well as women were commanded to rest for when the moon menstruated the taboo was on everyone originally and naturally observed once a month the sabbath was later to be incorporated by the christians into their creation myth and made conveniently weekly so nowadays hard minded men with hard muscles and hard hats are relieved from their jobs on sundays because of an archetypal psychological response to menstruation

1550501 in this age of obsessive video sharing and social networking nearly every action is designed and packaged for public consumption especially with young people
1550502 the immed iate charm of nick and his crew is that theyre the exact opposite of all that there is nothing calculated or self conscious about who they are theyre just a group of friends doing some thing to challenge themselves and have some laughs its a story which would have never come from kids who were born here
1550503 what is the connection between ray bradbury and robert pirsig we tend to think of pirsig s novel zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance 1974 as having a title of unique quirky brilliance but it drew for inspiration on a whole corpus of earlier books many of which had been extremely well known and successful robert maynard pirsig they included zen in the art of archery eng trans 1953 by eugen herrigel a german philosophy professor who popularized zen in the west zen in the art of flower arrangement eng trans 1958 by gustie herrigel zen in the art of photography 1969 by robert leverant and several others these are all zen in rather than zen and titles but pirsig was not first in this either since ray bradbury had written an influential and frequently anthologised essay on the craft of fiction zen and the art of writing as long before as 1958
1550504 if youre looking for ferocious detail and cat like grace you cant go wrong with this unique piece of artwork painstakingly handcrafted this bone motorcycle is made from a collection of different bones including a genuine cats skull giving this piece its name measuring just over a foot in length from the front tire to the rear this piece is sure to start a conversation no matter where it is displayed
1550505 one of our most popular pieces the coyote wild chopper takes the idea of the low rider motorcycle to entirely new dimensions this unique piece of bone artwork takes the sleek predatory nature of the coyote skull as its centerpiece and runs full throttle creating a breathtaking puzzle of bone motorcycle and art that simply cant be denied measuring just less than two feet from tip to tail this chopper belongs front and center in any collection

1550517 its obviously a very kind comment by people asked to rank the judges but the idea of rankings is troubling it doesnt indicate the true ranking of the quality of the judges
1550518 not just surveys but really looking at the overall performance of judges
1550519 in terms of the whole survey whats more important is the comments they give you rather than the raw numbers
1550520 really were lucky to be in colorado where theres merit selection and substantive feedback for the judges they look for problems and where they can improve
1550521 colorados judicial performance process tries to strike an extremely difficult balance by making judges accountable to the public without becoming involved in politics

1550533 on the ways of thinking of the people of edo
1550534 more modern than the japan of the first half of the twentieth century
1550535 there are many japans within japan and ishikawas championing of edo and the tenmei literati also represents his counterbalance to the orientalism promoted by officialdom or the concept of a national literature

1550538 on the ways of thinking of the people of edo
1550539 as a prefix in ukiyo e titles the term is suggestive of parody and informality
1550540 derive d from the verb yatsusu meaning to disguise yatsushi refers originally to the act of a highborn person traveling incognito and implies the aristocratic descent into the plebian i e the courtly genji becoming an edo townsman in yatsushi genji legend 253
1550541 means selection and signifies imagery that combines at least two completely different subjects often drawn from the high culture and popular culture respectively for example a scene from classical literature reenacted by fashionably dressed contemporary figures
1550542 the mental armor needed to take up the challenge and argue
1550543 as a parody of chinese tales about taoist immortals in which watashi the narrator rides a bike rather than a cloud
1550544 more likely to propel one headlong down the path to barbarism
1550545 in the process of her transformation the woman in red has discarded the courtliness of speech and classic refinement of romance or the best aspects of japan as it used to be
1550546 used in ukiyo e to describe works in which a classical or other well known theme is cleverly reinterpreted often with a modish twist and in a modern setting

1550553 he had his helmet on he had protective gear but it was a drunk driver that took his life
1550554 this is a brother a husband he left behind a family and he had so many dreams and aspirations
1550555 one drink is too much you dont know who its going to affect
1550556 that he changes his life and that he does it in honor or ernesto de la fuente
1550557 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework
1550558 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1550559 rather than demanding americans inflate their tires obama should be demanding congress return to dc to vote on a real energy plan obama is wrong inflated tires are no substitute for oil drilling and a comprehensive energy plan
1550560 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right where we say things that we dont mean

1550565 as far as congress is concerned we will do our job the senate will be answerable to the people of mindanao
1550566 they dont understand the implications the senate has no constituents in armm this is important as a manifestation of our sincere efforts in the peace process
1550567 wed like to send a message to the milf that they shouldnt get out of the talks because we are accommodating them
1550568 its the message that wed like to show especially from us muslim congressmen
1550569 after our tough weekend at mid ohio i am ready to get to one of my favorite tracks the guys did an outstanding job putting our mopar viper back in pristine shape for this race i have some of the best crew engineers in the industry and i just hope we can wrap our arms around the handling department early in the week it will be important to nail the qualifying setup so we can work on the race setup in practice rather than after we qualify it will be important to have a good result from this race because we have several races very close to this event momentum is key right now in the season

1550572 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1550573 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1550574 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1550575 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1550576 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1550577 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
1550578 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap
1550579 was e mailing me late at night with gobbledygook ranting and raving
1550580 that both of us avoid relapsing into our previous substance abuse
1550581 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1550582 make a u turn make a u turn make a u turn you idiot recalibrating grumble grumble grumble
1550583 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1550584 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1550585 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1550586 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1550587 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security
1550588 the canal should not appear like a swimming pool that people can jump and swim across easily
1550589 so we can come back from denver and get the community fired up to elect obama

1550592 could result in an unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land
1550593 if our nation is serious about regulating greenhouse gases the clean air act is the wrong tool for the job
1550594 its really at the feet of congress to come up with good legislation that cuts through literally decades of regulation and litigation
1550595 transparency in my 27 years at epa i dont recall an administrator doing what i have just done
1550596 as the comments from other cabinet secretaries and administration officials make clear the onerous command and control regulation contemplated in the epa staff draft would impose crippling costs on the economy in the form of a massive hidden tax without even ensuring that the intended overall emissions reductions occur
1550597 esx01 had a full file system due to thousands of core dumps
1550598 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
1550599 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
1550600 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
1550601 im trying to think of all the reasons it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question
1550602 i had not had food or drink so i was thirsty and hungry and i might have been grouchy whats more they were poking needles into me all of the time
1550603 no amount of tinkering with the rule or revising of the explanations will transform cair as written into an acceptable rule
1550604 we are extremely disappointed in the courts decision because its overturning one of the most protective air pollution rules in our nations history well wait and see what our next steps are
1550605 this is probably the biggest air quality setback ever suffered by the epa under any administration
1550606 our air isnt getting any healthier as we battle new clean air regulations in the courts and congress continues to stall in passing strong clean air legislation
1550607 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
1550608 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
1550609 the memos provide further evidence that the office of legal counsel completely distorted the law in order to permit interrogators to use methods that the u s has historically viewed as war crimes
1550610 to shield senior officials from embarrassment accountability and possibly even criminal prosecution
1550611 one of the cias objectives was to deny terrorists insights into a lawful tool that has been used with great success against them
1550612 its absurd for anyone to suggest thats an attempt to avoid accountability
1550613 usaid has decided to conduct an immediate review of all the grants to determine where financial vulnerabilities exist and how best to address these vulnerabilities to strengthen the program for future success
1550614 i received assurances that usaid and the state department are seized with the gravity of the problems in these programs and that they are actively working to correct the problems
1550615 whether this program should be receiving any money at all
1550616 the presidents authority to capture and detain al qaeda agents who like the 9 11 hijackers come to this country to commit or facilitate warlike acts
1550617 presidents most sweeping claims of unchecked and unreviewable executive detention power
1550618 effectively allows the president to seize any person in the united states a citizen or noncitizen and detain them indefinitely without trial
1550619 cripples the most important constitutional right of all the right to be charged and tried if suspected of wrongdoing
1550620 we cannot agree that congress silently authorized a detention power that so vastly exceeds all traditional bounds
1550621 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1550622 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1550623 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1550624 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1550625 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1550626 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1550627 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1550628 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1550629 our nation has come to expect the federal reserve to step in to avert events that pose unacceptable systemic risk
1550630 has neither the clear statutory authority nor the mandate to anticipate and deal with risks across our entire financial system
1550631 we should quickly consider how to appropriately give the fed the authority to access necessary information from highly complex financial institutions and the responsibility to intervene in order to protect the system
1550632 so they can carry out the role our nation has come to expect
1550633 we must limit the perception that some institutions are either too big to fail or too interconnected to fail
1550634 if we are to do that credibly we must address the reality that some are
1550635 this is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoevers going to become president
1550636 i dont care who the president is when they come in and meet with their secretary of the treasury the federal reserve chairman their top economists it will be a sobering moment
1550637 its upward of 500 billion and counting its a mind boggling number
1550638 content to serve as a caretaker for the regime of excessive executive power established by the bush administration
1550639 he wants to make sure that america is in a position where it can protect itself against terrorism that the fbi is making the changes it needs to make
1550640 we cant have an effective agreement unless china and india are a part of it
1550641 its as simple as that im going to remind our partners thats the case
1550642 sustainable development has to be supported by both financial resources and technological resources
1550643 until that happens how do you expect the developing countries to take up quantitative restrictions
1550644 hes willing to change positions break campaign commitments and undermine his own words in his quest for higher office
1550645 senator obama has said before that the compromise bill is not perfect
1550646 given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill and losing important surveillance tools senator obama chose to support the fisa compromise
1550647 its shocking to the conscience in this day and age where the minority populations comprise a significant part of the satellite radio audience that mr martin would settle for what i deem to be crumbs that have fallen off the table
1550648 we can do much better i am hoping that this can be revisited
1550649 were going to close the door and have a very honest and open dialogue about the merger
1550650 if they cannot meet us on any reasonable terms we are going to be very adamant about not approving the merger its not in the public interest they are not concerned about the cost to the consumer
1550651 as ive said from the beginning this merger is a steep climb for me that hasnt changed
1550652 i have not pushed for any conditions that would support a finding that the transaction is in the public interest i look forward to reviewing the chairmans proposal and will consider it with an open mind
1550653 we support what we have heard today about the commissions proposals although we would like to know more about how the set aside for noncommercial channels would be implemented
1550654 given their systematic breaking of virtually every rule set forth by the fcc in their 11 years of existence it would be curious if the commission now rewards xm and sirius with a monopoly
1550655 there is certainly room for disagreement among reasonable people acting in good faith on these questions
1550656 but i still believe we gave the best answers we could on the basis of the legal matters available to us
1550657 so im pretty clear on why im asking you the questions and which one im asking you
1550658 no i wouldnt be responsible is the answer to your question
1550659 this proposal to outsource the core government function of border control at a time that airlines around the world are fighting for their economic survival is both unwarranted and counterproductive
1550660 this uncoordinated and costly mess can no longer be dismissed as simply the cost of doing business
1550661 the implications are so severe they require further consultation reflection and reworking
1550662 at the end of the day controlling our border is a question we have to decide how were going to do that and how carefully
1550663 the continuing cloud of suspicion over the white house is not something i can remove because i know only one part of the story
1550664 only those who know the underlying truth can bring this to an end sadly they remain silent
1550665 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1550666 while we may never know the answers scott mcclellan alone will have to wrestle with whether it was worth selling out the president and his friends for a few pieces of silver
1550667 too often in washington people mistakenly think that loyalty to an individual officeholder should override loyalty to basic ideals
1550668 this false loyalty is not only mistaken but can exercise a corrupt influence on government
1550669 i think scott has probably told everyone everything he doesnt know so i dont know if anyone should expect to see anything new today
1550670 sold the nation on the premise that iraq was a grave and gathering danger
1550671 you can say those things when youre not running for reelection
1550672 on reflection he concluded that it was an inappropriate attempt at humor that he should not have made the vice president apologizes to the people of west virginia for the inappropriate remark
1550673 we talked ugly to them last night and this morning and they came back and responded today
1550674 the film doesnt lie and i thought that the guys did an outstanding job of catching passes today
1550675 tomorrow were going to come out in shoulder pads and have a little bit more physical practice
1550676 tyrone nix was mixing in a lot of different blitzes today and they have a lot of speed on the defensive side of the ball
1550677 tyrone jumped on us real good yesterday and caused a lot of confusion which is why we had picks interceptions and turnovers today we didnt have that and that was a positive
1550678 josh shene is still doing well and our deep snapping is solid but we have to get our punters to be more consistent and quicker when getting the ball off they were much better today than yesterday
1550679 i thought senator clinton after a long fought campaign was understandably focused on her supporters
1550680 i just spoke to her today and we are going to be having a conversation in the coming weeks
1550681 the laws and constitution are designed to survive and remain in force in extraordinary times
1550682 the nation will live to regret what the court has done today
1550683 senator barack obama with the democratic stage to himself for the first time began a two week assault on senator john mccains economic policies in a series of battleground states on monday moving to define the general election campaign by focusing on the economy as the central theme
1550684 this information indicates that the bush administration may have systematically implemented from the top down detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law
1550685 because these apparent enhanced interrogation techniques were used under cover of justice department legal opinions the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious
1550686 the department reviews every letter received by congress and responds appropriately
1550687 despite the seriousness of the evidence the justice department has brought prosecution against only one civilian for an interrogation related crime
1550688 given that record we believe it is necessary to appoint a special counsel in order to ensure that a thorough and impartial investigation occurs
1550689 how do i change the behavior of the user account control message
1550690 he is puzzled and he doesnt recognize this as the scott mcclellan that he hired and confided in and worked with for so many years
1550691 disappointed that if he had these concerns and these thoughts he never came to him or anyone else on the staff
1550692 misguided for him to make these kind of broad accusations and draw these big conclusions about the president
1550693 thats one of the reasons this book comes as such a shock
1550694 it comes from the last person that anyone would have thought would have said these things or written these things all you can do is scratch your head when you see how far hes turned
1550695 tomorrow maybe were going to learn hes rooting for the oklahoma sooners
1550696 heres a man who owes his whole career to george w bush and here hes stabbing him in the back and no one knows why
1550697 he appears to be dancing on his political grave for cash
1550698 my friends and former colleagues who lived and worked or are still living and working inside that bubble may not be happy with the perspective i present here
1550699 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1550700 why all of a sudden if he had all these grave concerns did he not raise these sooner

1550703 there is no evidence to suggest the type of music you listen to will cause you to commit suicide but those who are vulnerable and at risk of committing suicide may be listening to certain types of music

1550726 public indecency lewd act with a minor scaring the horses
1550727 it burned out thousands of years ago but we still see its light
1550728 and that light will burn for thousands and thousands of years and when i look into the sky ill see it

1550730 its human nature to seek love and i wouldnt deny you that i would never want to see you lonely

1550734 rose we ought to get back to the tardis spring showers typically last a few hours here once they start dont think they were expecting them for today though
1550735 you said alien monster you insinuated huge teeth and claws and the like
1550736 tosh i thought the scanners said at least 8 feet
1550737 am i the only one whos glad its small enough to fit in a milk pitcher and not in need of a whale tank
1550738 it might be the size of a tennis ball but its just gotten a rift ride and isnt sure where it is itll be defensive and probably try and do damage
1550739 why dont we put some goldfish in the tank and see if vaughnll hunt them i bet hell tear them to shreds
1550740 or even a turtle those small ones itll be a live action aquatic battle
1550741 were still running a defense operation here not a pet store back to work
1550742 any more of this and owens going to get his darwinism show between these two
1550743 theres gotta be a way to train her to not be jealous right
1550744 ill start a search on a dinosaur whisperer as soon as im done with the feeding
1550745 at least im not planning on teaching the pterodactyl how to give us rides once tea boy gets around to ordering the harness
1550746 whatever happened with that order you said itd be here last week
1550747 the make it up as you go along insouciance that characterizes so many variants of postmodernism
1550748 oh y ou tell me what the hell im refering to
1550749 oh i forgot tom got called away on an emergency assignment there was a horrible storm in the pacific three months ago and they needed doctors martha volunteered and they got married there just a week ago she e mailed gwen and i that she was expecting a baby you know this is just so awful
1550750 i dont know why youre here but im glad youre here you can keep me from doing something stupid like shooting that officious prick over there
1550751 i know as the perpetrators are human and on foreign soil torchwood has no jurisdiction but i dont need to hear this now
1550752 tom and martha were in the pacific when an entire team of medical personnel on a nearby island was wiped out by a band of rebels
1550753 tom and martha because they are tom and martha offered to replace them as there was a great need for trained medical people in that area they and about twenty patients all women and children were taken hostage four days ago by this cult or rebel group led by some fourteen year old boy who thinks hes the second coming they dont think there is a soldier in the group over twenty five except for the boys father
1550754 but the burmese government insists that they handle this situation with no outside interference
1550755 neither the un or the british government can do anything officially to help doctors jones and milligan
1550756 there is reason to believe we may not have much time to act the children of the red sun have released a video through the internet we were able to intercept it before the news service broadcasted it and the bbc agreed to do a remote feed to this residence i i am sorry this will be extremely disturbing and there is no way to prepare you but if you find the video unbearable we can dispense with it and give you the written report
1550757 is he mad of course he is what am i saying but martha didnt do anything
1550758 i think not there is nothing to forgive and someone needs to cry because i find that i cannot i feel too much rage
1550759 did she tell you that when we first met i kissed her
1550760 no she wouldnt tell me that she knew i didnt like you
1550761 i told her it was nothing a dna transfer necessary to save our lives
1550762 youre not going to insult my daughters memory by telling me that that kiss meant
1550763 it was a dna transfer to help us and martha acted with me to save so many lives then and so many times
1550764 why did you tell me about this meant nothing kiss
1550765 it was a proper kiss you see i could have gotten away with a hug or licked her finger
1550766 but she was so brave and so beautiful and trusting in that moment i felt very much just a man taking the chance to kiss a pretty woman before he dashes off to battle i had not felt that way since since i was a young man on my home planet
1550767 me judge humans do you remember our days on the valiant at the mercy of a man of my species
1550768 but im no good at the in sickness and health bit even with friends im good at a crisis but im just not strong enough to watch you all of you fade
1550769 we all feel the need to escape i wish to heaven i could escape the facing life without my girl
1550770 good journey doctor i hope one day youll stop running
1550771 i go away for a month and what do i find in the library
1550772 who is martha and what exactly is that you are supposed to know what to do
1550773 doctor martha jones she used to travel with me i turned this off eighty five years ago
1550774 his parents and he were separated when during a hurricane
1550775 it was horrible from everything my grandfather told me they cut off her hands so she couldnt doctor any more she was pregnant and she was tortured even after they let the others go the government couldnt do anything without starting a war her friends from this organization called torchwood have you heard of it doctor
1550776 im positive whatever the message is it was not a call for help
1550777 i would be more than happy to pick up curry from the indian palace on my way to the imperial gardens
1550778 no matter what when you ask him what he wants he wont tell you
1550779 never made much of a fuss over it its just another day really
1550780 ive left strict orders with the team not to disturb us
1550781 now that doesnt sound like something id normally say does it
1550782 should i put on a suit or is this something thats likely to get messy
1550783 he died when i was seven but he he understood me
1550784 insomnia huh so those nights you keep me company its not just because you cant resist my many charms

1550787 whats your idea of a perfect start to the day
1550788 having enough coffee to keep you lot satisfied not finding pterodactyl crap on any surface and kissing you at least a dozen times before the others arrive
1550789 but i was thinking something in the line of breakfast

1550794 come on time and tide waits for no man well except for me
1550795 i dont c consider that a w waste of time jack
1550796 history making that its pr probably the most in inappro priate thing ever done at a historic site

1550798 today is my day and i decree no sad thoughts
1550799 maybe if you ever get your vortex manipulator to working again you can come back and visit me whenever you want

1550808 he was such a serious boy so determined to make his father proud of him to finally do something that would make his father notice him
1550809 geraint never got over the loss of iantos mother he withdrew from life after that
1550810 so much heartache for such a young person to bear
1550811 i was just telling carole about my birthday and my wanting a special portrait to commemorate it
1550812 if he hasnt gotten the perfect shot with a stunning subject like you the man should change his line of work

1550814 i really should arrange for them to deliver to the hub tomorrow
1550815 gwen was complaining we never have anything other than pizza for lunch
1550816 do you really want to hear gwen whinge everyday about the effects of pizza on her figure
1550817 but i meant you dont have to get our lunch or run our errands ianto youre too valuable to still be cleaning up after us i can get someone to do those things to clear away the trash and run the tourist office
1550818 you do too much i mean you get us everywhere on time keep the records organize the archives clean up after us and then you take care of me

1550839 we have 40 years of forest service history that has been reversed in the last three months
1550840 now that plum creek is getting out of the timber business were kind of missing the loggers
1550841 a clear cut will grow back but a subdivision of trophy homes thats going to be that way forever
1550842 its kind of the ugly face of the new economy
1550843 for us this is kind of an arterial bleed and were either going to get a handle on it or not
1550844 weve learned a lot about the reality of being homeless and the need to break the homelessness cycle in brisbane i am pleased that gadens staff have had the opportunity to be involved in a very hands on practical sense and make a difference to those in need
1550845 the experience of homelessness causes many families to lose the confidence in being able to maintain a safe stable lifestyle by providing them with a range of simple essentials they have a better chance to establish a home which is so important in creating stability
1550846 since her dress was very bohemian we wanted her hair to be a little edgier but still complement her look

1550851 at the end of a hard day its great to just listen to with a beer or a glass of red it has that mystical ability to somehow transport you off to another place another time

1550853 we were able to image dark energy in action as it stretches huge supervoids and superclusters of galaxies
1550854 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
1550855 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
1550856 dark energy sort of gives microwaves a memory of where theyve been recently
1550857 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them
1550858 i believe this is the first time someone has resorted to texting
1550859 it is good and good to remind people that when a signal is too weak for voice communication you may still be able to communicate by text
1550860 when an engine is working of course its spinning the propeller at high speed and theres a lot of force behind the propeller so when it contacts trees on the ground the propeller and the trees will demonstrate how forceful that propeller strike is
1550861 a lot of it is consumed by fire and but there is significant components the engines propellers etcetera that we will be able to examine
1550862 this type of aircraft has a well documented reliable history we know the rcmp used to use this type of aircraft for a number of years and so did macmillan bloedel
1550863 all of these aircraft have to be maintained as though theyre brand new
1550864 these guys do this type of flying because they absolutely love aviation and they love this type of work
1550865 everybodys in shock its a great loss a range of emotions you know theyre all over the map
1550866 theyre just in a grieving period right now its a pretty small tight knit group of fellas theyve known each other for a number of years so were just allowing that to happen
1550867 were on stand down right now no one from that division is essentially working were not moving logs or participating at all
1550868 obviously everyone is pretty shaken up for a lot of our employees you know they were away for the long weekend and so a lot of them are just coming back in today and learning the news
1550869 its a huge loss for the sport and for his friends and family
1550870 he often told me that when he had to quit which he was thinking of retiring this year he just had no idea what he would do he spent the better part of 50 years with horses he was a true traditional cowboy he just loved the sport of chuckwagon racing like nobody else
1550871 he was still competitive and could still show the young boys a thing or two
1550872 so in march 2007 the company revamped development so that members of all three groups would work on the same team following a project from start to finish and making changes as needed with customers programmers and testers working virtually side by side avocent tripled production without adding workers
1550873 most companies erroneously focus on competition and on differentiation from their competitors

1550875 were going to now have 4 policies that will engender a set of rules that will change the governance of the mainland that we all will participate in and by which we will be bound as our obligation to you 1 clearly defined and tos actionable zoning that we will enforce 2 a complete end to ad farming by banning the sale of any land under 512 except for 0 as one possible solution banning extortionist prices to buy back the view and banning intrusive and disruptive ad towers that disturb the peace or spam 3 maintenance of governor linden land with repaired roads autoreturn less ugly planting etc
1550876 we are going to intervene more on the mainland and treat the mainland not as your land that you can develop under a rule of law we are obliged to maintain but as our personal estate where to keep you as tenants we need to create better conditions
1550877 to echo mitch kapors recent speech at the second life birthday event as our audience widens we have to take a more active part in guiding their experience
1550878 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1550897 it snows a lot here have you ever been to the west coast
1550898 yeah but only for like twelve minutes at a time i found twelve minutes to be such a random period of time to put out there i just feel that the east coast is like a crazy tim burton dream with trash everywhere like i picture a dark batman movie when i think of boston and new york

1550903 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1550904 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1550905 theyve got a lot to do theyve got to show us a verification regime that we can trust
1550906 this is a step by step process i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1550907 of course behind those people there were those people who were sort of opposed but their numbers were limited
1550908 ours is a vital relationship and our three meetings will only strengthen the relationship i admire your forthrightness your integrity
1550909 it will help lift the korean economy up a level president bush and i promised to do our best to get it passed within this year
1550910 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1550911 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1550912 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
1550913 i am one thousand per cent sure that the elements involved in target killings and subversive activities are being financed and trained by foreign elements who do not want peace in the country
1550914 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1550915 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1550916 once they got started i think they just could not turn off the machine
1550917 the washington post reports on the booming business of selling your medical treatment records today these are mainly records of your prescriptions but the data warehouses will soon have records of your lab tests too the companies selling these records make it easy for insurance companies to avoid risk by assigning each person a health score similar to a credit score or by flagging items in each persons history that suggest chronic or potentially expensive health problems its not just for insurers either employers who check applicants credit scores will surely be interested in their health scores as well
1550918 i told you so rather than shot at providing a real solution
1550919 what gives is the blogosphere some sort of 5th grade playground where we need to impress each other with how cool we can be by throwing in the f word every few paragraphs
1550920 cursing bad what if their kids see it later then what yeah thatll show em
1550921 gawd i want to board a rocketship and get the hell out of here now
1550922 what were trying to do is enhance police and community partnerships and this is one of the best ways to do it
1550923 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1550924 the strange hannys voorwerp as it is also known looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar

1550928 pai got rich at enron and a bunch of people lost money when enron went down in flames so he must have done something criminal and must be punished

1550932 nadie pensaba que un cat lico pod a presidir lleg kennedy y lo hizo
1550933 tengo una relaci n muy buena con el matrimonio y por eso apoy a hillary que me parec a una candidata excelente
1550934 pero precisamente se fue el problema que condujo a la derrota era la candidata perfecta inevitable la favorita no pod a perder as que el equipo se confi y no se dio cuenta de lo que se avecinaba est bamos muy preparados para las elecciones generales pero no para las primarias y subestimamos el potencial y carisma de obama
1550935 cuando empezamos a ver lo que ocurr a lo negamos
1550936 pensamos que era cosa de un d a no entendimos que la sociedad estaba sedienta ansiosa de un cambio radical hillary hablaba de un cambio en relaci n a los republicanos pero la sociedad quer a m s no a un pol tico al uso y los medios de comunicaci n se enamoraron de obama mientras nosotros intent bamos improvisar un plan b que no exist a
1550937 a m me gustar a que hillary lo acompa ara como vicepresidenta pero no va a ser as y no por lo duras que han sido las primarias ahora mismo no es importante si se llevan bien o mal sino qui n le va a ayudar a ganar las elecciones eso es lo nico que cuenta

1550954 indianapolis urban forest is uniquely diverse with only one of over 170 species representing slightly more than 10 percent of the total tree population
1550955 this diversity is important because it puts the forest at less risk of catastrophic losses from disease or pests
1550956 70 percent of americans are in favor of exploring for offshore oil but new congressman don cazayoux has opposed efforts to increase domestic energy production 10 times no wonder hes endorsed by a liberal special interest group that favors high gas prices
1550957 two years ago the democrats said they had a plan to lower gas prices but nothings been done
1550958 and cazayoux instead of staying in washington to fix the problem he was the deciding vote to send the house on a five week recess in washington cazayoux was beholden to nancy pelosi and the liberal dc special interests but when he goes back home he sings a different tune
1550959 life may not be the party we hoped for but while were here we should dance

1550964 they wanted to go down and see the buildings out of curiosity
1550965 they decided to break into the buildings and then they went from there
1550966 the public is outraged when people do these acts of vandalism
1550967 the massillon fire department and the massillon police department will spend many hours looking into this these crimes they will be looked into diligently and to the fullest extent of the law they will be prosecuted
1550968 there were drug pushers hanging out there there were no baseball fields no basketball courts it wasnt safe
1550969 we received some seed money to start on the project from the mens fellowship group at st james ame zion church
1550970 altogether we received somewhere between 150 000 to 200 000 from city and other organizations
1550971 the walnut hills resident association asked if we would be interested in holding a camp
1550972 they said they had a dream of doing something like this and we had plans of doing this type of event
1550973 there were other coaches that came in throughout the week too they coordinated the fundamental skill drills
1550974 because we wanted her to see how great the park looks now it is something that her husband would be proud of
1550975 i feel safe the people are so warm and friendly
1550976 its a huge turnaround it is exciting to see some events that help the community realize that it is very changed
1550977 the reputation does not represent how walnut hills is now the association has done a great job to make sure that walnut hills has a safe healthy environment they have made huge strides im so impressed
1550978 theyre both very similar so offensively our system doesnt change because of the needs of the quarterback
1550979 theyre both athletes they both can throw and run the ball its not a changing of philosophy with either two so were definitely happy about that
1550980 hes being a leader hes really improved defensively and offensively like i said it wouldnt be too crazy to see michael clark playing corner wideout and quarterback throughout any week its just a situation where hes a great athlete and no matter what the situation is hes going to be on the field
1550981 i think theyre both getting in there and demanding it a lots been thrown at them with the new system and i think theyre doing well one thing i can say is that were getting better every day
1550982 i would say well have a good understanding of which direction were going to go as far as that after the first scrimmage
1550983 well know who will take priority reps and who will take the secondary reps the good thing for both of them is that theyre both great athletes and can play anywhere on the field so were going to be smart but at the same time were going to put our team in the best chance to be successful
1550984 he is a true leader there is no doubt about that
1550985 we were looking for the best candidate for the community and for the department
1550986 we were very considerate during this process that started in april we werent messing around we were very serious about this and we believe weve found the best person
1550987 for me the first three or four months ill be mainly listening to what they have to say
1550988 well put together a needs analysis and put a strategic plan in place theyll be doing it ill help out and help them get any resources they need well put together a plan for five years down the road for perry township and how we can meet the needs of the public
1550989 all three of them had to stand up in front of the kiosk where the five fire chiefs were sitting and they had to answer a set of questions
1550990 the chiefs fired off the same 15 questions to all of them each candidate had to respond on the spot there were questions about the community technical questions and questions about the administrative aspect he did fantastically
1550991 the one thing ive learned around here is that our kids can handle any situation theres always a lot of people trying to watch practice theres always something going on in the community thats what makes it special handling a little five minute break because something happened down in the kitchen or someplace isnt going to affect us too much
1550992 it would probably be determined on monday or tuesday i dont know the status a week ago they said it was going to be at their place right now were ready the busses are ordered to go down there at this time the junior varsity will start at 6 oclock
1550993 my shoulders are getting broad and high so i have to make up for that by using my body by moving my shoulders more
1550994 they are men portraying women through a filter its not real
1550995 add to that taichi saotomes youth and you get a fantasy like beauty
1550996 its finally here all these camp days and then you have all these acclimation days before we really get into two a days
1550997 the kids are excited about it though with it being the first day they can hit were excited to see what some of our kids can do and go from there
1550998 a lot of kids might look great when theres no contact and no pads on but once you can start hitting it shows you a lot
1550999 it might show you who has a little bit more courage than someone else but our kids have never shied away from hitting thats for sure hopefully in this first full week we can get some questions answered and some kids will step up and do what we want them to do
1551000 we have some good ideas now but obviously we want to make sure we get the right people in the right places
1551001 we want to make sure the right people should be playing thats the great thing about competition it just makes you work harder we have some ideas going in but well evaluate the film and bring the kids in and show them all the good things and im sure some of the bad things that happened it should be a great scrimmage
1551002 i dont know that its so much because its massillon more so than its just a chance to hit someone in a different colored jersey
1551003 the kids on both teams on both sides of the ball want to go out and do the best they can
1551004 no life does not owe you a career in libraries
1551005 i came in and got a 5 000 signing bonus
1551006 i was blessed to have that hey im on the browns team i remember how it was back in 2005 im too blessed to be stressed
1551007 but not playing for the cleveland browns i dont regret that
1551008 anything that goes on off the field im sure my agent will handle and the browns you know will put me in a better situation so we can win football games
1551009 shaffer is talking to the browns management every day and something will happen if it doesnt i will be out here still playing football for the browns
1551010 i have all devotion to the football team to this organization to the fans my loyalty is to the football team
1551011 with a guy like cribbs you never know when that big play is gonna come
1551012 hes almost like that 12th man on offense you know in a game youre gonna get a touchdown from him on a punt return or a kickoff return or youre gonna get something
1551013 hes gonna bring his hardhat work hard in practice and play hard every game
1551014 hes an excellent production guy for us in several different phases primarily on special teams we have a package for him on offense he helps us win we definitely want him on the team
1551015 he is under contract his job is to play football if theres an issue his people will talk to our people and see what they can get worked out
1551016 phil and i talk about whats best for the browns whats best for the browns is what we do
1551017 it is interesting that a large proportion of those who took part in our survey dont appear to be taking drastic measures with their finances just yet however our figures do reveal that families are being affected more than most by rising costs

1551038 police have to meet their quotas so they arrest idus injecting drug users and throw them behind bars they are forced into cold turkey without any kind of help some are even randomly killed and these cases are not investigated
1551039 they are stigmatized and not accepted as humans police shave their heads and make them run around their villages to humiliate them they are not given hiv drugs because people think they cant adhere to treatment
1551040 but idus are the only high risk group in thailand experiencing no reduction in hiv prevalence in 20 years and they make up 25 percent of all new infections they must be given hiv drugs
1551041 with drug users its the stigma the criminalization and legal policies that inhibit the implementation of these programs criminalization and law enforcement have taken over harm reduction
1551042 the mermaid jingle jam contest is our way of inviting consumers to become a part of chicken of the sea

1551046 i think his paranoia is getting to him ive got no knowledge of where the tape came from

1551048 it was quite obvious a dissaffected former staffer at nz first was giving information about what was said and done in and around the office
1551049 upon his return from egypt bonaparte was very thin and sallow skinned he had a coppery complexion rather deep set eyes perfectly shaped limbs though somewhat emaciated then his forehead was very high he did not have much hair especially on the temples but it was fine and very soft it was brown and his eyes were a handsome blue and reflected incredibly well his various emotions sometimes extremely gentle and caressing sometimes severe and even harsh his mouth was very handsome he had fine lips a bit tight especially when he was in a bad mood his teeth without being set with great regularity were very white and sound they never gave him any trouble his nose greek in shape was perfect and his sense of smell extremely acute in sum his whole figure reflected a regular handsomeness however at that time his extreme thinness prevented one from seeing that beauty of his features and the resulting effect was not a pleasant one his head was very large a little flattened on the temples his ears were small perfectly shaped his height was five feet two inches three lines his neck was a bit short his shoulders not prominent his chest wide with very little hair his hands admirable with fingernails to match so he paid the utmost attention to them as to the rest of his person but without any foppishness he would often bite his nails but lightly it was a sign of impatience or preoccupation
1551050 it really shows the partnership and the fact that we have to work together to make birmingham safer
1551051 the level of improvement in any community is really dependent on the commitment of the neighbor
1551052 in neighborhoods where the people are really committed and dedicated to making it safer they have drastic improvements because they send the message that were not going to tolerate crime in our community
1551053 if they dont trust you or if they dont have some personal interest or stake in calling you they wont

1551057 ive asked the questions no we havent seen him thats the hardest part
1551058 i dont want to believe nothing else i just want my son
1551059 i see it all the time kids missing and i could never imagine how a parent feels im one of those parents now and it hurts it hurts
1551060 whether their reason is proper or improper theyve gotta have a reason for doing that i want to find out what it is
1551061 i have not seen anything that leads me to believe the tda is opposed to the wilkins development
1551062 we dont have to call them weve never called them in the past
1551063 this thing just seems to be surrounded by secrecy and its been very disturbing
1551064 burt ive gotta be careful because i have only heard one side but from what i heard today it sure looks like something fishy is going on
1551065 a person who has had a long standing involvement in the national party
1551066 the dominion post reported yesterday the party received multiple donations from the vela familys fishing and thoroughbred companies between 1999 and 2003 all made out for amounts under 10 000
1551067 donations of more than 10 000 or multiple donations of smaller amounts from the same company or person in one year have to be declared and nz first does not appear to have done that
1551068 winston says that donations by wealthy racing industry families did not affect nz firsts racing policy i actually believe him on this i generally have a firm view that money follows policies not policies follow money unions donate money to labour because they like their policies labour doesnt design policies just to attract donations from unions but here is winstons problem he has spent over 15 years alleging that policies do follow money that mps are venal and corrupt and will sell favours to donors so if people see something wrong with the velas donating to nz first it is because of the climate that winston and others have created
1551069 peters has always set his party up as whiter than white and holier than thou on campaign donations
1551070 peters has not denied that the velas made donations he is under no obligation to reveal every legal donation to his party peters has stated he will sue the dompost for defamation over its unevidenced allegations that he took party donations for his personal use national refuses to rule out having peters in a national led government based on the information available they are calling on the government to sack him on the available information national wants the pm to investigate the internal finances of another party but refuses to open its own books
1551071 nationals leader john key said it appeared some of the reported 150 000 in donations from the vela family had not made it into nz firsts accounts
1551072 he wanted to know what miss clark was going to do to
1551073 but today mr key said on radio new zealand that until there was strong evidence to the contrary he would have to take mr peters at his word
1551074 winston peters explanation for the owen glenn donations affair is exquisite it means everyone is right
1551075 when winston peters held up the big no sign in february in response to questions about whether glenn had donated money winstons lawyer brian henry didnt pick up the phone either before and after and say arrrrhhhh winston he flicked us 100k 18 months ago
1551076 there is grim comedy to be found everywhere in the winston peters donation row theres peters himself of course gamely insisting he has no case to answer and he knew nothing until friday night and that its still the medias fault theres national mindful that it might actually need winston peters especially as its huge poll lead starts to shorten up a little and thus trying to find someone from the labour party it can blame theres labour spending the weekend behaving like its never even heard of this peters guy theres rodney hide loving it
1551077 as far as i can tell from the ministry paper the costs are
1551078 a universal student allowance of 350 isnt going to happen its too expensive and would bar major new spending in any other area but more relief from debt would be welcome
1551079 whats not good to see is how quickly theyre trying to in an election campaign where theyre struggling to win a fourth term labour desperately needs to give people a reason to support them it can only do this by showing us a clear left wing vision and going places national can not and will not go on workers rights equality and social services if they cant or wont do that then they have only themselves to blame when they lose the upfront cost is 2 billion over four years which would make it a hefty policy indeed however much of that money is spent anyway at least on a cashflow basis through the student loan scheme and once this is accounted for the cost shrinks to 728 million or about 180 million per year
1551080 of course none of this would be an issue if labour hadnt cut taxes and on this front i cant help but notice that the 180 million a year cost of a reuniversalised student allowance is only slightly less than the 184 million a year the rich gain due to labours
1551081 during the campaign joyce denied any knowledge of the brethrens campaign but emails leaked to hager that appear in his book show joyce was closely involved
1551082 steven will be a very popular choice he played a key role in the 2005 campaign which lifted nationals vote by 18 or so and is an incredibly capable and talented individual he is also the chair of the 2008 campaign committee so this gives him an incentive to get a really good result
1551083 its a shame that helen clark doesnt do much about it when she wakes up the video says that labour is against poverty against waste against pollution against excess thats certainly true of its rhetoric but so far its actions have been pro climate change pro excessive motorway projects pro wasteful deforestation pro polluting our waterways and at times pro leaving behind the children of beneficiaries as it tries to shore up its mainstream vote im inclined to put together a video of edited highlights of helen and john key agreeing on well most anything but i dont think i could keep it to just 44 seconds like 08wire did for jeanette and helen
1551084 the september 11 attacks were used as cover to pass draconian laws around the world particularly concerning immigration the government is once again following suit with the new

1551103 though it was shot the track may go missing from the episode
1551104 these are half baked facts and will only complicate matters all of us had a great time on the sets and we shot for 12 hours all the songs from the film were played
1551105 we are finding it difficult to track the user who allegedly misused haywoods wi fi for sending the threat e mail we are putting our best efforts to solve the case and will be seeking technical expertise from the cyber experts associated with purdue university who are globally known for solving such hacked messages
1551106 we have not submitted any report to the anti terrorism squad ats as yet
1551107 indian mujahideen had sent threats via e mails from cyber cafes even after the blasts in jaipur and lucknow
1551108 earlier such terror mails were anonymously sent from cyber cafes but cyber cafes are now asking people to identify themselves and there is no anonymity left terrorists are now using unsecured wi fi networks tracking them is getting increasingly difficult
1551109 motorists are intimidated by the sheer size and noise of trucks and a perception theyre unsafe trucks are certainly less manoeuvrable and responsive than cars motorists are also concerned about the increasing number of larger freight carrying trucks on the road trucks must pay their fair share of the costs for using the nations roads including the damage caused by heavy vehicles

1551111 taranaki mp shane ardern was reported yesterday in his local newspaper the te awamutu courier as suggesting the employer contribution needed to be adjusted to reduce pressure on small business owners national party sources said there were no plans to introduce a two tier system big and small employers would be required to pay the same amount mr ardern had no idea what was in the policy they said it was known only to leader john key and his deputy bill english
1551112 but the assurance came only after national earlier refused to confirm or deny mr arderns statement and mr ardern claimed to have been misquoted
1551113 on sunday bill english let slip that national still intends to of employees of small businesses for the first 90 days of employment now nationals shane ardern has spilled the beans on the nats policy to cut the contributions to hundreds of thousands of kiwis kiwisaver plans are kiwisavers thousands are signing up each day over 22 of kiwis work in businesses with fewer than 20 employees thats 160 000 kiwis so far who would lose employer contributions to kiwisaver under nationals policy
1551114 whatever the questions about the precise details of nationals position on kiwisaver and
1551115 taranaki mp shane ardern was reported yesterday in his local newspaper the te awam
1551116 the standard reported this is the same team which did the keepleftnz site in 2005 in other words it is probably also run out of the pms office the site even makes it clear that the material appearing on the site is contributed by multiple persons it is not an individual effort in an ultimate fit of hypocrisy they have registered the site in the org top level domain as this allows anonymous domain name registrants they also claim to be exempt from the electoral finance act as it is hosted overseas and managed by a nzers who lives overseas their lack of transparency clearly breaches the spirit of the electoral finance act and quite possibly also the statute itself i will be lodging official complaints over the site and asking electoral authorities to fully investigate it

1551120 a quick look at the site shows it to have professionally edited graphics and obviously considerable resource behind it
1551121 the nz political blogosphere is abuzz with the recent arrival of 08wire
1551122 the issue is not so much the 7 5 increase per se but the fact it was imposed with no warning period
1551123 so lets get this straight the government has increased road user charges for diesel vehicles by half the amount recommended by the ministry of transport to cover the roading costs of those vehicles the increase is 7 8 road user chargers account for 10 of trucking costs so were talking a less than in trucking costs about 198 a year for a 23 tonne truck every cent of which will be used for building our transport infrastructure give me a break the road user charges are just the excuse the protest is the objective tony friedlander head of the road transport forum former national minister secret major national donor and star of the hollow men is behind the protest he told transport minister annette king the protest would be happening weeks ago before the road user charge changes were announced
1551124 national attacked the government yesterday over increased road user charges and a law passed last night allowing regional fuel taxes to fund large capital projects but wont say it would undo them
1551125 how on earth can you justify putting more costs on to the poor old motorists already suffering from very high petrol prices and on the trucking industry

1551127 a furious mr peters yesterday stood by his categoric denial in february that he had ever received money from mr glenn and labelled reports calling those denials into question
1551128 there has to be an explanation as to why mr peters would say publicly that expat billionaire owen glenn had not given to the new zealand first party when emails from mr glenn to his pr man in auckland say that he had given a donation to new zealand first prime minister helen clark has every reason to treat mr peters differently from the high standards she set for sacked minister lianne dalziel and david benson pope mr peters party keeps her minority government in power national has every reason to run a middle course to put the pressure on helen clark to demand the truth without offending peters so much that he eschews the party if it needs him to form the government
1551129 we still do not know if owen glenn did donate to nz first the only way it can be resolved is an independent investigation but if he did donate why did he donate would he have donated if he did if winston was not foreign minister that is why it is an issue for the prime minister
1551130 so what now peters was talking in his capacity as leader of new zealand first not foreign minister and while he may have lied to the media he didnt mislead parliament that means calls for him to be sacked as foreign minister are just politicking by opportunists if peters has lied to the public as new zealand firsts leader then it is for his party and the voters to punish him and voters should punish him as they should punish any politician who lies to their faces
1551131 auckland was worst hit with 2000 trucks rolling in from the north and south to converge on the city in christchurch early morning commuters reported normal trips to work but by 9 30am christchurchs central city was choked in parts
1551132 yes transport minister annette king had agreed to one month notice of any increase in road user charges but had not said when it would come into force
1551133 the broadcasting policy that national will take to the 2008 election paves the way for new diversity on free to air television with free to air broadcasters and independent producers being invited to contest charter funding that is currently directly allocated to tvnz with virtually no questions asked
1551134 under a national government that 15 million will be allocated by new zealand on air which will invite all free to air channels and independent producers to pitch for state investment in their projects
1551135 now to be fair the broadcasting policy is more of a policy ette running to all of one and a half pages but the main points are covered national has taken what i think is a relatively brave step and announced it will end the governments experiment with tvnz as both a public service broadcaster and a commercial cash cow z and pacific access radio at current levels support maori tv and the new freeview platform and switch off analogue in 2015 much of this is simply status quo the major change is scrapping the charter
1551136 what national wants to do is to allow that money to go into a contestable pool for all free to air broadcasters to bid for this fits nationals general philosophy of allowing competition in state monopolies and thats fine the public can decide whether it agrees the question i have for national though is what happens to tvnz in the long run is there any reason to keep it as a state broadcaster if its public service funding and therefore obligations are removed coleman has declared national wont sell tvnz it cant anyway un der the deed of its no state asset sales in our first term policy but if the broadcaster is to be allowed to return to simply making money the question will come up as to why it is necessary to own it at all
1551137 let us look at his claim there is no point in having tvnz owned by the state without the charter well apart from the 30 or so years it was happily state owned with no charter
1551138 no matter what the policy is labour will call it privatisation
1551139 tomorrows generation is developing with the older generation that creates stars
1551140 wambach helped them so much on the road to the olympics she played a significant part in that now shes broken her leg and we change again weve talked about change from the beginning
1551141 first were concentrating on the three games in the olympics second we played against that style
1551142 the upcoming by election is not just about a seat it is about putting anwar in his rightful place
1551143 listened to what every bitch in new york said about her she would never leave the house
1551144 prime minister helen clark has called for the black caps to cancel their tour of zimbabwe next july
1551145 obviously we would prefer the black caps not play in zimbabwe
1551146 so the question would be whether the ground has changed sufficiently at the icc that would have to be explored obviously we would prefer that the black caps not play in zimbabwe we made that clear last time
1551147 first we should support the english efforts to stop zimbabwe playing in the twenty20 tournament next june the england and wales cricket board is taking the lead in this
1551148 the board has already cancelled zimbabwes cricket tour of britain next may after british prime minister gordon brown expressed his objection
1551149 i am appealing to new zealand cricket to stand squarely behind the england and wales board in this matter at the international cricket council annual conference this week our government should back new zealand cricket in taking such a strong stand
1551150 this is the least we can do to help the suffering people of zimbabwe
1551151 economic uncertainty is nationals latest rationale for why theyre positions and costings until the election campaign has virtually begun off hand it is hard to think of a serious pretender to government in any other modern democracy that could get away with concealing the nature and cost of their policies for so long merely because it suits them tactically to do so
1551152 key has not been disclosing an important secret about his leadership that each step of his campaign to become prime minister has been overseen and directed by the same professional manipulators used and also kept secret by his predecessor don brash
1551153 crosby textor was hired to create the image of brand key that we now hear repeated mindlessly in the media hes a nice guy hes a consensus builder and make brand key the entire basis of debate on nationals re election campaign back in november 2006
1551154 key can take on all the message discipline the experts can provide it will likely win him the election

1551158 details in yesterdays article were relatively scarce but there is enough there times and dates of meetings with the pollsters to indicate that hager has specific information rather than just hearsay reports it is also hagers style to drip feed information and wait for official denials before trumping his target with hard facts national should still be afraid very afraid there are some uncanny parallels emerging with 2005 and 2002 involving hager say what you like about the conclusions he draws his facts are almost always correct hager is merticulous about checking his sources so if he still has access to nationals emails this is a massive problem the question national will be privately asking now is whats next this assumes of course that hager has more im betting he does
1551159 a refuse to engage look for another c t line that he will repeat in every interview something along the lines of no look the real issue here is why helen clark is so obsessed with who i get advice from when hardworking kiwis are suffering from 9 years of overtaxation

1551162 the importance of the six books in hadith has been exagerated in western scholarship as well as among modernist muslims sahih bukhari for example served mainly as a ritual tool in the late middle ages al ghazali whose works are very important for the shafii madhhab only started to learn the two sahihs shortly before his death
1551163 the two sahihs were already canonic generations before al daraqutni 306 385 as shown by the earlier critiques commentaries and mustakhrajs of ibn abi hatim d
1551164 on monday 14 jumada al akhira at the time of the dawn prayer my brother abu hamid made his ablution prayed then said bring me my shroud he took it kissed it and put it on his eyes saying we hear and obey in readiness to enter the kings presence sam an wa ta atan lil dukhuli alal malik then he stretched his legs facing the qibla and died before sunrise may allah sanctify his soul
1551165 know that my wares in the science of hadith are poor
1551166 as for hadith the bare minimum in it is to become thoroughly familiar with the two sahihs verifying your copy by reading it with an expert in the science of hadith texts and it is not necessary for you to memorize the texts of the two sahihs but only familiarize yourself with them thoroughly this way you can obtain whatever you need out of them at will if you want more then add to them other compilations such as the narrations in the sound musnads as for the maximum then it encompasses everything else besides whether weak strong or sound together with knowledge of the many chains of transmission that are conveyed and mastery of the status of the narrators their names and their attributes
1551167 national party leader john key has been forced to confirm plans to open workplace accident insurance to private competition but has denied that amounts to privatising acc
1551168 publicly as best we can identify and contrary to the statements made by several insurers we have met with in new zealand the national party has made no formal statement on its plans for the acc
1551169 informally however we understand the national party has been very clear in saying it will privatise the acc
1551170 in the face of damaging leaks from the insurance industry national has finally come clean and admitted it
1551171 that donating the reward of our worship to the dead is permissible but where does it say this in a specific shafiite fiqh reference
1551172 were not a country thats come about as a result of civil war or where theres been a lot of fighting internally were were a country which peacefully came together
1551173 hes simply repeating the myths he was told at school back in the 60s and 70s an era when our education system wasnt exactly known for its accurate portrayal of new zealand history and otoh this is a man who wants to be prime minister who will have to negotiate with those who suffered those terrible injustices if he is to advance his ambitious treaty settlement programme
1551174 and with their leader making what was an obvious gaff his spin doctors were fair humming threatening to take our media outlet to the broadcasting standards authority for producing what they claimed was an unbalanced and inaccurate story but they didnt file a case simply because they know they couldnt win it the torys michelin man gerry brownlee waded into the argument waving an email around in the bear pit claiming our media outlet had made a retraction in that it had quoted his boss out of context he asked leave of his colleagues to enter the email into the parliamentary records but never produced it basically because it didnt say what he claimed it said
1551175 prime minister helen clark yesterday indicated a referendum was unlikely to be held at this years election even if campaigners had enough signatures on their petition because of the organisation it would take to stage a referendum but mr key today told reporters that if the campaigners have the numbers it should be held at the election this year well the referendum should take place at the general election in 2008 and quite frankly the behaviour of the prime minister smacks of arrogance and wasteful behaviour
1551176 the election date is aroud five months away and the chief electoral office is a very capable operator who can handle the addition of a referendum question they read the newspapers and would have contingency plans for if the petition succeeds and is held with the election

1551182 was ashari the shaykh of sacred law and hadith the conclusive definitive
1551183 and others all of these were imams of the asharis
1551184 clark alleged for those who werent watching that key benefited financially from the sale of tranzrail while a director of bankers trust which advised the former national administration on the privatisation of the state asset nz rail in 1993
1551185 bankers trust pocketed 39m in profit ask yourself the question who benefited from the sale of tranzrail mr key and his friends she told parliament she further claimed that keys family trust owned 30 000 shares in tranzrail at a time that key made comments as opposition associate transport spokesman in 2003 in which key made disparaging remarks about the governments offer for the company and suggested toll was more likely to win the bid the only problem is that keys family trust had already sold its shares before key made his comments he has told parliament this afternoon and so i imagine he must be very certain of this that neither he nor his trust held any shares in tranzrail at the time he made his remarks in june 2003
1551186 of course one could have checked the facts rather than just make it up i mean to have the prime minister accuse the leader of the opposition of such a serious thing and to get it wrong should result in apologies

1551254 brides want everything to match from the tablecloths to the dresses to the invitations
1551255 it really teaches you that you have to be careful when someone asks you to be in their wedding because it is so expensive you have to limit yourself to your closest friends
1551256 you put so much money into just being in their wedding
1551257 it would make all the difference if the bride said this is your gift
1551258 it was a black lace baby doll dress what she was trying to do was have a dress that wasnt too expensive and something we could wear again but it was horrendous and really tacky
1551259 we wanted her to pick a dress that looked good on all of us
1551260 pick the bridesmaid with the best taste and send her to nordstrom j c penney whatever come back to the bride with three dresses and let her make the decision dont require the bridesmaids to have matching shoes or hairstyles leave some individuality so they dont feel theyre part of barbies wedding fantasy

1551265 argentina es la favorita pero los dem s equipos estamos en condiciones de vencernos unos a otros por eso creo que quien gane este jueves tendr grandes posibilidades de sobrevivir al grupo debemos aprovecharlo
1551266 es cierto que no hemos podido subirnos al podio a n pero tambi n lo es que la gente nos mira con otros ojos desde el mundial de alemania esperamos estar a la altura de las circunstancias
1551267 el equipo ha estado de gira por un par de semanas y se ha acostumbrado a jugar con este calor en mi caso es diferente porque reci n me he sumado la ltima semana de todos modos tendremos que adaptar nuestro juego a estas condiciones
1551268 formar parte de un juego ol mpico no se presenta todos los d as y hay que aprovecharlo a m en lo personal me encantar a poder presenciar las pruebas de nataci n aunque no pueda hacerlo por motivos obvios
1551269 no recuerdo mucho de aquel partido hace cuatro a os pero el equipo actual es muy fuerte f sicamente y habr que estar muy atentos y dar lo mejor de nosotros para imponernos tendremos a nuestra mejor alineaci n disponible en cancha y eso deber a notarse
1551270 no siento ninguna presi n por ser uno de los jugadores mayores de 23 a os pero me hago cargo de que tengo una responsabilidad importante
1551271 tengo la experiencia de los anteriores juegos ol mpicos y ya les he hablado a mis compa eros m s j venes de las situaciones excepcionales a las que se enfrentar n aqu adem s como el defensa m s veterano mi deber ser comandar la zaga durante los 90 minutos al igual que jung woo tendr la responsabilidad de ocuparse de los centrocampistas
1551272 de todas formas para m va a ser una labor bastante sencilla esta selecci n est mucho mejor preparada que la que ten amos hace cuatro a os en lo que respecta a nuestra organizaci n dentro y fuera de la cancha acudimos a grecia con un grupo de jugadores sin experiencia internacional pero este bloque ya ha tenido presencia en anteriores campeonatos de categor as menores de la fifa
1551273 aparte del tema de la edad para m no hay ninguna diferencia entre los juegos ol mpicos y la copa mundial
1551274 los juegos ol mpicos son el mayor acontecimiento deportivo del mundo mientras que la copa mundial es el mayor acontecimiento del mundo relativo a un solo deporte pero ambos son algo grandioso como jugador est claro que me entran las mismas ganas de hacerlo bien quiero una medalla en este torneo tanto como quer a quedar entre los tres primeros hace dos a os en alemania
1551275 de momento est siendo una experiencia magn fica y eso que a n no hemos disputado ning n partido
1551276 nos ha llevado mucho tiempo estar aqu y vivir esta experiencia es algo nico una oportunidad de las que s lo se presentan una vez en la vida estoy seguro que en alg n momento todos hemos so ado con participar en esta competici n y ganar la medalla de oro me imagino que estamos haciendo realidad nuestros sue os
1551277 cuando vimos el resultado del sorteo lo cierto es que nos preocupamos
1551278 no conocemos bien ninguno de estos equipos y en esta categor a las cualidades desconocidas son las m s peligrosas para ellos seremos el equipo a batir as que estoy seguro que honduras la rep blica de corea y camer n ser n rivales inc modos y nos costar mucho derrotarlos

1551306 your right these guys are showing their commitment to the lord big time ouch that sampson dude is limping away all those muscles and hes balling hes just a kid i dont think he is even strong enough to carry water hes getting cut without even knowing what he can do

1551331 the proposals funded this year using advanced biomedical approaches will lead to a much deeper understanding than has been possible in the past on how celestial radiation differs from radiation on earth
1551332 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year
1551333 there is no other instance where new vaccines must be made every year the approval of flu vaccines is a part of fdas mission to promote the health of americans throughout the year
1551334 currently only 40 percent of health care workers in the united states are vaccinated against influenza
1551335 increasing the number of vaccinated health care personnel can be a strong front in the annual battle against the flu
1551336 health care workers can set an example for the patients they serve as well as decrease the likelihood of contracting and transmitting the virus
1551337 there are no more excuses internet service providers can no longer drag their feet when it comes to protecting children and purging this deplorable and illegal material from their servers
1551338 we are sending a message in long island and across the nation that companies who do not adopt these sensible reforms and make a commitment to fight online child pornography will hear from my office
1551339 cablevision has committed to work with my office to proactively purge online child pornography and i applaud them for it i encourage consumers on long island to visit my website www nystopchildporn com to ensure that their isps are also taking all possible steps to rid the internet of this despicable content
1551340 attorney general cuomo continues to set the standard in the fight against child pornography and the national center for missing and exploited children is proud to call him a partner these settlements and actions by the attorney generals office go to straight to the source in order to remove the volumes of reprehensible material that exist online
1551341 this award is further testament to the districts strong financial systems commitment to excellence and dedication to public stewardship
1551342 it takes teamwork to reach these high standards and it simply wouldnt be possible to attain this certificate year after year without the contributions of so many
1551343 our employees our students and our taxpayers can all be proud of this accomplishment
1551344 the floral business has one of the highest percentages of failure in small business statistics
1551345 businesses that receive coaching and training assistance from isbdc grow on the average 1 000 percent faster than an average business in idaho
1551346 every time i meet with my coach frank bendinelli we focus on a new way that i can improve my business
1551347 once i have mastered that we move on to a new area of improvement
1551348 the isbdc has been there for me through all the stages of my business
1551349 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
1551350 much in the gafcon documents is consonant with much of what we have sought to say and do and we need to look for the best ways of building bridges here
1551351 our absence focused minds on the problems within the communion and spoke louder than our presence would have
1551352 the primates council of gafcon will wish to study the outcome of the lambeth conference carefully and consult with those they are leading they are meeting towards the end of august and will make their response following that meeting
1551353 a spirit of mutual submission to prevail and for unity to be restored
1551354 most valuable opportunity to express our thoughts and concerns and to listen to the concerns of others
1551355 pertain to central moral teaching while the last is a matter simply of administration and good order
1551356 stand in solidarity with all the faithful bishops clergy and laity in the united states and canada and elsewhere who are suffering recrimination and hostility perpetrated upon them by their dioceses and or national churches which have not unequivocally complied with the specific windsor proposals required of them in full
1551357 engage theologically and practically with situations of controversy as they arise or divisive actions that may be taken around the communion
1551358 look within the next two months for a clear and detailed specification for the task and composition of a pastoral forum
1551359 substantial theological voices outside of the western world have not been present in the evening plenary sessions of the lambeth conference
1551360 continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide
1551361 attempts to cause divisions and break the bonds between churches in the global south
1551362 the realities in our churches are often misrepresented and misunderstood in the west
1551363 how to move the global anglican communion substantially and effectively forward
1551364 all orthodox groups in the united states of america and canada to listen together to what lord jesus says to his church today to draw strength and insights from one another and to take fresh initiatives in upholding and passing on the faith once delivered to the saints
1551365 there will be some who cannot abide by these moratoria and in this they signal that there are steps to deeper unity they cannot take or it may be that they conceive of deeper unity in other ways
1551366 as incumbent on me and on us in the diocese to actively labor to both understand the position of those to whom that moratorium is important and to convey the reality of our life together to the world
1551367 we will pay close attention to it but we must not reify the agreement points in it into laws and we should resist interpretations that seek to employ those agreements as laws
1551368 resist the temptation of those who will try to turn this descriptive document into a proscriptive edict
1551369 to break the cycle of being bullied into bigotry and distracted from mission and ministry by those who would exclude us because of our commitment to the full inclusion of all the baptized in the body of christ
1551370 we look forward to general convention 2009 and the opportunities we will have there to move the church further forward on the journey toward full inclusion
1551371 we remind our bishops that we cannot live up to our baptismal vows to respect the dignity of every human being if we tell some of them that they are good enough to arrange our flowers play our organs direct our choirs teach our sunday schools and lead our worship but not good enough to have their vocations affirmed and their relationships blessed
1551372 there is nothing generous about asking the lgbt faithful to bear the burden of unity of the anglican communion on their shoulders and there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized to the will of a majority
1551373 face to face with fellow believers who hold a view of scripture that i cannot understand
1551374 to the level of saving the faith or should be the cause of the breaking of communion
1551375 hold together as much as i can for as long as i can that when he comes to his rightful place on st augustines throne in canterbury cathedral he will have a faithful and richly textured kingdom
1551376 since i had no way to contact you about any of the details i had to assume you were too busy with your own happy plans to be concerned about our wedding we just assumed you were no longer interested but i do hope you and groom will still be able to come
1551377 i know that with the demands of planning your wedding moving etc that you have been really busy so i just want you to know that if you feel as if the pressure is too much to handle i will completely understand if you feel that you are unable to be a bm in my wedding

1551379 should we leave the bridesmaids to their own devices and let them each pick their own dresses the dress that had been picked out resembled a black evening dress so i think that if we told them to find a floor length black evening dress that they liked things would be all right
1551380 this was a shopping mall now its all covered with daisies if this is paradise i wish i had a lawnmower
1551381 the real difficulty the difficulty which has baffled the sages of all times is rather this how can we make our teaching so potent in the motional life of man that its influence should withstand the pressure of the elemental psychic forces in the individual
1551382 go out into the world today and love the people you meet let your presence light new light in the hearts of people
1551383 no matter what age you are or what your circumstances might be you are special and you still have something unique to offer your life because of who you are has meaning
1551384 the human contribution is the essential ingredient it is only in the giving of oneself to others that we truly live
1551385 it is rare indeed that people give most people guard and keep they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be
1551386 it is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving
1551387 my children know i love them even if i do not tell them
1551388 the most satisfying thing in life is to have been able to give a large part of one to others
1551389 in helping others we shall help ourselves for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us
1551390 you give but little when you give of your possessions it is when you give of yourself that you truly give
1551391 he who obtains has little he who scatters has much
1551392 a handful of pine seed will cover mountains with the green majesty of forests i too will set my face to the wind and throw my handful of seed on high
1551393 we must give more in order to get more it is the generous giving of ourselves that produce the generous harvest
1551394 in giving a man receives more than he gives and the more is in proportion to the worth of the thing given
1551395 if we want a love message to be heard it has got to be sent out to keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it
1551396 i want you to be concerned about your next door neighbor do you know your next door neighbor
1551397 it is easy to love the people far away it is not always easy to love those close to us it is easier to give a cup of rice to relieve hunger than to relieve the loneliness and pain of someone unloved in our own home bring love into your home for this is where our love for each other must start
1551398 the real difficulty the difficulty which has baffled the sages of all times is rather this how can we make our teaching so potent in the motional life of man that its influence should withstand the pressure of the elemental psychic forces in the individual
1551399 dominate our political process so we cannot act as an honest broker in the middle east

1551402 do you think we should get vaccinated for the menangitis
1551403 see thats an example of white privilege youve probably never thought of where you get your vaccines youve always thought they are just normal vaccines us black folks look at it differently i always get vaccinated in a white neighborhood who knows what theyre putting in those vaccines around here
1551404 im not saying i believe this but there is a huge faction of people who think that aids was created to wipe out africa think of africa it has all the resources you would need rainforest desert oceans lakes but it isnt working why not wipe out all those black folks with a deadly cancer a lot of people think that when the missionaries were doing work there allegedly giving the smallpox vaccine they were actually infecting people perhaps unknowingly with a government approved hiv virus

1551465 you learned who he liked and who he didnt like he could be intimidating but i think he was the funniest cat i ever met
1551466 i thought he was the bill evans of the guitar
1551467 my father liked joes playing which mattered a lot to me
1551468 joe could do something very few guitarists could do he truly orchestrated his playing when he accompanied you thats rare
1551469 i knew him as a musician but we got to be friends
1551470 he would never tell me what it needed to be a perfect record
1551471 i realized after a while it was his way of saying that he liked my playing
1551472 the government has therefore asked the artists for the three designs ranked most highly by the evaluation panel to address remaining technical design and siting issues
1551473 each of the three designs is quite distinct in terms of form and materials and unresolved technical and design issues have been identified with each of the proposals
1551474 such fine tuning is expected with works of this scale and significance and the government has elected to give each of the three highest ranked entrants the chance to resolve outstanding issues before a final decision is made

1551480 the purpose of the curfew was to provide structure to the community as a whole so we didnt have kids out late and getting in trouble
1551481 when kids are loitering around looking for things to do they tend to do destructive things
1551482 a lot of kids are very responsible and this just established a tool to take care of issues brought up by a small number of children
1551483 i wanted the kids to leave with a completed piece of art
1551484 a lot of the kids that come here arent able to come back so i wanted them to leave with a finished product
1551485 i knew it had been sent off but i knew there was like a one in a million chance i was going to win
1551486 ive been drawing since i was in the fifth grade and i think im pretty good at it
1551487 i didnt think i was going to win and i was surprised
1551488 i think all these children have abilities they dont even know they have and once we expose them to the opportunities to actually do art and do it professionally theyre excited
1551489 we have those kids that are academically blessed and we have those kids who are athletically blessed and this is a whole other arena for these children
1551490 it turned out to be a little cooler and a little breezier than anticipated so i guess that was good too
1551491 under the rules we have to go two days in shorts and then two days in just shoulder pads before we get to the real football on the fifth day but its obvious that a lot of guys have done a lot of hard work this summer and prepared for this
1551492 it gives us more time particularly to work with our young players and guys who didnt play maybe as much last year when you split the groups in half like we have
1551493 were going to do this at least the first three days and then see how it shakes out after that
1551494 theres quite a few of them out there who made me go wow today but that was in shorts no pads so ill reserve the wows for a little while but we have a very talented group of newcomers
1551495 today is the worst day of my life i cant imagine that the person who destroyed a whole family got only two months
1551496 she has destroyed my family life my social life and she has destroyed me economically she destroyed my credibility
1551497 i thought she would have got more for what she put me and my family through
1551498 i was upset i was drunk and experienced a pain with my vagina
1551499 i arrived home at that stage i seriously believed i had experienced a genuine sexual assault
1551500 i returned to normality and realised it had not taken place by that time the police were on their way
1551501 the incident had spiralled out of control and i was concerned about what would happen if i said it had not happened at all
1551502 he couldnt find your home because you were not in a position to direct him to it and he took the trouble to ask at several places
1551503 you repaid that kindness by alleging that he had raped you
1551504 this was persisted with firstly when you believed it and then at a time when you did not believe it
1551505 the consequences were disastrous for mr ahmed who was arrested in front of his family
1551506 i accept fully that you have great remorse for what has happened
1551507 as you said sorry is a very short word it doesnt put matters right
1551508 i dont want you or anyone else to have the impression that people can make these allegations and get away with it
1551509 it was extremely serious what you did and i would be failing in my duty if i didnt reflect that in the sentence i impose today
1551510 its naivety a lack of understanding and a lack of judgment which has caused this young lady to persist in story telling
1551511 but i said another level i suppose thats cheesy too well beure why dont you write the words then

1551581 we are so made that we raise to the skies anyone who goes about beating his drum and indulges in political acrobatics but fail to appreciate the silent worker
1551582 no other religion gave as much importance to non violence piety etc as buddhism did

1551585 he had not witnessed such a death so far it was exactly as kabir described in the following couplet the servant kabir says although we wear this sheet with ever so much care it has to be given up even as it is
1551586 if we can all befriend death in this manner it would be to the good of india
1551587 we should send to ceylon as quickly as we can some indians who follow buddhism and are desirous of learning pali

1551590 press of this country the united states from the most radical to the most conservative is unanimous in praising you and the indian national movement
1551591 how am i to work on a buddhist vihar committee
1551592 are they all going to become buddhists where is the need
1551593 there is no question of anyone becoming a buddhist the temple is meant to be one dedicated to buddha as temples are dedicated to rama krishna and the like there is no proselytising taint about this movement at the most it is to be a hindu temple of an advanced type in which a very learned man will be keeper or pujari that is how i have understood the whole scheme of prof kosambi you may share this with the professor and if he endorsed my position with shri natarajan presumably another promoter of the temple idea so that there may be a common understanding about the temple
1551594 i cannot understand this obstinacy on kosambis part please plead with him again to desist
1551595 he takes charge of one when ones time is over
1551596 so if you must depart first enshrine rama in your heart and then go to meet him cheerfully
1551597 keep me informed of any changes in kosambis condition i prefer cremation but i shall not insist on it
1551598 kosambi had expressed a desire to be buried after death it being the least expensive disposal of the body
1551599 very happy that you are staying in the sewagram ashram
1551600 to forget about such matters and fix his mind on withdrawing himself into a state of inner concentration whether the body subsists a little longer or withers away soon

1551607 gibbet they may stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the land they may turn every rock into a scaffold every tree into a gallows every home into a grave and yet the words on that parchment can never die
1551608 they may pour our blood on a thousand scaffolds and yet from every drop that dyes the axe or drips on the sawdust of the block a new martyr to freedom will spring into birth
1551609 the british king may blot out the stars of god from his sky but he cannot blot out his words written on the parchment there the works of god may perish his word never
1551610 these words will go forth to the world when our bones are dust
1551611 yes that parchment will speak to the kings in a language sad and terrible as the trump of the archangel
1551612 now purpled hangmen of the world turn and beg for mercy
1551613 not from the people for you stand baptized in their blood
1551614 now executioners of the human race kneel down yes kneel down upon the sawdust of the scaffold lay your perfumed heads upon the block bless the axe as it falls the axe that you sharpened for the poor mans neck
1551615 such is the message of that declaration to man to the kings of the world
1551616 what are these shrinking hearts and faltering voices here when the very dead of our battlefields arise and call upon us to sign that parchment or be accursed forever
1551617 sign and not only for yourselves but for all ages
1551618 sign for that declaration will go forth to american hearts forever and speak to those hearts like the voice of god
1551619 look at this strange history of a band of exiles and outcasts suddenly transformed into a people look at this wonderful exodus of the oppressed of the old world into the new where they came weak in arms but mighty in godlike faith nay look at this history of your bunker hill your lexington where a band of plain farmers mocked and trampled down the panoply of british arms and then tell me if you can that god has not given america to the free
1551620 it is not given to our poor human intellect to climb the skies to pierce the councils of the almighty one
1551621 he stands there the angel his hands trembling with the black record of human guilt
1551622 as god lives my friends i believe that to be his voice
1551623 yes as i sank down into the gloomy shadows of the grave with my last gasp i would beg you to sign that parchment in the name of the god who made the saviour who redeemed you in the name of the millions whose very breath is now hushed in intense expectation as they look up to you for the awful words

1551630 no particular effect will be felt on the bullying of the so called upper castes by becoming buddhist or arya samajist so we see no meaning in following this path to successfully confront the domination of hindus we should become christians or muslims and win the support of a powerful community and with this erase the mark of untouchability
1551631 unfortunately i was born a hindu it was beyond my power to prevent that but i solemnly assure you that i will not die a hindu
1551632 kosambi was a great intellect but k chandrasekharans boast was that as deputy director he could meet the director without a prior appointment
1551633 every matrix has a diagonal even a rectangular matrix has a diagonal

1551635 export oriented agriculture and food security in developing countries and in india
1551636 on the inverse relation between primary exports and food absorption in developing countries under liberalized trade regimes
1551637 the book should not have been written in the first place it is not even worth a review but for the fact that it has been written by a founder of the communist party of india
1551638 look i stand for peace but my dog does not stand for peace so next time take an appointment his dogs name was rocker
1551639 but how do we get this message across to the students
1551640 young man if after talking to you for one and a half hour if you have still not understood the world peace movement i have no more time for you your exams are fast coming near so you better go back and study your books
1551641 why confine yourself with only communist literature instead stock progressive books by sartre etc unless there is a very strong communist movement for the very viability and survival of the bookshop youll have to stock progressive literature which is more than just soviet books
1551642 why dont you include my review of danges book too
1551643 id rather not include the review of danges book this is because i sincerely want the party comrades to read your works if i include the review of danges book than it might deflect some party people and probably might dissuade them into not buying the book
1551644 well if you have money give it to me ill just buy some more books from you
1551645 im glad that you are not carried away by the party line
1551646 heres a man who has a capacity for some scholarship but this man just refuses to see things
1551647 thats a real scholar who doesnt forget things but pursues them doggedly
1551648 what kind of people do we have they dont even write back even when i send them the stationary this way how can we preserve our culture and develop scientific temper
1551649 if you post the letters they seem to reach fast
1551650 remember there is only a lone way passage that way and im going to buy a ticket soon
1551651 you intellectuals dont help us otherwise we can raise the question of the massive wastage in the heavy water plant in the parliament
1551652 sometimes it is better not to identify the source if you give me your word of not divulging the name then ill give you the information
1551653 yes kosambi is a very eminent man but why should an eminent man know about atomic energy
1551654 as you have so many interests to pursue you should retire however you can discuss the problem in my cabin
1551655 apart from growing long moustaches this man has done nothing after getting his wranglers degree why do people worship him so much in maharashtra
1551656 long before i joined the deccan college i had planned to reconstruct the history of india by a study of the puranas and also of sanskrit literature testing my conclusions in the light of archaeology
1551657 had read while young that here ruled king sahasrarjuna of the haihayas who alone among all other kings defeated ravana
1551658 we will see to it that the samadhi is henceforth renovated and well maintained
1551659 it is important that they know about this great personality and his contribution to society we will introduce the life of kosambi in goas school curriculum
1551660 it is an honour as we are celebrating two great goan minds today the lecture series will serve as a platform for an intellectual treat couto assured
1551661 it is not enough if intellectuals debate these issues in academic seminars the real battle has to be fought and won in the minds of the common man
1551662 its like cutting history off in the middle it should be preserved
1551663 i think the committee did a great job today of coming together and showing some unity on this issue it could have turned into something different but it was a positive outcome
1551664 this is a discriminatory act since its very clear we hispanics represent 42 percent of the city
1551665 the next point is when you have discrimination of this caliber it reinforces that we hispanics are inferior
1551666 use of a temporary nature only and would not form the basis of any copyright claim

1551668 ng what are your politics c none of us have politics that are possible to define in such brief space suffice to say that all of us detest sexism racism and bigotry in general and none of us have eaten meat or dairy produce in me and jeffs case in years
1551669 kita kaget karena selama ini dia sering dihujat kok malah menghujat dirinya sendiri dan terbawa bawa juga nama organisasi
1551670 so your decision to develop such a strong opinion means this is in some way threatening to you
1551671 stop playing computer games you lonely geeks and read a book if your too unpopular and introverted to go out
1551672 so your decision to develop such a strong opinion means this is in some way threatening to you

1551679 a lot of the smaller players will have a tough time surviving long term in the solar space
1551680 the solar industry is anticipated to go thru a rapid price decline
1551681 the solar industry is a new industry with young companies and a lot of risk involved when the market pulls back and reduces its exposure to risk then these solar and renewable energy companies in general are more susceptible to large price swings
1551682 have a lot of capacity expansion this year and next
1551683 a publicidade que viabiliza do ponto de vista financeiro a liberdade de imprensa e a difus o de cultura e entretenimento para toda a popula o a publicidade que torna poss vel a exist ncia de milhares de jornais revistas emissoras de r dio e televis o assim como de outras express es da m dia
1551684 as a result of your work as a result of this website the patients will now be informed they do have a right to know
1551685 i took care of difficult cases and desperate people and if the people are desperate and its a litigious society what do you expect
1551686 we need to know who we are trusting with our lives and our children our loved ones
1551687 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1551688 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1551689 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1551690 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1551691 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1551692 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1551693 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1551694 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1551695 the fearless vampire killers or pardon me but your teeth are in my neck
1551696 we will be like the birds of the sky we are going to live one day at a time
1551697 if she was selfless before her sickness always thinking of the needs of others now she was lamost unable to think of herself her sensitivity to others had grown to such a degree that she had completely stopped thinking of herself
1551698 has also created the tiny saints and these are content to be daisies or violets destined to please the eyes of god who has put them under his feet
1551699 whats really hard is putting so much importance into something when theres people grieving so much
1551700 she was playing outside with the hose and my brother went out and told her hey dont come out here anymore
1551701 but the gate was completely blocked out in the pool area so its still a mystery to this day how she got through the gate no one knows speculating only makes it worse
1551702 shed go out and get into everything and had no fear of stuff
1551703 im very religious and i think that when there are those times when theres complete difficulty and tribulation you will be picked up and given a ray of sunlight
1551704 you take that into account when you see what hes going through emotionally but you still coach him
1551705 we were going to give you 750 dollars for a down payment and you couldnt find anything for that down payment n because of the mess with your title next paragraph so you cant really get rid of your car
1551706 then today shes going on n on about how i shouldnt trust people and if i paid somone to work on the car that it should have been fixed and not having a problem ughhhh
1551707 takut banget akhirnya nyebar segala macam foto foto pribadi aku
1551708 and you want to be sensitive to the concerns of a larger community we make a point of contacting local police at each of our venues to let them know that there will be actors walking around with prop guns and recorded gunfire
1551709 you might think that a city that has problems with culture clashes of a violent nature would find this show appropriate after all its a play about the futility of violence where rage only subsides after a series of tragic deaths
1551710 an attorney who serves on the rep board took it upon himself to preemptively contact the executives office and tell us that smoking on stage is protected by the first amendment
1551711 theres no connection between smoking and free speech this arguments been tried before in other places and the courts never upheld it so when i heard that there was smoking on the stage i thought what if we have a complaint
1551712 we stuck with that with both kids good irish and good biblical names were just blessed to have such a beautiful family
1551713 what happened after that row over the chess illustrates pretty well the point im making
1551714 the first time you glimpse yourself through the eyes of a person like that its a cold moment its like walking past a mirror youve walked past every day of your life and suddenly it shows you something else something troubling and strange
1551715 there is a definite flavor of the velvet underground to be had but crystal stilts spectral avant garage also takes in such far flung references as the spooked 60s texas psych of 13th floor elevators and red crayola the gothic blues punk howl of gun club the dark experimental diyism of early flying nun xpressway groups pin group and plagal grind and a post punk minimalism that brings to mind early rough trade and factory releases there is definitely a strong pop element as well with the buzzsaw bubblegum of early mary chain b sides and meat whiplash coming to mind
1551716 these are weird pop songs you clap your hands along to they pile a rockabilly riff and nursery school melodies onto a revved up bass line and sweet surfy 60s organ riff on top of minimalist percussion
1551717 instead of lumping references on top of each other they tackle their influences head on and strip them to their bare essentials instead of trying to hide the influences they highlight them and bring out the best in them
1551718 it has that classic first ten creation releases era sound mixed with a drummer raised on a diet of only moe tucker and laura from the shop assistants
1551719 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1551720 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1551721 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1551722 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1551723 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise
1551724 trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1551725 no matter how much chemistry weve applied we still havent been able to find an artificial substitute for natural rubber
1551726 were still harvesting rubber the same way they did 1000 years ago by cutting into the tree and letting the sap drip into containers its not a very efficient system
1551727 it would be useful for tyre producers to have a safe and steady supply of natural rubber that would insulate us from the price increases of the last five to seven years

1551730 we were pretty crushed to lose in the first round at sonoma after having qualified so strongly and then running well in the round
1551731 you just dont expect to have to race robert hight in the opening round when youre in the top half so maybe that misfortune will turn around for us in brainerd
1551732 in sonoma we were pretty much the perfect example of doing everything right but getting nothing for it losing to robert in a very close race the truth is though that these qualifying points are just critical and weve really helped ourselves out a lot at the last couple of races by qualifying so well weve picked up 11 points on the tasca team just during qualifying at sonoma and seattle and when things are this tight those are 11 huge points thats also an indication that the car is running well because were not just holding on and trying to make the field were well up in the top half and running pretty strong but weve been ambushed pretty regularly by seriously great cars that are kind of out of place in the bottom half and we end up drawing guys like hight or ron capps in round one
1551733 i think about winning every time i head to a race so theres no denying that winning four rounds on sunday is on my mind
1551734 when you win a round or two you can still actually lose points to the team youre chasing if they go further than you do but theres one certain thing at this drag race and thats that the winner of the race gets the most points
1551735 before we get to that point though we have to get qualified and we need to keep up the good work in that department if we can land in the top half this weekend well still be running well and ill be excited then we simply have to win in the first round we might be able to catch tasca with individual qualifying points but we cant catch beckman that way so we have to put the pressure on and get some round wins with three races left its not over yet but i think we have to approach this weekend as a must win thing we cant have the attitude that we can still get em in reading or indy we need to get em now

1551738 were still kind of on the tail end of our family including wife shelley daughter taylor and son caden vacation that weve spent in our monaco coach traveling around the country since norwalk ohio june 29
1551739 its been very relaxing and fun but you have to balance that with showing up at the race track to race
1551740 however especially with three races left in this countdown chase were not completely safe in the top 10
1551741 its a lot fun being in brainerd a lot of us racers get on the golf carts and go to the zoo brainerds famous campground and see the fans at night and we have a great time but then you have to be focused to show up on sunday and race
1551742 right now we are also focused on moving ourselves up in the top 10
1551743 if we can stay on course and keep running as well as we have been lately we can fight into the top five come indianapolis you do not want to be teetering on the no 9 or 10 spot because we also have the showdown bonus event at indy for 100 000 wed like to win again
1551744 also now that were running to 1000 feet its completely changed everybodys mindset i really believe the racing has been better obviously its been safer but i think the fans are now understanding that changing the racing to 1000 feet was a great choice for the time being
1551745 there are a lot of things at this time of the season that can provide distractions if you let them

1551761 my reaction is we finally look forward to the opportunity to examine fully mr arthurs claim of innocence by assessing witness testimony and dna evidence
1551762 there is a good chance he is going to escape his sentence before all is said and done
1551763 having to face execution is something that most of us can never really imagine
1551764 i hired and paid money to thomas arthur not bobby gilbert to kill troy wicker
1551765 i hope to finally end this hope to finally prove the innocence that hes claimed for 26 years
1551766 it is very very reliable if you do two things right if you test it right and if you interpret the results right the problem is that jurors think its absolute and infallible

1551768 all this is pretty much a lot of noise hes going out with a whimper
1551769 its very difficult for him now his public approval is so poor he doesnt really have a lot of political capital
1551770 we can get good housing legislation done we can get good energy legislation done we can get trade bills done and theres plenty of time to get action with the united states congress
1551771 underlines and underscores that the main organization hes trying to help are the oil companies
1551772 you want the president involved but in the context of the election hes not on the ballot
1551773 its not clear hes turned anything around so the current view of him will probably endure for a while

1551777 buildings that fall in natural processes fall to the path of least resistance
1551778 weve been at this for a little over two years and doing a two or two and a half year investigation is not at all unusual thats the same kind of time frame that takes place when we do aeroplane crash investigations it takes a few years
1551779 its a very complex problem it requires a level of fidelity in the modelling and rigour in the analysis that has never been done before
1551780 t oday the dow jones average was down 350 some points gold was up 32 and oil was up another 5 there is a lot of chaos out there and everyone is worried about 4 gasoline but i dont think there is a clear understanding of exactly why that has occurred

1551782 in offering to you my countrymen these counsels of an old and affectionate friend i dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression i could wish that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations but if i may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit some occasional good that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism

1551809 on tuesday democratic voters in albuquerque proved that they want reform and theyre willing to vote against candidates who stand in its way in the process they knocked out two opponents of reform and changed the landscape in the state senate
1551810 its easy to imagine the two newcomers banding together with fellow albuquerque progressives like cisco mcsorley dede feldman and jerry ortiz y pino plus perhaps santa fes peter wirth who will be moving from the house to the senate and give new life to ethics reform which for the past few sessions has withered and died in the catacombs of the senate

1551813 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1551814 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1551815 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1551816 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1551817 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1551818 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1551819 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1551820 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
1551821 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1551822 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops over 10 years
1551823 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1551824 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1551825 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1551826 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
1551827 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise

1551849 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1551850 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1551851 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1551852 i would like to think what worked in my favor was the shoe leather i walked door to door in a lot of the precincts

1551858 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1551859 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions

1551864 this has been discussed in recent months as a way to honor veterans
1551865 there were discussions of renaming oak drive as veterans memorial drive and renaming the plaza the council wanted to do something extra to support veterans
1551866 right now we are just looking at what a price would be
1551867 it is not in the budget for this fiscal year so it would have to be next year
1551868 classes could come to the memorial and learn about the wars
1551869 the actual risk of having your identity stolen online is not as high as many people think
1551870 financial services companies are trying to reassure consumers but their marketing messages arent sticking companies need to find innovative new ways to convince americans that their identities are secure online and when using e mail

1551879 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1551880 will press hard for what i think is a very fair agreement
1551881 it makes it feel like youre back in the old south again its something entirely different
1551882 just across the street theres nothing but planted pines and one house
1551883 there are four families on this side of the road that would have to be displaced

1551885 if its in the pool you put as much of the chlorine in there that you can to try to kill it
1551886 you never know when the pools going to be exposed to the cryptosporidium
1551887 many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprang up
1551888 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1551889 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1551890 thats a big step towards going green which is in my opinion worth a little bit of extra effort
1551891 you could tell who had probably waitressed before because they had four trays on one arm or four plates and all the glasses on the other
1551892 it was kind of a range of emotions youve got the people whod come in and say i really like what youre doing im glad uds is taking a step in this direction
1551893 but youd also have the students that would run by and shout this is dumb i dont get why were doing this
1551894 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1551895 we know that terrorists seek targets to achieve mass casualties spectacular images economic impact and damage to that which has symbolic value to america
1551896 obviously were very disappointed weve got excellent schools wed like to keep it that way
1551897 it is unlikely that additional spending cuts can be implemented in the short term
1551898 however the pressure to achieve cuts much greater than the planned 1bn for 2009 will now intensify even this year the governments announced spending curbs may not be sufficient to prevent the deficit exceeding the eu limit of 3pc of output gdp
1551899 ireland may not breach eu rules on deficits this year but it will be very tight
1551900 if new houses are not selling when they are completed there is no vat
1551901 the figures show that the slowdown has spread now from the housing market into the retail side and has impacted on consumer confidence

1551905 weve done all the investigation weve got our own laboratory now all he had was malaria tablets and it was nothing to do with that it wasnt malaria i doubt well get rooney for the start of the season
1551906 i dont know whether we will have a team ready ferguson added of the newcastle game
1551907 the current global economic conditions will have an inevitable impact on northern irelands economic performance
1551908 although growth is forecast to decline in 2008 it is expected to remain relatively robust at around 1 8pc
1551909 a strong labour market and recent success in foreign labour market and export markets should help limit the impact of the slowdown on the economy
1551910 but no my people would not listen so i let them follow their own stubborn desires living according to their own ideas oh that my people would listen to me oh that israel would follow me walking in my paths how quickly i would subdue her enemies i would feed you with the finest of wheat i would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock

1551913 after being out here for 16 years you learn what is best suited for each player and its different for everybody
1551914 you know each player is an individual and what works best for me may not work best for others i think i owe it to myself to stay with the plan that i know and have learned that allows me to play my best
1551915 my reaction after the trade was that we just went from being a really good team to one that has a chance to really win this thing
1551916 we knew that when we got him that was part of the equation
1551917 my favorite current raiders player is darren mcfadden hes really looking good
1551918 i think this is the year we get back to respectability im sick and tired of hearing the raiders being trashed by every analyst for the past 5 years not that they havent deserved it being the worst franchise in that time span but it needs to come to an end
1551919 hes always out here early hes always out here learning
1551920 was it marriage defined as between a man and a woman well yes but only in the sense that a cheese omelet is defined as an egg and some cheese without the least intention of insulting either orange juice or toast by their omission from this definition orange juice and toast are fine things in themselves you just cant make an omelet out of them
1551921 in the current debate on gay marriage its advocates are cast in the role of long oppressed suppliants demanding their just due
1551922 listen tell you what ill give her my cell phone and you can call her anytime you want
1551923 hmmmm i can make a nice summer top from these

1551937 its hard to fill a gas tank on the shoulder of the interstate in 4 inch heels while someone is mocking you with a camera but thats what happens when you dont think the gas gauge really means it yet
1551938 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
1551939 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
1551940 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
1551941 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto

1551947 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
1551948 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating
1551949 yeah the pee phrase kept coming out of order something about how he peed in worship it confused me
1551950 i like how we just had an extended conversation about ryans buttocks actually i dont really like that

1552226 the wine trials 100 everyday wines under 15 that beat 50 to 150 wines in brown bag blind tastings
1552227 most wine in the world is cheap wine its only in the last 10 years or so that wines over 50 have taken off its really a success of marketing not taste
1552228 there have always been good wines and better wines but the luxury products manufacturers and the mass brands got really smart about marketing their products
1552229 i was trying for a broad swath of wine drinkers
1552230 what this proves to me is that people should do blind tastings and find out what they like
1552231 i think the worst cheap wine is the mass produced wine that is trying to imitate the expensive international style the best cheap wine is one that is just trying to be itself a nice table wine thats refreshing or well balanced or has a nice acidity
1552232 but i wanted to make sure that the wines were readily available
1552233 i think in this economy its important for people to figure out what they really like and they now have even more of a financial incentive to wine taste and figure out whats behind the label instead of being seduced by the label

1552260 last year we were proud to have the challenge of playing one of the toughest schedules in the country
1552261 i believe this schedule certainly compares favorably to any weve put together since weve been at georgia we will be challenged at home and at some tough places on the road i also think its a schedule that our fans can get excited about and start making plans for a great season all of us are looking forward to building upon the great ending to our season last march
1552262 we are honored to be playing in the nit season tip off
1552263 i think it speaks well to our programs accomplishments that we will represent the sec in the field it will give our young team some great experience early in the season

1552265 compared to houses condominiums typically offer more energyefficient eco friendly living centralized water heating in our building reduces the standby losses experienced with numerous water heaters used less frequently shared walls lessen the heating load of the building exterior lights benefit all inhabitants reducing individual electricity consumption and the smaller footprint of high density buildings frees up open spaces for all to enjoy despite these benefits condo owners can find it difficult to implement narrowly supported green efforts like a compost pile or rain barrels in the yard i expected a solar system would be one of those cases to my surprise however the other owners in the building welcomed our plans
1552266 most of us avoid thinking about what happens when oil runs out or becomes prohibitively expensive but
1552267 the only technology incorporated is a 12 volt lighting system powered by a solar charged marine battery two sides of the building open to draw in the adjacent national forest land and allow views to the lake three bi folding doors operate independently allowing the user to open just one or all thus converting the interior in to a stage like volume and a chapel since we were married there small aperture like windows contrast the large openings and provide framed views of the surrounding wilderness

1552281 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
1552282 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
1552283 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
1552284 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
1552285 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
1552286 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
1552287 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1552288 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1552289 thatll require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tide and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy such as offshore drilling

1552294 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy
1552295 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1552296 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1552297 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1552298 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1552299 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1552300 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1552301 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1552302 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something

1552311 its a very intellectual science fiction film a very difficult book to translate cinematically at least we have found it very difficult to translate to get ready for film
1552312 these things they always want to make it into an action film you cant do it with this and weve been having trouble getting someone to see the science aspect of this the exploratory aspects of it rather than the blood and guts and stuff

1552318 there are further falls in store for precious metals but the bigger picture is that they will come back up again and as equity prices have softened in line with the underlying commodity this is probably a cheap buy
1552319 i know that you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did
1552320 for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory

1552322 it was the second floor and it was really crazy we were like oh hi but she was so sweet she was very nervous

1552324 its really really special for us its america and its our first american award and thats so huge
1552325 i think the jonas brothers are really sexy in america
1552326 its so crazy i mean i still cant believe it
1552327 last year we were nominated at the mtv europe music awards they won one and it was the biggest thing we had and now it is the video music awards
1552328 i think we are the most nervous band in the world we are together nervous
1552329 we are right now in the studio in europe and we are producing our third record so i think there are some surprises
1552330 ive always have my laptop with me and a pen
1552331 i think it would be so cool to meet rihanna
1552332 todays move means that symptom free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy
1552333 the mhra is keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management
1552334 we did this record on our own paid for it ourselves with no expectations of what was going to happen with it if it was even going to be finished let alone released
1552335 i still see myself as more of a music fan than a professional musician
1552336 to get to play with wilco as a wilco fan
1552337 i mean were not wilcos peers at all you know
1552338 that kind of vocal based music is what ive most listened to since i was a tot i mean ive gone through periods of writing that werent as harmony based but just in terms of recording this lp the process kind of determined what the band is almost we were just laying down all these ideas straight to tape some songs never having played live and we just determined it made sense to have the whole record come from this same place and have a lot of similar singing things going on
1552339 scarves of red tied round their throats to keep their little heads from falling in the snow
1552340 to me one of the pitfalls of revivalism is that youre speaking outside your own experience
1552341 and we get inspiration from everywhere but we are mindful of expressing ourselves and our own ideas some people may interpret it as old or new but its just coming from us
1552342 ive found that if i tried to write something specifically new sounding it somehow diluted what i was doing if you are not the lucky dude with the right sensibility that youre totally brand new and everyone hears it as new then the best thing to do ive found is to write songs you think are ok and not really worry about sounding old or new
1552343 but i really feel like this current group of people feels like the creative beings that should be doing this ive never been part of a creative synergy thats this strong ever
1552344 casey and i are both wearing keys that go into the death switch
1552345 yeah its the kill switch for robin so when its that time its like its over
1552346 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1552347 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1552348 hoping to pepper the campus with various projects point out where interesting research is being done and designate areas where the campus has gone green
1552349 help build a green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty
1552350 people observe the city while moving through it and along these paths the other environmental elements are arranged and related
1552351 for me the loudest knock of all however has been from passion trying to enter into the language of both public art and environmental interpretation two site based disciplines that create a powerful sense of destination but often leave out the sense of process the exploring perceiving and digging deeper perhaps the real challenge is to give this process material forms to infuse the art product with the passion of the creative act
1552352 i keep it too real why is n as fakin
1552353 wish i had me some money id buy me some better luck

1552370 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1552371 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1552372 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1552373 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1552374 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1552375 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1552376 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1552377 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1552378 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it
1552379 you know im going to check into this whole vampire thing
1552380 did i do this wrong is this a rule i didnt know about
1552381 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do

1552399 hemos establecido que estas movilizaciones comenzando por la huelga de los c vicos del departamento de santa cruz seguida por el manejo de las personas con discapacidad es un plan para boicotear y evitar que este domingo se realice en nuestro pa s el referendo revocatorio
1552400 existe toda una estrategia para la toma de las cortes departamentales en todo el pa s para de esa manera evitar que el domingo la poblaci n asista a emitir su voto y definir democr tica que autoridades se quedan y se van

1552407 es importante no s lo por la proximidad del referendo revocatorio sino por la necesidad de pacificar al pa s los diferentes sectores deben resolver todas las controversias que tienen con el gobierno a trav s del di logo
1552408 consideramos que eso sin duda afecta esas celebraciones pero fundamentalmente afecta a sucre que se merec a una celebraci n y una sesi n de honor del congreso nacional

1552414 el gobierno exige una investigaci n judicial sobre estos hechos ocurridos en la localidad de caihuasi

1552418 but we are finding that as people cram vantage points to see it they are potentially putting themselves at risk
1552419 we had one instance this morning of school pupils on the actual line near te horo just north of waikanae
1552420 we want people to see and enjoy the parliamentary special but we also want them to remain safe
1552421 our advice is to look for obvious vantage points that provide some elevation away from the track itself
1552422 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1552423 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1552424 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1552425 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1552426 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1552427 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1552428 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith
1552429 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1552430 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1552431 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1552432 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1552433 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1552434 we may be able to do some things we believe we need to do perhaps go through a discussion document process you wouldnt be able to do them straight off
1552435 ive said nothing that i am concerned about all i said was you should build public confidence in what you are doing and you should consult people make things transparent
1552436 this is probably some of the most dirty tricks that ive seen in 24 years in this parliament ive never seen anything like it before
1552437 helen clarks got to either disown this new low in politics or shes got to wear it
1552438 goodness knows who was in there pretending to be a delegate it certainly wasnt a national person
1552439 oh you can hang the bottle up where ever you want to
1552440 when we try and understand where the mother is coming from she is a mother who is concerned about having an ailing child and what their future and the child s future is going to be like but unfortunately in india there is no proper counselling for a situation like this
1552441 thanks for contacting we are trying our hardest to have as many modes as possible our main criterion is that anything that goes in must be stellar quality
1552442 we will be covering several vast areas of what is basically wilderness and then there are the flights over water
1552443 we want our support team to know exactly where we are and what sort of progress we are making
1552444 this is an exciting adventure because it is a mix of endurance for both man and machine taking place on a global stage and we feel privileged to have been chosen to be a part of it
1552445 we have now been involved in several expeditions where people have pushed themselves to the limit in difficult conditions and this one will be no different in terms of what we want to deliver in the way of providing a world class tracking system
1552446 quando esses partidos assumiram o poder imediatamente suas reputa es ideol gicas se deslocaram para a direita
1552447 em 2005 encontrei seis parlamentares do pt que disseram que o estado n o deveria ter papel algum na economia isso era algo impens vel h 20 anos
1552448 a direita n o precisaria mudar porque j pratica as pol ticas que os mercados querem
1552449 quanto tempo demoraria na d cada de 1970 para os estados unidos derrubarem um chefe de estado como hugo ch vez que chamou o presidente norte americano de dem nio naquela poca eles invadiam pa ses por muito menos
1552450 n o foi um estudo quantitativo mas podemos dizer que a maioria das ind strias analisadas busca a sustentabilidade desde o in cio da cadeia produtiva comprando mat rias primas certificadas seja para desenvolver apenas um insumo ou para chegar ao produto final esse foi um dos crit rios para a conclus o de que o processo produtivo das bioind strias da regi o sustent vel do ponto de vista ambiental
1552451 as pequenas ind strias que ainda n o trabalham com certifica o de mat rias primas est o tentando se adequar a esse sistema de selo verde que garante o uso sustent vel da biodiversidade regional isso porque as ind strias que ainda n o certificam suas mat rias primas t m dificuldade por exemplo para exportar seus produtos o problema ainda s o os altos custos para essa adequa o
1552452 essas bioind strias introduziram novas bases t cnicas em suas linhas de produ o de modo a valorizar a inova o tecnol gica em seus produtos e processos
1552453 apesar de j ter sido encerrado o probem foi fundamental para alavancar o setor bioindustrial e as redes de pesquisa em bioprospec o outra meta do probem foi a implanta o do centro de biotecnologia da amaz nia em manaus
1552454 o desenvolvimento de produtos inovadores nas bioind strias pesquisadas est fortemente vinculado s universidades e institui es de pesquisa locais al m das ind strias tamb m manterem parcerias com laborat rios de outros estados para an lise e agrega o de valor a novos produtos

1552464 there was nothing to suggest he was forced into a position and bound
1552465 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1552466 through our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter we have significantly reduced our going forward operating expenses we are targeting operating expenses in the current quarter to come in about 10 to 15 percent less than our fourth quarter
1552467 we are expecting revenues of approximately 130 to 140 million in the current period due to adverse macroeconomic conditions which we see continuing through our fiscal q2 and because we may be de emphasizing some of our underperforming businesses we are projecting lower year over year revenues
1552468 valencio listed off the numbers of unionists murdered in colombia like he was reading a report on the weather channel
1552469 our overwhelming conclusion is that a free trade agreement will not help the colombian people
1552470 colombia continues to be the most dangerous country on earth for trade unions and civil society activists we have also observed that colombia has no juridical framework that permits free collective bargaining
1552471 from what we have learned 95 percent of colombian workers do not have an enforceable collective agreement
1552472 we cannot accept a free trade agreement until this changes
1552473 it is easier to form a paramilitary gang than it is to form a trade union in this country
1552474 trade and investment and will help solidify ongoing efforts by the government of colombia to create a more prosperous equitable and secure democracy
1552475 in colombias current climate increased foreign investment will not lift all boats
1552476 colombia is offering canada an fta because it really wants the u s congress to reconsider its opposition to such a deal
1552477 we are not clear where this legislation will go in canada
1552478 colombia imposes tariffs averaging 11 percent on industrial goods 17 percent on agricultural and 15 to 20 percent on cotton yarns and paper products
1552479 the proposed agreement would benefit companies and workers in a wide range of industries including the automotive sector steel chemicals public infrastructure development oil drilling mining and advanced manufacturing such as mining machinery and equipment
1552480 we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
1552481 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel
1552482 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1552483 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1552484 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1552485 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1552486 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1552487 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1552488 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1552489 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1552490 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1552491 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1552492 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1552493 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1552494 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity

1552499 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad

1552507 any casino thats showing year over year revenue gains in this economy ought to be happy
1552508 if you look on the east coast pennsylvania is doing very well most markets are reporting year over year declines in gross gaming revenue within the gaming industry right now pennsylvanias a good story
1552509 you definitely are seeing casinos impacted by the economy theres no doubt about that but its not universal in terms of the effects
1552510 some of the markets that rely on more of a drive in business have not decreased revenues
1552511 and pennsylvania gaming and slots at tracks are still relatively new concepts there you still might be getting people who are potentially going for the first time
1552512 webbs got that great sinker and the pitchers who can spot that theyre hard to hit

1552515 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on

1552529 thousands of websites have been shuttered while government controls and blocking of sites outside china have intensified significantly in recent months

1552535 youre going to walk it anyway so you may as well enjoy it
1552536 i got a kick out of my mii because it looks like he has a lot of fun on the pitch and hes capable of pulling off some wild moves

1552542 he kicked out the rear window and continued to spit at and on me
1552543 began to strike me on the back and shoulder area

1552549 you wont see a commander on our team with less than 10 years experience on the team it just wouldnt happen

1552555 the shares of seven publicly held newspaper companies today plunged to the ir lowest point in modern history
1552556 for some reason they assume people will want to buy more newspapers if they have less news in them and are less useful
1552557 a self correcting mechanism as subscribers find less and less to read because newspaper staffs are thinned too much to produce quality copy subscriptions will lapse and the ratio will be restored until of course additional layoffs refresh the cycle
1552558 yes you can put out a good paper with 700 staffers but not a better paper than the one paying customers are already fleeing

1552576 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1552577 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago

1552585 psst barack obama is a negro they commit crimes and leave litter on the street and have scarily large penises besides he may be a muslim

1552587 we dont believe in hanging onto a name for the names sake
1552588 im certainly not mike hard from the godbullies anymore im a different person and the musics a different thing when we did godbullies we were all these ideological college kids thats how we all met we all went to western michigan university together and started this band in kalamazoo the music might sound similar because its the same musicians but its a whole different vibe every band ive been in brainsaw thrall we give it a different name because its a different thing i understand when bands cash in on the name but i think its really cheap because its not the same shit
1552589 but were versatile enough musicians and good enough friends that we never get tired of exploring new ideas we do it because its fun
1552590 its definitely the bullies mixed with queen bee it has the psychedelic rock n roll heavy bullies sound but it also has that aggressive rhythm that karens always been known to play shes a very percussive bass player when you put it all together it gives it a really good groove
1552591 the thing i like about it is that both the songwriting and the performance come together in a way that they didnt in the godbullies
1552592 all the parts seem to integrate into the whole and it functions like a seamless machine
1552593 for as much of an oddball as i am detroits been very good to me and im very grateful for that

1552609 paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1552610 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1552611 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1552612 our strategies for dealing with teenage pregnancy need to be focused more on young men and their responsibilities
1552613 committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
1552614 this rebuke from gove will be worn as a badge of honour the equivalent of the cool kid in class getting a ticking off from teacher and the mags to which he has given free publicity will respond with a contemptuous snigger

1552617 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
1552618 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
1552619 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
1552620 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
1552621 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
1552622 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
1552623 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
1552624 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
1552625 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
1552626 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
1552627 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
1552628 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
1552629 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
1552630 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
1552631 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society
1552632 does everything for you the japanese theyre ahead in everything
1552633 people like alison hinds came to trinidad and commanded some great fees in times when our artistes wasnt commanding those fees people like krosfyah people like rupee something like fees is determined by the artistes themselves
1552634 i remember sitting down with my management and devising plans not just to raise our fees but to raise our production and when we raised our production level we received more because it obviously cost more so everything is a growth basis you work your way up through integrity through consistency through product
1552635 i have loved you the most endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you now that im dying will you follow me and keep me company
1552636 i have loved you all my life now that im dying will you follow me and keep me company
1552637 life is too good when you die im going to remarry
1552638 i have always turned to you for help and youve always been there for me when i die will you follow me and keep me company
1552639 at the very most i can only send you to your grave
1552640 ill leave with you and follow you no matter where you go
1552641 i should have taken much better care of you when i had the chance
1552642 weve given our writers encouragement and a lot of freedom so the opinions here are theirs not the companys

1552649 quiero aclararles que no existe ning n informe de la sigen recuerden que los que pedimos que sta sindicatura intervenga en esta cuesti n de la universidad fuimos el rector por aldo caballero y yo
1552650 fue dif cil pero tuvimos que sacarle a montini el apoyo pol tico y pedirle la renuncia
1552651 le solicitamos la renuncia por cuestiones que no tienen que ver solo con el autopago sino con otros problemas internos que hubo en la unam
1552652 en absoluto fue un acto de neta responsabilidad del vicerrector decisiones que l tom en forma errada y que para nosotros colmaron la paciencia esta fue una decisi n muy debatida en el seno de la agrupaci n y se decidi tomar el toro por las astas y pedirle la renuncia
1552653 la reuni n fue positiva y pudimos plantearles las necesidades del sector esperamos poder continuar con las conversaciones para poder encontrar soluciones para los problemas que nos afectan
1552654 los cr ditos no alcanzar n para cubrir todos los secaderos existentes en la provincia y el incumplimiento de precios est muy extendido en la zona norte y centro ante este problema la soluci n es la implementaci n de un mecanismo que concentre toda la producci n y que s lo la venda con los precios oficiales
1552655 en misiones hay 38 secaderos cooperativos y cerca de 140 establwecimientos no integrados de esta cantidad muy pocos reciben los dos pesos fijados por la canchada y por lo tanto tampoco pueden cumplir con los 52 centavos para la hoja verde por esta raz n si se crea el mercado consignatario como exist a antes se podr garantizar los precios oficiales
1552656 el inym no est pudiendo garantizar los precios y el mercado puede ser la soluci n sino para qu fijamos precios si no se van a cumplir
1552657 volvimos a pedir que se unifiquen los impuestos de los secaderos integrados los particulares y los cooperativos porque las diferencias son importantes
1552658 pensamos que tendremos todo listo para fin de a o o los primeros d as de enero de 2009 el desembolso que realizamos y seguiremos haciendo all equipara a cualquier inversi n hotelera del lugar es una suma importante de dinero porque queremos que las cosas se hagan bien para brindar lo mejor a nuestros clientes

1552663 said all the right things which israelis wanted to hear
1552664 a lot of picture opportunities mainly for the audience the electorate and the electorate are american jews and americans in general
1552665 the only way to free america is to shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected

1552668 planes rockets cluster and phosphorus bombs for israel to use at will

1552672 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression
1552673 please re think posting material like this we are not interested in an anti israel policy
1552674 the last thing we need is to be aligned with more anti semitic rhetoric jewish conspiracy speculation should be left to the experts at the united nations

1552676 content on blogs in my barackobama represents the opinions of community members and in no way should be interpreted as endorsed or approved by the campaign
1552677 there are further falls in store for precious metals but the bigger picture is that they will come back up again and as equity prices have softened in line with the underlying commodity this is probably a cheap buy

1552679 im a sceptic in the sense of the speed of the actions proposed by the government which are at best a staggering over response to a populist issue im just sick of the doomsday people who say that if we dont act tomorrow we will be dead by next week

1552694 there can be areas of states with dense populations like long island in new york where there is a high incidence of breast cancer but its because there are a great deal of older people or double income no kids couples there or san francisco where theres a population of lesbians who havent had children
1552695 african american women do tend to get breast cancer earlier and get a more virulent form of the disease

1552883 lekas menghatur terima kasih kepada popo yang sudah mengampuni jiwamu
1552884 di pulau kita kau seorang diri tak punya kawan apa tidak baik kalau kita bawa dia ke sana supaya dia bisa menemani kau hanya adatnya tidak begitu bagus
1552885 bagus kita bawa dia ke sana kalau dia membandel bukankah popo bisa mencari jalan untuk menaklukinya
1552886 kau ikut aku lebih dulu kita cari seorang dan aku ingin melakukan suatu pekerjaan sesudah itu kita pulang ke pulau leng coa to
1552887 di pulau kami kau bisa mendapatkan apapun jua makanan yang lezat tempat bermain pemandangan indah yang belum pernah dilihat oleh mu anak baik sudahlah kau jangan rewel dan ikutlah popo
1552888 jangan campur campur urusanku mari mari aku mau lihat mengapa kau belum mati
1552889 nenek itu telah memanggil kau untuk melihat mengapa kau belum mati
1552890 kata si murid yang lalu bangun berdiri dan menghampiri si nenek
1552891 mau pukul boleh pukul lagi biarpun dia mati tak ada sangkut pautnya denganku
1552892 apa kau mau pergi dengan begitu saja tanpa mengeluarkan sepatah perkataan sopan
1552893 pedang ini memang bukan senjata mustika tapi juga bukan besi rongsokan
1552894 kim hoa popo mengapa kau tidak berdiam di pulau leng coa to dan menyateroni wilayah tiong goan
1552895 pendeta itu besar namanya dan ternyata ia memang memiliki kepandaian tinggi
1552896 suami ku sudah meninggal dunia dan di pulau kami aku merasa sangat kesepian maka itu aku pergi pesiar kalau kalau ada seorang hweeshio atau toesoe yang cocok untuk dijadikan kawan
1552897 dulu ilmu pedang kwee siang kwee liehiap leluhur goe bie pay memang telah menggetarkan dunia persilatan
1552898 tapi sesudah turun kepada murid dan cucu muridnya berapa bagian yang masih ketinggalan
1552899 biarpun hanya ketinggalan sebagian tapi sudah cukup untuk menyapu bersih segala kawanan siluman
1552900 pedang itu pedang muridku dan ternyata tidak cukup kuat untuk menahan seranganmu
1552901 boe lim cie coen po to to liong hauw leng thia hee boh kam poet ciong ie thian poet coet swee ie ceng hong
1552902 kalau begitu ie thian kiam jatuh ke dalam tangan go bie pay
1552903 begitu terhunus pedang tidak boleh dimasukkan kedalam sarungnya lagi sebelum minum darah
1552904 nenek itu tidak bisa melihat gunung thaysan dan sudah berani bertempur melawan soehoe sekarang dia baru tahu kelihaian soehoe
1552905 di kemudian hari begitu lekas mendengar suara batuk batuknya kamu mesti lekas lekas menyingkir
1552906 perempuan she teng itu sangat jahat dan dia pasti akan coba mencelakakan kie kouwkouw peristiwa dimalam itu telah disaksikan olehku dan pihak yang bersalah adalah si perempuan she teng biarlah kalau dia bicara yang tidak tidak aku akan maju untuk membela kie kouwkouw
1552907 soe moay dalam partai kita apakah bunyinya larangan ke tiga
1552908 dilarang berpihak kepada orang luar dan mengkhianati rumah perguruan sendiri
1552909 soehoe dalam hal ini ada sesuatu yang sukar dikatakan olehku
1552910 di sini tak ada orang luar kau bicaralah terus terang
1552911 soehoe pada enam tahun berselang soe hoe telah memerintahkan kami delapan orang saudara seperguruan turun tangan untuk menyelidiki tempat bersembunyinya cia soen pada suatu hari teecoe murid tiba di tay soe po di tengah jalan teecoe bertemu dengan seorang pria setengah tua usianya kira kira empat puluh tahun yang mengenakan baju putih dia selalu menguntit toecoe teecoe menginap di rumah penginapan dia turut menginap di situ teecoe makan dia makan teecoe jalan ia turut jalan semula teecoe tidak menghiraukannya tapi belakangan karena merasa tak tahan teecoe lalu menegurnya tapi dia menjawab seperti orang otak miring sebab gusar teecoe menghunus pedang lalu menikamnya dia tidak membawa senjata tetapi di luar dugaanku ilmu silatnya amat tinggi dan dalam dua tiga jurus dia sudah merampas senjata teecoe
1552912 kalau begitu kau boleh coba mengikuti dia dan coba menyelidiki ilmu apa yang dimilikinya
1552913 soehoe dia seorang yang belum dikenal bagaimana teecoe bisa mengikutinya
1552914 dengan rupa rupa jalan teecoe coba menyingkirkan diri tapi selalu tidak berhasil
1552915 akhirnya teecoe tertawan teecoe bernasib sial sehingga bertemu dengan musuh penitisan yang lampau
1552916 teecoe tidak bisa melawan dan kehormatan teecoe telah dirusak olehnya
1552917 ia mengawasi tee coe dengan sangat keras sehingga percobaan teecoe untuk bunuh diri selalu gagal beberapa bulan kemudian seorang musuhnya menyatroni dan dengan menggunakan kesempatan itu teecoe baru bisa kabur teecoe hamil tapi tidak berani memberitahukan soehoe dan belakangan teecoe melahirkan seorang anak perempuan dengan diam diam
1552918 biarpun mesti mati berlaksa kali teecoe tak akan berani berdusta
1552919 kasihan siauw hoe kau sangat tidak beruntung dalam hal ini bukan kau yang bersalah
1552920 atas kemauan ayah teecoe telah ditunangkan dengan in liok ya dari boe tong pay
1552921 sesudah kejadian itu pernikahan tak akan dapat dilangsungkan lagi teecoe hanya ingin memohon permisi soehoe supaya teecoe boleh mencukur rambut untuk menjadi pendeta
1552922 apakah dia yo siauw si raja siluman dari agama beng kauw yang menamakan diri sebagai kong beng soe cia
1552923 dia dia kelihatannya mempunyai mempunyai kedudukan tinggi dalam agama itu
1552924 menurut keterangannya dia bertempat tinggai di puncak co bong hong di pegunungan koen loen san
1552925 tempat tinggalnya itu hanya di beritahukan kepada teecoe seorang tiada orang lain yang mengetahuinya soehoe apa dia musuh partai kita
1552926 bukan hanya musuh besar dari partai kita toa soepehmu kouw hung coen cia dan pentolan koen loen pay yoe liong coe mati karena siluman yo siauw
1552927 baiklah kau mempunyai banyak kedosaan menyerahkan diri kepadanya dan melindungi pheng hweeshio berdosa terhadap kakak seperguruan mendustai guru diam diam memelihara anak itu semua bisa diampuni olehku sekarang aku ingin memerintahkan kau melakukan sesuatu tugas sesudah berhasil kau boleh kembali ke go bie san dan aku akan mengangkat kau sebagai ahli waris mewariskan ie thian kiam kepadamu dan kemudian hari kau akan menjadi ciang boenjin dari partai kita
1552928 biarpun mesti masuk ke dalam lautan api teecoe tak akan menolak perintah soehoe
1552929 tapi karena sudah bercacat teecoe tidak berani memikir untuk menjadi seorang ahli waris
1552930 kau mau mengajak aku bermain main di atas gunung bukan
1552931 aku memohon memohon supaya kau mengantarkan poet hwie kepada ayahnya
1552932 ah ouw sinhe dan soe bo tidak terlolos dari tangan kim hoa popo
1552933 sebagai tanda terima kasih kami akan memberi sedikit uang perak
1552934 kambing ini gemuk sekali malam ini kita bisa makan kenyang

1552936 saudara thio kau juga berada di sini mengapa orang itu
1552937 celaka sungguh mereka mau coba makan kami berdua untung juga aku berhasil merobohkannya
1552938 lima hari lima malam tak pernah menelan sebutir nasi hanya gegares kulit pohon dan rumput hmmm
1552939 jikalau bisa mendapatkan sebutir beras dalam jarak lima ratus li di sekitar tempat ini kau betul betul pintar
1552940 kamu manusia manusia yang menamakan diri sendiri sebagai orang orang rimba persilatan tapi mau melakukan perbuatan terkutuk itu sungguh memalukan apa kamu tidak merasa malu menjadi manusia sehina itu
1552941 kau sudah mengobati lukaku dan di dalam hatimu kau sekarang pasti sedang mengutuki aku
1552942 kamu membalas kebaikan dengan kejahatan kalau tidak ditolong aku sekarang kamu sudah berada dilobang kubur
1552943 kau sudah menolong kami dan untuk itu kami merasa berhutang budi tapi sekaranq kami sedang menghadapi kebinasaan karena lapar kalau mau menolong kau harus menolong sampai diakhirnya dan kamu sekarang sekali lagi kami memerlukan pertolonganmu
1552944 aku adalah murid boe tong sedang adikku muid go bie pay kebinasaan kami berdua tidak menjadi soal tapi apakah kamu kira lima pendekar boe tong dan biat coat soetbay akan menyudahi perbuatanmu dengan begitu saja
1552945 kejadian di hari ini diketahui oleh langit oleh bumi oleh kau dan oleh aku bocah sesudah kau berada dalam perut kami kau boleh mengatakan kepada thio sam hong
1552946 saudara thio untuk menolong jiwa kami sesungguhnya tak dapat berbuat lain
1552947 mengapa kamu berdiri seperti patung pergi ambil air dan cari kayu bakar
1552948 jikalau kalian mau juga makan daging manusia makanlah dagingku saja seorang aku memohon supaya kamu suka membebaskan adik kecil itu kalau permintaanku dilulusi biarpun mati aku tak akan merasa menyesal
1552949 karena pada waktu mau menutup mata ibunya telah meminta pertolonganku supaya aku mengantarkan dia kepada ayahnya
1552950 kan toaya dengan makan aku seorang kurasa kamu sudah cukup kenyang dan besok kamu bisa membeli kerbau atau kambing untuk dijadikan barang santapan selaajutnya kan toaya sie toaya ampunilah adikku itu
1552951 tapi kalau rahasia ini bocor di kemudian hari kite berabe sekali song wan kiauw jie lian coe dan yang lain lain tentu akan cari kita wan toako jika kau mempunyai jalan untuk menghadapi mereka aku tidak berkeberatan
1552952 aku sungguh tolol aku tidak memikir apa yang mungkin terjadi di hari kemudian
1552953 kau bersumpahlah bahwa kau tak akan menceritakan kejadian di hari ini kepada siapapun jua
1552954 cie siauw sie kalau mau turut makan daging kambing kau harus bekerja
1552955 kita adalah orang orang kangouw yang harus mempunyai rasa kesatriaan
1552956 apa kamu tidak merasa malu kalau kamu mencelakakan anak kecil itu
1552957 saudara thio jangan takut aku pergi untuk mengambil bala bantuan
1552958 siapa tahu dia orang baik atau orang jahat menurut katanya dia she cie bernama tat kau jangan percaya omongannya sekarang sudah hampir malam dari mana dia mau mengambil bala bantuan
1552959 biarpun dia membawa semua penduduk kampung kita tidak usah takut
1552960 ha ha jangankan berkelahi berjalanpun mereka sudah tak mampu hayolah aku sudah kuat menahan rasa lapar
1552961 thats the potential other end of the spectrum when youre never tied to anybody or anything i run the risk of losing touch with the people in my life that mean the most to me because i have made the decision to live like this
1552962 betapa pun suhu bermaksud mencelakai aku tetap takkan kulupakan budi kebaikannya selama mendidik aku 20 an tahun dengan sendirinya aku sendiri tak dapat membunuhnya namun anak murid hing san pay yang berhasrat menuntut balas juga tak dapat kurintangi hanya saja ilmu silat suhu sekarang sudah lain daripada dahulu betapa pun gi jing dan lain lain berlatih rasanya selama hidup mereka ini juga tak mampu mengalahkan suhuku beberapa jurus ilmu pedang yang kuajarkan kepada mereka itu pun terang bukan tandingan pi sia kiam hoat
1552963 ya bangsat benar kapan dilakukannya hal ini mengapa tiada seorang pun yang tahu
1552964 eh mereka ini kan bukan jago lemah mengapa kena diselomoti orang tanpa menjengek sedikit pun
1552965 kiranya secara diam diam sudah ada orang kosen yang telah membongkar muslihat mereka alangkah baiknya jika sekiranya aku tidak perlu turun tangan sendiri
1552966 yu heng entah cara bagaimana kalian berdelapan kena diselomoti orang dapatkah kau menceritakan
1552967 sungguh memalukan bila dikatakan semalam cayhe tidur dengan sangat nyenyak entah mengapa tahu tahu hiat to sudah tertutuk orang dan tergantung tinggi di atas pohon ini bangsat yang menyelomoti kami itu besar kemungkinan memakai obat bius dan sebagainya kalau tidak diriku yang tidak becus sih lumrah tapi tokoh tokoh yang serbacerdas tangkas sebagai giok leng tojin thio hujin dan lain lain ini masakah juga kena diselomoti orang
1552968 untung sekali hari ini tho kok lak koay tidak berada di sini kalau mereka di sini tentu urusan akan tambah ramai
1552969 dari mana kau tahu mereka tidak berada di sini keenam orang itu suka gila gilaan bukan mustahil apa yang terjadi ini adalah perbuatan mereka
1552970 meski ilmu silat tho kok lak sian cukup tinggi namun isi perut mereka sangat terbatas
1552971 jangankan mereka tidak mampu menulis kalimat kalimat itu untuk menulis dua huruf muslihat keji saja kutanggung mereka tidak bisa
1552972 aneh sungguh aneh lekas kemari coba lihat apa lagi itu
1552973 ada sesuatu yang membingungkan maka cayhe ingin minta keterangan kepada kalian coba terangkan sesungguhnya kalian berdua telah ikut serta dalam muslihat rahasia apa hal inilah yang ingin diketahui oleh para kawan kita
1552974 muslihat kakek moyangnya tujuh belas turunan muslihat maknya anak kura kura
1552975 habis kalian ditutuk oleh siapa siapa tentu boleh kau jelaskan urusan
1552976 tadi kami sedang jalan jalan di sini tahu tahu punggung ditutuk orang lalu tak bisa berkutik keparat kalau benar laki laki sejati seharusnya berkelahi dari depan main sergap hm macam kesatria apa bangsat
1552977 cuma urusan ini sudah terbongkar kukira akan gagal dikerjakan bagi kita semua hendaklah berlaku waspada saja
1552978 mereka tidak mau mengaku terus terang biarkan mereka tinggal di sini saja biarkan lapar tiga hari tiga malam supaya tahu rasa
1552979 jika kau membebaskan mereka jangan jangan orang kosen itu akan marah padamu dan kau sendiri yang akan digantung di atas pohon kan bisa runyam
1552980 eh saudara saudara bukan cayhe tidak mau menolong kalian soalnya cayhe sendiri juga merasa takut
1552981 put kay taysu bersifat lucu dan lugu biasanya tiada sengketa apa apa pada lain orang mengapa dia pun digantung orang di atas pohon tentu ada orang sengaja main gila padanya untuk menangkap put kay rasanya tidak mungkin dilakukan oleh seorang saja besar kemungkinan adalah tho kok lak sian
1552982 manusia yang paling doyan perempuan laki laki berhati palsu nomor satu di dunia ini
1552983 manusia yang tidak becus bekerja orang yang paling sembrono nomor satu di dunia ini
1552984 cara pasang kedua pita itu keliru tempat mestinya kedua pita itu harus tukar tempat antara put kay hwesio dan dian pek kong mana bisa put kay hwesio dikatakan manusia yang paling doyan perempuan orang yang paling doyan perempuan harus dialamatkan kepada dian pek kong sedangkan sebutan orang paling sembrono masih boleh juga diberikan kepada put kay dia tidak pantang membunuh tidak pantang makan dan minum segala apa pun dia gegares sesudah menjadi hwesio juga berani cari nikoh sebagai istri perbuatannya memang sembrono cuma sebutan tidak becus bekerja rasanya rada janggal dan entah apa maksudnya
1552985 kebetulan saja kita disergap lawan kita harus menemukan keparat itu dan mencincang dia
1552986 kita digantung di sini adalah sebagai ganjaran atas dosa kita kau kau berani sekali masakah kau hendak membunuh orang
1552987 nenek moyangnya begini banyak nyamuknya bisa bisa darahku akan terisap habis nyamuk busuk nyamuk bangsat terkutuklah delapan belas keturunan nenek moyangmu
1552988 nyamuk kok cuma menggigit kau dan tidak menggigit diriku entah apa sebabnya
1552989 ya aku lebih suka darahku berbau daripada digigit beratus ratus nyamuk sekaligus
1552990 bila aku dapat bergerak dengan bebas lagi orang pertama yang akan kucari untuk bikin perhitungan adalah keh bu si si bangsat itu akan kututuk juga hiat tonya lalu kugigit pahanya akan kumakan daging pahanya itu sedikit demi sedikit
1552991 kalau aku lebih suka makan daging para nikoh cilik itu kulitnya halus dagingnya putih tentu jauh lebih lezat dan gurih
1552992 tapi gak siansing telah menyatakan para nikoh itu tidak boleh dimakan harus ditangkap ke hoa san
1552993 jumlah nikoh cilik itu ada beratus ratus kalau kita makan dua tiga orang di antaranya masakah bisa ketahuan
1552994 kau tidak mau makan nikoh boleh terserah mengapa memaki orang
1552995 well i need to spare the polo shirts when we travel this weekend
1552996 we are going to kl this weekend no need to take so many shirts
1552997 to celebrate this new era in the high definition viewing experience dish network is offering subscribers a special deal in august to enjoy the unparalleled picture and sound of 1080p high definition programming
1552998 y qu significa pues que ya est pr cticamente listo para lanzarlo oficialmente el d a ste enlace pod is encontrar las im genes del dvd de ubuntu mucho m s completo
1552999 the boys were childish they didnt read papers and werent interested in anything
1553000 and the girls only talked about shopping and what they were going to do on friday night
1553001 in poland you have to know the names of all countries even the rivers but in england hardly anyone could place kenya or poland on the map the teachers didnt test knowledge only effort
1553002 here in lodz i go to debates i talk about films and i try to persuade people not to use plastic bags during the elections here we posted flyers for my neighbour who was out campaigning
1553003 but in newcastle no one cared about globalisation the greenhouse effect the eu war or politics
1553004 maybe its because they get everything on a plate because there was no communism there and theres no real poverty they dont need to worry about their future
1553005 in poland parents tell their children about financial problems but in britain i think they dont have them or they tried to hide them to buy their children everything
1553006 in poland i only ever got average marks in maths yet in the uk teachers said i was a genius
1553007 after a year i was top of the class in everything and that includes english
1553008 they would give me a list of terms and definitions the teacher told us to put them into pairs and colour them the right colour like at primary school
1553009 we know that polish pupils are better at acquiring facts and knowledge
1553010 perhaps because we are poorer and we dont have such great facilities in poland pupils are more motivated to seek out possibilities for themselves
1553011 every child and parent has the right to choose the education they wish
1553012 we are disappointed that this pupil has decided to move away
1553013 only weeks ago st thomas more was recognised by ofsted as being an outstanding school with 82 per cent of students achieving five or more a c grades among those 16 came out with nine or more a a grades
1553014 the long term trend we see is that sport inspired fashion focused shoes are taking over market share from more functional shoes
1553015 clearly this is a trend that is here to stay and will be a primary driver of growth in the european sport industry
1553016 the air jordan franchise created the most coveted basketball footwear in the world and changed the basketball landscape forever
1553017 like every kid growing up i dreamed of making winning shots at the buzzer and i was fortunate to live out that dream but never in my wildest dreams did i ever entertain the idea of the success of the air jordan franchise
1553018 athletes had been endorsing products for years prior to this
1553019 but they were just signing their name to the shoe i think there was a very understandable difference michaels personality and even the changes in the game and inspiration from other walks of life were all sort of being designed into this product and that made it more interesting
1553020 the beginning of the jordan era marked a new and more sophisticated approach to leveraging an athlete
1553021 the air jordan franchise created the most coveted basketball footwear in the world and changed the basketball landscape forever
1553022 like every kid growing up i dreamed of making winning shots at the buzzer and i was fortunate to live out that dream but never in my wildest dreams did i ever entertain the idea of the success of the air jordan franchise
1553023 athletes had been endorsing products for years prior to this
1553024 but they were just signing their name to the shoe i think there was a very understandable difference michaels personality and even the changes in the game and inspiration from other walks of life were all sort of being designed into this product and that made it more interesting
1553025 the beginning of the jordan era marked a new and more sophisticated approach to leveraging an athlete
1553026 our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream
1553027 weve always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own our people are losing that faith not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy
1553028 in little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof
1553029 back then we imported about a third of our oil now we import more than half
1553030 will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the worlds oil wells
1553031 our excessive dependence on opec has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people
1553032 these efforts will cost money a lot of money and that is why congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay it will be money well spent unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil these funds will be paid by americans to americans
1553033 i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now
1553034 in just ten years these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east
1553035 i am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one half by the end of the next decade
1553036 think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents
1553037 just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win world war ii so will we mobilize american determination and ability to win the energy war
1553038 ill also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power solar power and geothermal energy
1553039 i am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nations history to develop americas own alternative sources of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant products for gasohol from unconventional gas from the sun
1553040 think about when the scientists and engineers told john f kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon he told them they would find a way
1553041 we ourselves are the same americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon
1553042 we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 percent more efficient over the next four years
1553043 im asking congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that our nations utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels especially coal our most abundant energy source
1553044 and well invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal americas most abundant energy source
1553045 i will do my best but i will not do it alone let your voice be heard whenever you have a chance say something good about our country
1553046 decline in obamas numbers has halted and has possibly begun to reverse itself
1553047 the first time mccain has enjoyed even a statistically insignificant advantage of any sort since obama clinched the democratic nomination on june 3
1553048 these groups and individuals view the proper role of government as taking things from one group and giving them to someone else money power and control who are they in favor of taking it from you and me the taxpayers
1553049 the religious right is best understood as a parents rights movement that fears state interference in the family just as small businessmen fear regulatory burdens taxpayers fear the growing tax take and gun owners fear politicians calling for gun control
1553050 these parents of faith will fight to control what is taught to their children in their schools they will not cross the street to go after folks in san francisco who behave oddly
1553051 they do not want the government to give them something or take something from others
1553052 like many cities on our list the canton massillon area has been victim to the decline of the so called rust belt
1553053 only pittsburgh and new orleans have seen sharper population declines this decade and new orleans was because of a natural disaster

1553064 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1553065 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well

1553090 before there was no way for the moderators to go in there with a follow up question

1553093 kita sudah mensosialisasikan ke sekolah tapi belum semuanya bisa menerapkan
1553094 kita belum tahu buku apa saja yang bisa didownload dan situsnya apa

1553164 i wanted to run the 100 not just the 200
1553165 my coach told me if i broke the national record for the 200 i could run a 100
1553166 it looked like his knees were going past my face
1553167 it almost seemed like usain had another turbo gear that he hadnt unleashed yet like it was a 120 meter race
1553168 but he didnt have any interest in doing the work for the 400
1553169 he trained more diligently in practice when he began running the times were no surprise
1553170 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up

1553180 its a dark unlit road theres only one light in the area
1553181 we dont believe he was dead when he was struck
1553182 its not uncommon for people to be coming through here at 60 65 miles per hour
1553183 weve had 18 practices so far and they mean a lot but the games mean a lot too
1553184 well all see how everybody does on thursday and thatll be where theyre getting hit and situations change from play to play
1553185 i think just getting a little bit of work like today starting to move forward is going to be a big plus for me

1553195 this incident could have ended up very differently due to the dangerous river conditions
1553196 were glad this incident in manchester had a fortunate outcome but we cant stress enough the need for people to be aware of the dangerous conditions in new hampshires rivers right now
1553197 its obviously important for us to provide meals that are affordable and nutritious but i dont think its the school boards responsibility to serve lunches at a loss
1553198 we have eight food service employees who get health benefits
1553199 until we can change their status from full time to part time through attrition theres nothing we can really do about it
1553200 theoretically the school lunch program is self supportive but we are experiencing the same challenges that families are
1553201 it might be something were faced with for a number of years
1553202 but were not alone other districts are experiencing the same thing
1553203 huge gorgeous trees my insurance wont cover this how am i going to clean this
1553204 trees that blew over with roots intact will last a year before insects and stain render them unusable
1553205 broken trees may only last a month but many of them may remain sound longer depending on the conditions
1553206 these are experienced foresters who can help landowners determine if they have trees that are still valuable that could be sold or a mess that will cost money to clean up they can also inform people about contracts and laws
1553207 we always suggest people ask for references before engaging any kind of contractor
1553208 they had a product on july 23 and by july 26 they had debris that needs to be cleaned up
1553209 thats a big blow it would mean its on all of us to try and fix it because hes had three or four big plays every day in practice

1553214 theres tremendous pressure to go along to be the good ole boy
1553215 the famous mr gandrud goes to washington did not sit well
1553216 we sold the gastric band thats proven to be a gold mine a big rubber band inside your stomach that makes you feel full
1553217 chamber of commerce people who believed the city had been too heavy handed with business
1553218 i dont think that keeping a small town atmosphere and having some economic growth are incompatible
1553219 thats a tough one the conventional wisdom is thats not a district that greg can win
1553220 it was the little cool store we didnt call them independent stores back then but thats what it was
1553221 but the best part of a store like that had nothing to do with its size it was the kind of place where the people knowledgeable in music could tell you what was new
1553222 i tried to make the place presentable too not like some of these really funky little stores it was clean like a corporate store but stocked like an indie
1553223 did you see that movie high fidelity the way they made wisecracks about the customers i didnt want to have that happen in morninglory
1553224 when i managed the i v store youd have somebody coming in every two weeks who said they burned the bank
1553225 what i liked about it was that it seemed like such a santa barbara place
1553226 people behind the counter with long hair always very helpful without pressuring you i loved going in there
1553227 in the 90s i used to go in there every day after work the stock was vibrant back then
1553228 it was fun and people liked it then about a year ago the rumors started going around that the place was going out of business
1553229 and we had a show and it was christmas and there were only a few people there and suddenly i realized how bad things had become
1553230 people in the age group of 18 to 25 just arent buying music anymore
1553231 what people euphemistically call file sharing i call file stealing
1553232 it really amounts to the distribution and receiving of stolen property
1553233 they find out about cds there then go home and download them
1553234 its a shame that it had to end like this
1553235 its sad because ill miss having knowledgeable people available people who were so happy to be lucky enough to work in a record store these are places like galleries or restaurants where people gather those are feelings that are lost and i dont think you can get them back from a computer
1553236 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chap stick
1553237 ill wear it when i ride my bike or scooter
1553238 theres a lot of people here helping to keep us safe its wonderful that theyre here
1553239 that part really got to me because it reminded me of the things i was missing outside
1553240 i felt like it was nine and a half years
1553241 the directors they worked with said they were better than a lot of college students
1553242 they said they have very good yes muscles that theyre not afraid to try new things
1553243 the only thing i ask of anybody ever is that they have passion presence and a desire to be here with us
1553244 just tell the story tell the story with passion tell it with focus and tell it honestly
1553245 for so many people out there everything revolves around beach volleyball
1553246 when im home my schedule works around the kids dropping them off at school in the morning and picking them up in the afternoon

1553264 people have a strong idea of what under armour is
1553265 so when we built the store we really tried to make it the physical manifestation of the brand
1553266 they are also very worried about the weakness in the economy
1553267 im still cautiously optimistic we wont slip into a recession
1553268 the economy should start to grow again next year well muddle through
1553269 this case is a reminder that computer crimes are not confined within national borders
1553270 with the worldwide reach of the internet criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the globe
1553271 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat

1553303 as a distributed system the different components of s3 need to be aware of the state of each other for example this awareness makes it possible for the system to decide which redundant physical storage server to route a request to
1553304 we experienced a problem with those internal system communications leaving the components unable to interact properly and customers unable to successfully process requests after exploring several alternatives the team determined it had to take the service offline to restore proper communication and then bring service online again these are sophisticated systems and it generally takes a while to get to root cause in such a situation

1553383 as far as i know theres no problem with that why would this need a
1553384 i have complete faith in what captain anil kumble can do
1553385 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1553386 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1553387 every guy is aware if he is not fully focussed for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1553388 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 per cent in galle
1553389 but the important thing is there is a real awareness about things to achieve in the next test and we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders they can match the best in the world
1553390 look forward to considering the report it has recently provided on consumer representation arrangements going forward
1553391 this is an important step in the process towards a stronger unified consumer voice strong and effective consumer representation is paramount for a vibrant and competitive telecommunications market

1553393 your two asses are getting handed to you tonight and somebodys getting their hair cut
1553394 my sort of suggestion was that we should focus on 2020 olympic games obviously its a nice fit with the term twenty20 but i think its going to take a bit of time and serious thought rather than just rush into it so lets just throw it out there see what support there is around the world
1553395 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1553396 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1553397 its not a bad idea i suppose its a international sport a global sport maybe it takes too long maybe the 20 over version would be a good one
1553398 weve got to investigate getting into new areas as a sport and i think becoming part of the olympic movement is going to enhance that and twenty20 is a perfect vehicle to getting there and bring that forward
1553399 ease the burden to its customers caused by increasing fuel prices
1553400 between january and july natural gas prices increased almost 70 percent from 7 93 to 13 45 per mmbtu
1553401 with half of texas electricity coming from natural gas generators the increased fuel costs have a tremendous impact on electricity costs
1553402 kpubs power costs for july and august have increased over 120 percent from previous months
1553403 typically a home in the subdivision costs between 85 000 and 105 000 to build
1553404 but because of the topography on these six lots it would cost at least 110 000 to build the most basic house
1553405 not everyone can afford a 110 000 loan but this assistance should help bring that loan amount down
1553406 im hoping to use 10 000 per unit which will help six people through the program
1553407 the housing market in kerr county has unfortunately outpaced the income of some residents
1553408 these funds will help families overcome the biggest obstacle many homebuyers face meeting the down payment and closing cost requirements
1553409 besides helping to strengthen families and neighborhoods these funds will help generate local construction jobs and increase area employment opportunities
1553410 were proud to help our nonprofit partners and contribute to an improved quality of life for residents of kerrville
1553411 right now we are hoping to find more affordable lots in the city
1553412 we need more affordable land so we can continue helping families build affordable houses through our program
1553413 once we know the amounts the insurance is covering we will be able to assess the options
1553414 we understand that the decision to rebuild is the answer many desire to know

1553423 rafael van der vaart es la primera incorporaci n de este a o y seguramente la nica consideramos que la plantilla es de mucha calidad de mucho talento un equipo que es una gran familia muy unida
1553424 rafael van der vaart s lo tiene 25 a os y desde los 17 juega en primera divisi n primero en el ajax y luego en el hamburgo ha ganado dos ligas una copa y una supercopa y es a decir de los t cnicos un jugador de extraordinaria calidad un medio defensivo que marca goles y que nos va a ayudar mucho esta temporada
1553425 dijimos que las incorporaciones ser an muy pocas y muy buenas era l gico despu s de que estos dos a os de xitos en los que se han incorporado 19 jugadores j venes y comprometidos era una exigencia de esta junta directiva
1553426 aqu han jugado los mejores del mundo tu vas a ser uno de ellos ser una gran experiencia es un club exigente donde juega gente muy comprometida y entregada te deseo lo mejor y esperamos que te sientas como en casa
1553427 la acci n de la junta va contra el beneficio de la naci n y pone en riesgo la seguridad de millares de estadounidenses que viajan y viven en el extranjero

1553432 whats really interesting is that america has had to step into every war clean it up and end it and never ever did they start it
1553433 as long as we look at ourselves and ask the question who are we are we the country that is somehow or another mired in a war that cannot be won or are we the country of free men that free mans mind and that have freed millions of people in the last hundred years alone are we losers or are we people who change the world
1553434 people are dying in the desert to have just a small piece of what we take for granted every day
1553435 how can it not be worth fighting for we just have to recognize it and remember who we are we are the ones who will take us to new places beyond our wildest imaginations it will be hard and rough but oh well have this tale to tell

1553450 a record percentage of the nations housing inventory is in foreclosure
1553451 so why are most lenders limiting the number of loans made to investors to only four houses and why is the federal housing administration limiting its loans to owner occupants when investor groups could immediately use these loans to acquire repair and resell properties that have been foreclosed on
1553452 our hope is that these panelists will stimulate the kind of innovative thinking thats needed to help lenders and government regulators ease the nations foreclosure crisis

1553456 we are very proud and honored with pfizers decision to locate one of its newest and most promising engines of growth the biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center in our dynamic diversified world class life science cluster at mission bay the selection of mission bay is a testament to its unique attributes as an immensely rich and fertile environment for leading edge scientific discovery a highly sophisticated pool of management talent and an extremely strong and smart capital base
1553457 alexandrias pioneering strategic approach is to create and foster the dynamic growth of life science clusters that bring together in a highly collaborative fashion prestigious academic institutions established emerging and dynamic commercial entities and support their ability to rapidly translate critical health care discoveries which benefit humankind today the strategic imperative for creating value in the research and development realm is clearly based on collaborations and partnerships rather than isolated at internally focused remote campuses mission bay exemplifies these positive attributes in an extraordinary fashion
1553458 we are delighted with pfizers decision to join its life science colleagues at this most important cluster location at mission bay pfizers strategic vision will strengthen the efforts of the many people and entities it interacts with as well as provide a durable platform for its future success
1553459 we have worked closely with the san francisco redevelopment agency and the city of san francisco in the development of these class a office laboratory facilities which offer alexandrias unique proprietary products this strategy has yielded tremendous success and has infused the private sector squarely into the highly interactive and collaborative scientific commercialization effort so easily evident at mission bay

1553521 i look at todays charts at the women who are selling the most records getting the most column inches and im terrified by how they are all controlled by a male corporate idea of what women and rebels should be when christina aguilera is taken seriously as a rebellious figure we have a huge problem

1553525 but i dont want to be such a hassle for him i know he loves me and will try whatever i ask but i also know hell hate it and feel put upon
1553526 you dont know that and its not fair of you to assume
1553527 this is going to require me to open me up and even though its not his fault i always end up hurt when we talk about this he sits there and lets me ramble on and barely responds at all
1553528 thats because this is not his thing he cant help it that hes not quivering with joy at the prospect of another awkward conversation about dd but that doesnt mean he doesnt want to meet your needs

1553544 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1553545 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1553546 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake

1553564 la seguridad no debe ser un tema para las consignas partidistas la seguridad es un deber del estado una responsabilidad de las autoridades y no el tema en que se pretendan dirimir rencillas electorales

1553581 playing for coach carroll is a bit different because he just isnt a normal aau coach but its like starting college two years early
1553582 he treats us the same way he would treat his teams in college or the nba everyone says stuff like wow it must be awful playing for him but i have really enjoyed it he has really helped me with all parts of my game and has just helped me out in many different parts of life
1553583 probably my versatility being able to play and guard multiple positions on the floor

1553585 i like hsm because its a simple fun thing to watch with hsm its all in front of me in song and dance i am lazy to imagine how life can be perfect and uncomplicated
1553586 i love the songs i know all the lyrics by heart because they are so catchy
1553587 its amazing the parents are watching the movie every day with their kids over and over again
1553588 when they bring their kids to the show we realised that they know the songs better than the kids they sing along as well
1553589 we used all the moves from the actual movie and had chucky klapow who was the choreographer for both movies work very closely with cindy stuart the ice skating choreographer to translate it perfectly onto the ice
1553590 doing the show on ice added a whole new dynamic to it in the movie everything is in one spot on the ice you can add speed and power behind it it makes it more thrilling
1553591 its a big responsibility to play our characters because everybody knows what they are like and how they behave on screen

1553601 it shows that singaporeans are open and that they recognise that women can be leaders and capable and why not

1553614 the main thing is that it minimizes the impact on the family it allows them to work with ice and work with the family and make arrangements
1553615 they avoid being arrested at their home or at their business they avoid detention
1553616 ices scheduled departure program gives you time to make arrangements and take care of personal matters it is a way for you to plan your return home
1553617 this is a silly idea anybody that wants to self deport can self deport they just drive across the border or hop on a plane
1553618 its another one of these fantasy ideas of the political season
1553619 the vast majority of immigrants are trying to stay in the u s because they have american citizen children they have homes and they have jobs theyve been working at for years
1553620 what person in their right mind would self deport nobody will participate
1553621 people have children who are u s citizens theyll be left alone

1553634 ive spent a great deal of time recently studying this issue ive read what the people on the one side of the issue say and ive read what the people on the other side say ive read the scholars and the theologians and all sorts of others on this subject but then in the end i decided to get back to the bible and just take it for what it really says
1553635 when we hear people say they are just going to tell us what the bible means it is not true
1553636 i mean the mao caps and che shirts are cool and all
1553637 and is notorious for picketing funerals of gay men who died of aids
1553638 the pastor phelps project is a tacky bit of filthy sodomite propaganda with no literary merit and zero redeeming social value masquerading as legitimate theatre

1553643 the standards are getting higher and yet were getting a higher number of students meeting proficiency
1553644 overall we are encouraged by the growth weve seen in the students from last year
1553645 regardless we need to keep our eye on the prize
1553646 but when it comes to child abuse we need to be a bit more cynical
1553647 we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the child and make the child abuse report
1553648 the worst that could happen is the child is dead
1553649 would not have suffered the further injuries that nearly killed her and left her in the state she is today
1553650 her care wont get any easier as she gets older she wont get any better this is not going to get any easier
1553651 overall we had 200 students more who werent proficient the previous year

1553698 fiercely and consistently supported district 26 and southern arizona against the power brokers in maricopa county

1553700 don is recognized as a strong pro life candidate by well that is not quite the whole story so to quote a veteran newscaster here is the rest of the story
1553701 emelec no ha tenido en todo el a o una identidad
1553702 no ha tenido en todo el a o una identidad
1553703 emelec no ha tenido en todo el a o una identidad futbol stica como se costumbre el baj n de muchos los lesionados que tuvimos
1553704 al principio se lo vio al equipo como que bamos a hacer una campa a muy buena la delantera era muy movediza
1553705 el emelec se ha caracterizado mucho por las bandas con carlos qui nez y jos aguirre han sido parte del baj n que todo jugador pasa por abc motivo todo jugador lo tiene carlos se lesion y los que estuvieron en el puesto de l no llenaron las expectativas hasta yo tuve que jugar de lateral
1553706 hubieron jugadores lesionados algunos que no alcanzaron su nivel hab an partidos buenos malos eso fue la causante de que emelec que siempre es protagonista no se lo ha visto emelec es un equipo agresivo y tambi n pasa m s por la actitud de querer superarse tambi n
1553707 al igual que todos estamos tristes por la separaci n as de un t cnico con much sima experiencia est bamos aprovechando lo que l sabia pero los resultados fueron fundamentales tambi n para que la dirigencia tome esta decisi n
1553708 tenemos que pensar en todo lo posible primero en estar en lo que el profe quiere comprometernos m s y el que est dentro de la cancha darle duro para sacar al emelec
1553709 el panorama hasta ahora tenemos que meditar en que hay que hacer bien estos seis partidos que nos quedan s tenemos la ilusi n todav a
1553710 el partido es fecha fifa y vamos a contar con todos los jugadores que act an en el exterior que ser n citados por el profesor sixto vizuete
1553711 this is very good for the uptown area the city of cincinnati and the university of cincinnati
1553712 when you get a top flight name like hilton involved that brings a lot of credibility to that particular area
1553713 i think with the combination of the university and the local medical center were going to do just fine
1553714 i just drew all the time amp i did it until i didnt need a full time job anymore
1553715 i was on the way over here amp somewhere i saw a p amp an m that i liked amp built the rest of the lettering around that
1553716 i never wrote the same thing twice a lot of people did that and still do write their name for example over amp over but ive always liked how letters could fold into other letters so i wrote different words all the time
1553717 its nice to see the kids be able to come out and not be scared and not hear a gunshot or somebody shooting at them
1553718 weve got to take our kids back they need to grow up were trying to help them grow up
1553719 we need an active engaged development authority to create and attract jobs to the region
1553720 this is about positioning hamilton county and the city of cincinnati as the place to do business in the region
1553721 it really loosens their legislative restrictions so they can go do different deals put more complicated deals together plus do site assemblage and site acquisition
1553722 rick i want debbie you dump her and ill give you cash ten thousand dollars plus a g e toaster over a litton microwave a cuisinart michelin tires brand new a set of sears best metric tools
1553723 i like my women married my willpower weak my wine strong and my saints fallen

1553726 hey youre that secret agent that english secret agent from england
1553727 now i would just like to point out that this film is displaying a distinct tendency to become silly now nobody likes a good laugh more than i do except perhaps my wife and some of her friends oh yes and captain johnson come to think of it most people like a good laugh more than i do but thats beside the point im warning this film not to get silly again right
1553728 boy the next word that comes out of your mouth better be some brilliant fuckin mark twain shit cause its definitely getting chiseled on your tombstone
1553729 what care i for human hearts soft and spiritless as porridge a faeries heart beats fierce and free
1553730 dangerous poor old waldman have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous where should we be if no one tried to find out what lies beyond have your never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars or to know what causes the trees to bud and what changes the darkness into light but if you talk like that people call you crazy well if i could discover just one of these things what eternity is for example i wouldnt care if they did think i was crazy

1553744 yes there is a fire it is a 2 story yellow home and there are people standing outside the fire department is heading inside now
1553745 i am preparing to fight a legend and take him down in his own backyard
1553746 even though i am younger i know hopkins is a slick veteran with a bunch of boxing tricks in his bag i refuse to underestimate him and i know on october 18 he will be ready to fight i am treating this as if it were a championship match with my plan being to remain undefeated and show the world that i am able to take on any fighter regardless of age weight or record
1553747 kelly pavlik has a heart of a lion but he has no idea what he is in for on october 18
1553748 pavlik might be the latest thing on a fast track to fame but i am a sure thing and will take this kid to school that night and teach him a lesson he will never forget
1553749 there is no doubt that bernard hopkins is a great fighter and was virtually unstoppable in his prime but kelly pavlik is recognizably one of the best fighters in boxing today and he will continue to prove his himself against a legendary fighter like bernard this is a tremendous challenge for kelly on october 18

1553751 hopkins has the experience and pavlik has the desire to prove himself i am looking forward to seeing pavlik defend his undefeated record but i know bernard can rise to the occasion and take down one of boxings brightest stars

1553754 this battle of wills between two such accomplished fighters makes pavlik hopkins a very intriguing match up
1553755 crucial difference between taking a life intentionally and allowing a death naturally the first is homicide and the second is a natural death
1553756 every injection pill or new iv bag is designed to cure or to kill to end the pain or the patient
1553757 doctors like anyone else can be selfish and lazy it is not unknown for doctors to take self interested short cuts for example putting a pregnant woman to the added and unnecessary strain of an induced or caesarean section birth on a friday in order to guarantee an uninterrupted weekend for themselves why then would they never be tempted to kill as the quickest or easiest way of dealing with a troublesome case likewise why would they never be prepared to falsify a patients living will
1553758 significant numbers of patients have been told by doctors that they have only months to live and have lived on often with a good quality of life for many years as with capital punishment if you get it wrong its too late
1553759 to solve the problems of the suffering by killing them does not help the next suffering person it sends signals of despair and helplessness it weakens the social prohibition against killing and allows that some lives might not be worth protecting
1553760 my idea of death with dignity is facing it with courage and humor putting one to sleep like a rat is not dignified

1553763 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1553764 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1553765 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1553766 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1553767 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they don t want them now
1553768 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1553769 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium

1553776 im ashamed to be surrounded by people calling themselves liberal who are in my opinion spitting on the graves of brave american soldiers who gave their life to fight a war that wasnt theirs in a country theyve never been to simply to liberate the people therein
1553777 i wasnt born here but i have a love for this country and its people that knows no bounds i will forever be grateful to america for going into world war ii when it had nothing to gain in a country that was far away and rescued my mother from the nazi german concentration camps she is alive and i am alive because of america and if you have a problem with america you have a problem with me

1553785 if you think about the smartest people around you theyre people who ask the best questions theyre not the people who have the answers all the time asking questions everywhere you go is a way to learn a lot and bring a lot to an interview
1553786 the more you can volunteer to do public speaking the better because thats really going to make you feel comfortable in an interview
1553787 just because youre comfortable at doing something doesnt mean youre good at it

1553809 for the first film we were selling the premise of the pants
1553810 the jeans are still the glue of the film but this time around the movie enjoys the wonderful advantage of the girls own unique appeal when you have that kind of star power you gotta use it
1553811 the audience from the first film has grown with the movie
1553812 even though 12 to 16 year olds are obviously the core we are trying to appeal to older audiences with older themes
1553813 the second movie has become more about the actresses which i think is a natural progression
1553814 but these actresses are intelligent young women to be proud of i think theyre going to be role models and theyve really shouldered that beautifully

1553817 this book is full of innuendos misstatements lies he says mr corsi says its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book let me see if you stand by some of these statements doctor obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs thats a lie the truth is that he said in his own book dreams from my father that he stopped when he got into college
1553818 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped
1553819 he fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college
1553820 you said that barack obama supported a bill that allowed mothers to kill their babies even after they were born now were they gonna use knives guns or how were they gonna do that and do you actually believe that to be true
1553821 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion
1553822 can i give you a couple other corsi comments just so that people can understand the person writing this book
1553823 how long ago was anybody asked hillary why she couldnt stop b j bill being satisfied shes a lesbo when did you say that
1553824 ad hominem attacks on me are a fairly low way of trying to get to the substance of what im saying
1553825 doctor i have looked through a good part of your book all i can tell you is you say you have 600 sources most of those sources are people who have right wing agendas who are against barack obama
1553826 i f youre holding yourself out here to be an expert on barack obama and say the kinds of things youve said you have to understand why some of us question not only your standing not only the accuracy of your book but also your history

1553828 obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs

1553838 was a tough assignment for a new lawmaker since he was essentially sponsoring legislation that would strip away long held privileges and perks from his colleagues
1553839 essentially lifted illinois a state with a deep history of illicit pay to play politics into the modern world when it came to ethics restrictions
1553840 this sets the standard for us and communicates to a public that is increasingly cynical about springfield and the general assembly that we in fact are willing to do the right thing
1553841 o nlookers faint at his obamas speeches with alarming frequency compared to other campaigns
1553842 a t some point he took off his arms and grew wings
1553843 by some yet undiscovered measure to be chosen by teachers unions
1553844 i think there should be ways for us to work with the nea with teachers unions to figure out a way to measure success
1553845 i want to work with teachers im not going to do it too you im going to do it with you
1553846 obama explained that if he took public financing it might be hard to compete with the outside 527 groups who will mercilessly smear him
1553847 w eve already seen that hes not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so called 527 groups who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations
1553848 everyone ive spoken to whos familiar with this including lobbyists and people who are engaged in opposition research say the number of times he voted present on a proportional basis was probably a little less than average
1553849 we arent talking about a present vote on whether to name a state office building after a deceased state official but rather about votes that reflect an officeholders core values
1553850 this is a fellow who i think shorthanded an answer that in fact was the wrong answer
1553851 mirrored the statements the rest of us have been talking about
1553852 ill concede you cannot meet with foreign leaders with terrorists rather without some conditions
1553853 this is a fellow who i think shorthanded an answer that in fact was the wrong answer
1553854 because it was going to help people in his district
1553855 mr rezko never spoke with nor sought a letter from senator obama in connection with that project
1553856 wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
1553857 it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project
1553858 i dont know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago
1553859 there was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district
1553860 mr rezko never spoke with nor sought a letter from senator obama in connection with that project
1553861 all of his opponents off the ballot on a technicality
1553862 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
1553863 collected nearly 1 600 petition signatures in just ten days and submitted them ahead of the december 18 deadline
1553864 palmer realized that obama had called her hand and she acknowledged that she had not properly acquired the necessary number of signatures
1553865 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
1553866 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
1553867 liberal supporters support military strikes within the territory of an american ally without that nations permission

1553877 theres a fundamental principle in our law that courts ought not to sanction or encourage illegal activity
1553878 the scope of the labour rights does not include sex workers and brothel keepers as bearers of those rights
1553879 subject to the constitution the application of the enforceability of statutory claims renders a sex workers claim to fair dismissal under the labour relations act unenforceable
1553880 i may be a sex worker but us girls need the law to protect us as well
1553881 i didnt know what the ccma was im a bit shy of being the first person to challenge sex workers rights in court
1553882 i will gladly pay tax if that means i have the same protection by law as the next person

1553885 my clients tell me im looking fantastic they tell me im pretty they like talking to me and even if its all a lie its a good lie
1553886 i didnt choose this job i answered an ad for a call girl thinking i would have to answer telephones the brothel owner convinced me to try the job and i was so scared of having to sleep under a bridge that i ended up staying promising myself i will get out i didnt and now im 40 and i have to say that this was my chosen profession
1553887 im now financially so desperate that ive given myself until the end of the month and then i will go back into the industry

1553907 we are offering more to the contributor than ever before for freelancers the 60 40 revenue split is unheard of in the industry and that they keep their copyright rather than losing it after a one time sale is also unheard of

1553909 simply put many have made it their mission to bring me down
1553910 if these documents do create the reasonable possibility that the investigation of other crimes committed by sagathevan patrick johnson and koko was used to cause them to implicate me this will be decisive in my defence
1553911 there is a strong likelihood if not a probability that these documents will achieve this purpose and for this reason i should be afforded access to them
1553912 the question which cries out for reply is what caused these witnesses to make the dramatic turnabout six months after the investigation had commenced and to move from a position where they exonerated me to one where they fully implicate me
1553913 there is no question that because of my well publicised political past including the infamous magoos bar bombing and its various sequelae and my appointment as chief of the ekurhuleni metro police department after having been granted amnesty i am a highly controversial figure
1553914 there exists a strong sentiment in certain quarters especially among members of the saps that i should not be occupying the position of ekurhuleni metro police chief

1553931 depending on which project management philosophy you follow the answer could vary
1553932 project managers following the north american project management body of knowledge pmbok approach would say that they did their job to bring the project in on time and within budget and that it was the fault of the functional design and marketing team that the product failed
1553933 so it is important that a senior management representative be appointed to ensure that the project stays aligned with the organisations strategy
1553934 so it appears that ultimate project and product success depends on the integration of the efforts of the project team the functional managers and the sponsor to satisfy the needs of project stakeholders the project manager plays a pivotal role in integrating their efforts through building an efficient and effective team to achieve the projects objectives
1553935 they are busy with the dubai waterfront the burj and the underwater hotel this is just one city there is incredible growth happening out there and theres demand for project managers

1553941 the brides goal is to make her look the best and make you look the worst
1553942 brides want everything to match from the tablecloths to the dresses to the invitations
1553943 it really teaches you that you have to be careful when someone asks you to be in their wedding because it is so expensive you have to limit yourself to your closest friends
1553944 you put so much money into just being in their wedding
1553945 it would make all the difference if the bride said this is your gift
1553946 it was a black lace baby doll dress what she was trying to do was have a dress that wasnt too expensive and something we could wear again but it was horrendous and really tacky
1553947 we wanted her to pick a dress that looked good on all of us
1553948 pick the bridesmaid with the best taste and send her to nordstrom j c penney whatever come back to the bride with three dresses and let her make the decision dont require the bridesmaids to have matching shoes or hairstyles leave some individuality so they dont feel theyre part of barbies wedding fantasy
1553949 we were creating bridesmaids bouquets as the limo was waiting to take us to the church the bride wanted everyone to help her but she was in such a panic she couldnt think if we knew ahead of time what needed to be done we would have made a list

1554000 congratulations you are joining an elite team of women and men who appreciate that exercise is one of the healthiest things you can do
1554001 frequently asked questions 2 what is the difference between exercise and physical activity exercise is physical activity that follows a planned format using repeated movements to improve or maintain fitness exercise progress can be scored and counted physical activity is any voluntary body movement that burns calories

1554004 last meeting i had shared the sales data from the first half of the year as you recall
1554005 i have three additional points we should consider they include
1554006 i will make my own living mother by my pen
1554007 i love what you do and how you do it
1554008 i want to work with you here is my card call me
1554009 cover it up hide the truth let more kids get autism but we sure wouldnt give those shots to our kids
1554010 ive never had such leg pain before in my life and i run in marathons
1554011 cover it up hide the truth let more kids get autism but we sure wouldnt give those shots to our kids
1554012 weve made progress since last week we were compact and decisive
1554013 this was a difficult test because our opponents are further ahead in their preparations in the second half we scored a goal and created other opportunities
1554014 we are very motivated the coach has made it clear what road we must follow we want to improve and are working very well
1554015 the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1554016 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1554017 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him
1554018 mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that i am from south brazil and in my culture i never say i will win this this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1554019 maybe mourinho says i will win this and if he does not achieve that promise then it causes problems because its not the manager who is on the pitch its the players so if the team makes a mistake then you have to say it is the players who are bad
1554020 there is a good mixture of young talent and experience i dont think that there is any need to return to the market
1554021 they said burn him and support your gods if you are to act we i e all h said o fire be coolness and safety upon abraham and they intended for him a plan i e harm but we made them the greatest losers
1554022 i have not known you to have a god other than me
1554023 and we wanted to confer favour upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
1554024 and say o muhammad truth has come and falsehood has departed indeed is falsehood by nature ever bound to depart
1554025 you will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers to be the jews and those who associate others with all h
1554026 already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met in combat at badr one fighting in the cause of all h and another of disbelievers they saw them to be twice their own number by their eyesight but all h supports with his victory whom he wills indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision
1554027 make every drop count is our commitment to improving the well being of our consumers around the globe
1554028 we had some people on the ground who identified these individuals as bad guys basically
1554029 thats why we engaged and there is really no change in our posture since then
1554030 i vote for the library tracking project ideas 2 3 amp 4 would be technically appropriate but have practical obstacles to overcome which would be distracting or stop progress on them entirely the 5th idea is just too challenging to hold the attention of the group although it would be fine for a more advanced group with more time to work on it
1554031 i shall either ask you ten easy questions or one really difficult question think well before you make up your mind

1554034 i was not able to attend the weekly piano lessons as there was no one to send me because my mother was sick with cancer she just passed away this morning and i wanted her to hear me play you see this is the first time she is able to hear me play because when she was alive she was deaf and now i know she is listening to me i have to play my best for her
1554035 the statements by the government armed forces and police suggesting that i am dead are meant to lure me to call up our media friends so that the afps intelligence units can revive their electronic surveillance to pinpoint my location
1554036 we found out that the afps mig 21 had been cloning and closely monitoring the cellphones that we use
1554037 up to the middle of last year before we finally stopped relying on cellphones to get in touch with the media and other friends our counter intellig ence units and the masses noticed the suspicious presence of four vans constantly prowling the fringes of what the military believed was our office we later found out that the vans were fully equipped with cellphone tracking and scanning equipmen t
1554038 the afp and pnp mistakenly believe that by issuing statements about my supposed demise they can entice me to let down my guard and draw me out
1554039 in areas where the military believes we are currently headquartered the afp is applying hard tactics against the people we have received reports that several barrio folk have been arbitrarily taken from their homes and brought to military camps or secluded places and tortured to force them to reveal any information leading to our whereabouts
1554040 the ndf ev has been informed by the arnulfo ortiz command that the maximum penalty was meted on enemy spy elizabeth gutierrez after her arrest in brgy cancaiyas basey last october 24
1554041 moreover gutierrez had direct involvemen t in various cases of enforced disappearances torture harassme nt and economic disruption commit ted this year by the military in baseys villages in one case five civilians four females and one male accused of being npa guerrillas were stripped naked and tortured in the military detachment in brgy cogon of these five civilians three remain missing to date ina gerellana and her mother and husband also while it is being made much of by the military that gutierrez won as barangay captain in the village elections in brgy cancaiyas she had in fact been ensuring this by sowing fear among the residents with the help of the military the village folks were often summoned to the 62nd ib detachment where gutierrez would finger them as npa members and the former barangay captain there was even threatened with death because of the climate of fear wrought by gutierrez and the military the former barangay captain and other residents deserted the village for two weeks before the barangay elections
1554042 the arrest and punishment of elizabeth gutierrez serves as a warning to those who participate in the armed hostilities as enemy spies that they will never go unpunished the npa is intensifying all forms of guerrilla offensives to frustrate and defeat the oplan bantay laya ii fascist campaign and overthrow the corrupt cruel and puppet arroyo regime the masses of the people hail the victorious npa tactical offensives and the punishment of the worst human rights violators

1554044 will justice to the victims of glorietta and batasan bombings be as
1554045 the verdict will not change our assertion on what happened in balibo at the time namely that those five journalists were killed in a cross fire
1554046 brian raymond peters died at balibo in timor leste on 16 october 1975 from wounds sustained when he was shot and or stabbed deliberately and not in the heat of battle by members of the indonesian special forces
1554047 to prevent him from revealing that indonesian special forces had participated in the attack on balibo
1554048 the detailed and courageous inquest conducted by dorelle pinch shows that indonesian army officers including former special forces captain yunus yosfiah are war criminals
1554049 it is deplorable that the indonesian government immediately dismissed the findings of the australian inquest
1554050 we call on the next australian prime minister to do everything possible to ensure that those who carried out these killings and those who gave them their orders are brought to trial on australia although more than 30 years have gone by this inquest shed light on every aspect of this multiple murder it is vital that justice should now be done
1554051 the journalists were not incidental casualties in the fighting they were captured then deliberately killed despite protesting their status
1554052 this court has a very limited jurisdiction and its decision will not change our stance about what happened
1554053 lenqu te d taill e et courageuse men e par dorelle pinch d montre que des militaires indon siens notamment lancien capitaine yunus yosfiah sont des criminels de guerre il est d plorable que les autorit s de jakarta aient trait avec m pris lenqu te australienne nous demandons au prochain chef du gouvernement australien de tout mettre en uvre pour que la justice de son pays puisse juger les assassins et leurs commanditaires cette enqu te a fait la lumi re sur tous les aspects de ce quintuple crime plus de trente ans apr s les faits il est maintenant temps que la justice soit rendue
1554054 les journalistes n taient pas des victimes accidentelles prises dans les combats mais ils ont t captur s puis tu s d lib r ment bien quils aient annonc leur identit
1554055 cette cour a une port e tr s limit e et cette d cision ne changera rien

1554073 mj i really dont know how your money is invested so i have no way of knowing how your money is doing
1554074 keep in mind however that im a long term investor with a 20 plus year time horizon so i dont care if the market takes 10 years to work itself out however if i were a short term investor five years or less then id want to be more in cash if i were not comfortable with risk id also want to be more in cash these days because for the next couple of years we could be in for a tough market

1554077 this is all about 10 oclock and making sure we have protection available when updates are available
1554078 its a balance between making sure the defenders have protection available but not getting the information into the hands of the bad guys
1554079 the major problem is the person they wanted to charge is deceased so well never get answers from him
1554080 i think they should understand that weve been through a lot and we would like closure and this will help with that process i really feel theres been too much secrecy
1554081 i trust that the fbi or the government isnt rushing to a conclusion if they do feel that there may have been someone else involved i hope they follow through with that i really do

1554112 f r tibeter ist es usserst schwierig nach peking zu gehen und dort ihre meinung zu vertreten deshalb haben wir uns dazu entschlossen mithilfe dieses films den wahren gef hle der tibeter die noch in tibet leben nachzugehen
1554113 wir w ren eigentlich ziemlich gl cklich ber die olympischen spiele aber so vieles wird falsch dargestellt china hat die zusage f r die spiele unter der bedingung bekommen dass sich die situation in china und tibet verbessern w rde
1554114 aussenstehende denken vielleicht dass die tibeter gut behandelt werden und dass sie gl cklich sind in wirklichkeit aber ist es tibetern einfach nicht erlaubt von ihrer not zu erz hlen
1554115 auf jeden tibeter kommen hier zehn bis f nfzehn chinesen die chinesen sind berall in tibet

1554120 the president has called upon americans to do their part to conserve our intention is to give people simple steps they can take immediately and have direct impact on fuel savings
1554121 the new public service announcements give drivers tips on how they can save gasoline one television ad which will be broadcast later this year shows a gigantic oil gusher that is not coming from a well but bursting forth from the valve on a tire the announcer tells viewers that by slightly increasing the air pressure slightly in their tires they can save 50 000 barrels of oil each day
1554122 im very glad that obama is running on the platform that we can do this together
1554123 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1554124 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1554125 obamas figures assume one in four tires is at least eight pounds under pressure

1554130 its a clean diet that people once ate across the eastern mediterranean
1554131 people are curious because we use different ingredients and different methods
1554132 the word butter is never mentioned in the book and we dont add flour to thicken sauces we just let the ingredients boil down

1554141 i did judo when i was four or five years old
1554142 i also did as a teenager kung fu karate and then brazilian jiu jitsu since i was a kid i wanted to be a fighter
1554143 i have many brazilian jiu jitsu titles so i think i am one of the best mma grapplers since bjj has been developed to vale tudo
1554144 but that took years of hard work and bjj competitions i believe that everything in life comes with hard work
1554145 but when you fight in front of 23 000 fans like in montreal that s something special
1554146 i had a draw in december 2007 in super challenge grappling in sao paulo but they decided to give the victory to my opponent
1554147 but my last real loss was in july 2006 in the jiu jitsu world championships in rio de janeiro winning or losing is part of the sport i try to not let this affect me too much there is just my own pressure but i think i deal well with that
1554148 one of the main reasons i fight is to learn how to deal with that and learn how to control my mind in this kind of situation to fight you have to develop every day and im trying my best every day to do this when i train
1554149 the ufc treats me very very well and the fans are always great with me as far as being exciting goes this is just my style of fighting and i don t think about that normally my fights are exciting
1554150 ill be ready to fight anderson the best fighter in the world

1554153 it was during the processing of the scene that we got the fingerprints
1554154 it is a lot to take in i hope this person can help us find out what happened to my brother
1554155 it feels real good just getting in a little work like today and starting to move forward is a big plus for me
1554156 i expect to play every time bill belichick puts me in there and if bill wants to put me in there ill play
1554157 one day of practice usually isnt enough for bill you have to have pads on for more than an hour and a half but i feel good conditioning wise out there running around ive got to start stringing these practices together
1554158 this is my first year not starting at the beginning of camp thats been the biggest thing for me not being able to get started with my teammates ive got the pads on now and i feel like im part of the team
1554159 ive been trying to get some rest and get back healthy you realize how quick of an offseason it is when you play into february youre not as healthy as youve been in the past and you need a couple of extra weeks going into training camp
1554160 we go out there and try to put different groups together on the practice field and get to know each other and see what works and what doesnt work
1554161 thats what these practices and these preseason games are for hopefully i can become a part of that and work my way into my role
1554162 i think we definitely have the talent to be the best line
1554163 but its still to be determined well know that at the end of the season
1554164 i feel jarvis did a great job for us last year but obviously ill be able to come back and contribute
1554165 with ty and vince hopefully we can add it all together and well be a force
1554166 from the information we were able to gather he seemed to be like a society gadfly
1554167 he kind of went from influential people to influential people and made his way into the inner circle and then he would just leave again
1554168 from what i understand he was very well mannered very cultured and people were attracted to that
1554169 basically san marino is just a beautiful quiet elegant place where nothing much seems to happen but when it does everybody knows about it
1554170 i would be surprised if that guesthouse was a legal rental
1554171 usa judo didnt bat an eyelash at fletcher thorntons dozens of documented accusations of molesting young girls one of our a referees even covered his eyes and refused to look at the police reports these girls filed
1554172 well i can say thank you to the new york times for putting pressure on him to resign
1554173 but i hope usa judo can still find the courage to permanently suspend him
1554174 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1554175 despite months in intensive care surgery and many specialists he deteriorated over a period of years
1554176 he tried to have a dnr do not resuscitate order put on his chart but i refused to accept it when it got to where he could only walk a few steps he killed himself

1554178 for her to come back with anything less than fifth place would be a disappointment
1554179 but in 2003 she recognized i had to go away see new things and get new teachers a lot of people end up not making it when they could because they wouldnt make the right sacrifices like leaving your comfort zone its not fun leaving home at 16 but it helped in my confidence
1554180 that she would be lonesome that there wouldnt be people who would watch out for her make sure she did her homework and just generally do the things that teenagers need done for them
1554181 jim sr is actually a very fatherly type person to the younger athletes
1554182 he really watched out for her in every way from making her run to cooking for her so that she ate healthy
1554183 from santa monica california she came out in december and it was one of the worst winters we have ever had
1554184 i was up with her at 5 a m running and lifting she was freezing her butt off
1554185 we are obviously trying to get tom brady ready for the season but we are trying to get the other players ready for the regular season to a lesser degree we also are trying to evaluate them
1554186 there are a lot of things that go into consideration it is not just about what one guy wants to do or what is best for one guy it is about what is best for that position unit and team we try to take all of those things in consideration
1554187 i am not sure that everybody is 100 percent happy but that is football it is a team sport we have to do what is best for the team so that is what we try to do
1554188 its a little scary but you gotta play i just hope i know what im doing im in the right positions and i perform well
1554189 just to learn from someone like that the knowledge he has hes telling me stuff i didnt even know was possible
1554190 i feel pretty good about the veteran leadership and experience of our squad
1554191 i think thats the only way you learn in football is under fire and going against different defenses
1554192 its only going to be beneficial for everybody on offense to see a lot of different fronts see a lot of different coverages and prepare us because week in week out every single defense does something different
1554193 the coaches do the xs and os i dont know about that stuff
1554194 im a defensive lineman im just trying to tie up 300 pounders
1554195 homestar ruiner is a great series premiere and kick off for the season the next five months will be filled with lots of surprises
1554196 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1554197 our last game topped out at 8 bits weve heard this one might reach 9 or 10
1554198 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1554199 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1554200 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger
1554201 dont feel sorry for me im where im at because i made an adolescent choice thats it
1554202 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1554203 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1554204 that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister john howard stay there for so long
1554205 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader he is a slow acting dope
1554206 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1554207 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1554208 they put the interests of other clients they had ahead of hers
1554209 it was a major conflict of interest so she fired them shes claiming all money back that she paid them and damages in the millions
1554210 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1554211 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1554212 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1554213 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1554214 power plant that isnt really a power plant but more like a capacitor sucking up excess power
1554215 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1554216 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1554217 the performers are wearing diapers during rehearsals so they dont have to take bathroom breaks
1554218 they gave us the really long ones that youd use at night
1554219 ugh how hot and suffocating we just chucked them and used the toilet when we wanted to anyway
1554220 virginia has a chance to be a leader in the next generation of energy and it will create jobs in virginia
1554221 the federal government spends less than 2 billion a year on energy research that makes no sense
1554222 were spending 10 billion a month in iraq energy is an issue where we can get this right
1554223 in my mind its both and more i dont think any of us has figured out a silver bullet
1554224 it solution has to include alternative wind solar biofuels nuclear and figure out ways to burn coal cleanly
1554225 we should drill in the u s in alaska and offshore when we begin to bring oil in it will result in an immediate drop in gas prices when these speculators and foreign people who control oil see the u s take a decisive energy position oil prices will drop immediately
1554226 as for the federal government funding more energy research i would support that
1554227 we got in got a bag of popcorn and a box of candy milk duds probably with money left for a soda afterward and our parents knew where we were every saturday
1554228 id like to be in texas when they round up in the spring
1554229 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1554230 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1554231 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1554232 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1554233 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1554234 i want to finish my career here and im going to do everything possible to make that happen
1554235 i guess we have four weeks to see if marvel remains a steeler after this year
1554236 theyre in a tough situation right now with the team stuff so we dont want to push anything
1554237 i know they have a lot of stuff they have to consider with the team
1554238 mr rooney hopefully he can work something out before the season starts well see
1554239 ive had a great career here i think it resurrected my career i had a couple good years with the jets but never anything like this i just feel like im at home here
1554240 when you dont play on the goal line thats a big difference
1554241 willies very powerful hes fast hes quick hes strong with a low center of balance but out here we dont want him to get hurt were handicapped a little bit out here
1554242 thirty nine is a guy who could potentially be a guy in that area well see he had a nice run
1554243 it was spirited i think no 68 had something to do with that
1554244 its a unit thing and i think no doubt that chris presence was a difference for us today we pulled him it is what he does hes a road grader hes a violent run blocker and we ran behind him
1554245 i thought he was better he was downhill he went in standing up one time
1554246 he has the talent he has the skill that it takes to be successful
1554247 but theres a lot more to the position you dont have the luxury of sitting back sometimes and learning in his position he has to go out and play this year play at a high level
1554248 they have a very talented group of linebackers across the board inside and out
1554249 ive been very impressed by lawrence timmons he can do it all play inside outside cover im very impressed with his abilities out there
1554250 criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the global to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe
1554251 obviously we werent happy that someone we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1554252 i guess ultimately i wish i had said something i say that only with the benefit of hindsight
1554253 i wonder if i get to choose my cell mate
1554254 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
1554255 the young law professor stood apart in too many ways to count
1554256 back in the beginning in the self storage industry hardly anybody was doing anything on the internet as far as seo at least in my markets it was pretty much non existent so i had my run of the field for several years before i had any serious competition
1554257 one of the first search engines on which i saw bad data was when yahoo launched its local search
1554258 they apparently went out looking for names and addresses of storage facilities and they must have been pulling them from a lot of different sources
1554259 i would routinely search on my phone number for one of my facilities or search with my url
1554260 it was amazing how much bad data would come up id then try to contact whatever directory it was in to ask them if i could clean up my data
1554261 i would spend until one or two in the morning fixing this stuff
1554262 when i met localeze in san jose a few years ago i immediately saw that with these guys i wouldnt have to work quite as hard
1554263 they type what comes to mind and localeze drives those words into the listing to make the brand come out on the top of the page
1554264 in addition seven out of 10 of these search strings appear in the top position
1554265 its added activity for a title that came out a few months back
1554266 their audience is big enough we figured if we could address them in an articulate way they would find a way to enjoy and win great prizes
1554267 you two look awfully healthy to me how dare you abuse the handicap parking
1554268 individual identities are smothered burdened by layers of suppressed expression and therefore linked to national pride
1554269 as you might imagine i expressed our concern about the violence and urged a peaceful resolution through dialogue
1554270 i made the point i felt in a very appropriate way to the appropriate people
1554271 there is big and there is humungous on friday the worlds biggest company by market capitalization was worth just below 500 billion by monday the new holder of the crown boasted a market capitalization of more than twice that benchmarked against almost anything petrochinas value is huge it is worth more than exxon mobil and general electric combined roughly equivalent to the entire brazilian economy and worth substantially more than the combined economic output of the five founding members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries
1554272 an oligarchic version of the state led capitalism prevailing in latin america
1554273 for many chinese entrepreneurs the problem isnt just money its a mindset
1554274 but its time for chinese businesses to get beyond this small commodities way of thinking
1554275 would not have become the partys anointed successor without strong support from both mr hu and mr jiang as well
1554276 china by setting price controls on fuel is facing similar consequences today
1554277 and because market forces can never be completely eliminated price controls often lead to smuggling and corruption
1554278 face potential social unrest because of the acute hike in food and energy prices
1554279 while the subprime crisis will have its impacts possibly on some countries more than others the more immediate concern is that in virtually every east asian country inflation is climbing to uncomfortable levels
1554280 most worryingly in food prices but also in prices for commodities raw materials and products that require petroleum energy which includes almost everything
1554281 even the most superficial look at detailed figures leads to a fairly emphatic no
1554282 the evidence suggests the current spike in prices will be temporary fading away by the second half of 2008
1554283 build their own solidarity movement and make efforts to win international solidarity
1554284 if theres not enough international pressure and china offers support in the background then there will very likely be in myanmar something like tiananmen square a big massacre
1554285 letting protests develop until ringleaders can be identified then tracking them down for arrest after dark
1554286 he is a reformer but he was surrounded by enemies
1554287 im quite concerned about the effect this could have on economic policy
1554288 politicians from the old guard are coming back the policy tribes have returned interest groups pushing for more public spending see their chance
1554289 takenaka argues japan has worked through the problems of its so called lost decade bad loans easy credit runaway government spending
1554290 lunching at the four seasons with guys in expensive suits
1554291 accelerate the growth of chinese multinational corporations and chinese brand names in the world market
1554292 are equally at ease in delhi or davos as adept at english as hindi or marathi and thoroughly conversant in the language of modern management
1554293 please keep in mind that india started opening up its economy in 1993 and more aggressively since 1998 so this is a lot considering the short span of time while china opened up its economy much ahead so literally you cant compare both the economies and their infrastructures in the long run i believe india is the winning horse
1554294 in india the poorest person can question his leaders and take them court
1554295 indias firms outpace chinas in the race to go global
1554296 the high level of education and educated people greatly outweigh the lack of english speaking folks in china
1554297 mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you the chinese people and all of our customers who received the toys
1554298 overly inclusive including toys that may not have had lead in paint in excess of us standards
1554299 the apology though delayed should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese made products
1554300 like a bank robber apologizing to his accomplice rather than the person who was robbed
1554301 media blitz in the us financial capital its as if indias entire business elite infosys nandan nilekani tata groups ratan tata bhartis sunil mittal and many others has descended upon wall street for a national roadshow reporters notebook
1554302 this is a country of signals we want to present the picture of a confident nation ready to engage with the world
1554303 a simple choice like this could tear a family apart
1554304 i hope mattel goes out of business and is replaced with what america really wants quality toys made in america
1554305 and each toy must be capable of poisoning our youth
1554306 you will take responsibility for this or we wont make your stuff
1554307 chinese officials decided they would not attend because they were offended by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights it is beijings responsibility
1554308 beijing must be regretting its decision to stage the longest and most complex torch relay in the history of the olympics instead of a celebration of chinas emergence as a world power the journey of the flame has turned into a trail of shame the most intensive international protests against beijings human rights violations since the student massacres in tienanmen sic square in 1989
1554309 despite their english names the poor grammar and typical errors made by a chinese speaker is a dead giveaway if you need a model to look up to look at the master america
1554310 two robbers broke into this museum devastating looting and burning and left laughing and hand in hand with their bags full of treasures one of the robbers is called france and the other britain
1554311 after the torch was put on a bus protesters threw plastic bottles cups and pieces of bread at the vehicle and at a male wheelchair bound athlete
1554312 the single greatest risk to the security of american technologies
1554313 with both political camps playing politics instead of policy the impasse is likely to continue as long as shinzo abe clings to office
1554314 addressing the budget deficit is almost certainly off the table
1554315 the rate of infection is still high but concern among corporations is low
1554316 many corporations seem to think its ok to be infected several times a month
1554317 the great thing about this system is that from one computer it is possible to push out updates to all machines in a corporate network at once
1554318 i remember exactly where i was in my life back then
1554319 i had no idea what i was in for when this picture was taken good or bad
1554320 let me take you to dinner im not some scumbag i atleast want to feed you before i nail you
1554321 hah got ya gun we are about to head to ghettoville
1554322 egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1554323 i just had my interview and i told them ill chase em ill cut em up whatever they want
1554324 they told me id pay 100 the first week for housing and 60 a week after that but the company told me today i have to pay 100 every week
1554325 is free to take a bus home no one is forcing him
1554326 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
1554327 i found out who the squealer was and hes been taken care of
1554328 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
1554329 up until this point you did not know that employees were using federal grant money to pay themselves
1554330 right now i dont know what was the reason behind the whole thing
1554331 do you know why the human resources director was given 48 000
1554332 what do you say to the public who says that answer isnt good enough you should have known about this and why dont you know
1554333 if i was paying you to give me good information you gave me information thats what i had to work with
1554334 egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1554335 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1554336 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1554337 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1554338 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1554339 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1554340 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1554341 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1554342 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1554343 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1554344 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1554345 at no time did the government identify to the company any violations
1554346 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
1554347 i found out who the squealer was and hes been taken care of
1554348 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
1554349 la comunidad internacional puso ingentes cantidades de dinero para el tema forense en relaci n al tema de los desaparecidos
1554350 eso es un tema vox populi la manera como gobernaba su feudo era bastante aut rquica se le percib a casi como si fuese una fiscal a en s misma cuando es un rgano que est supeditado y dirigido por el titular de la investigaci n que es el fiscal
1554351 help me manage my crippling debt and horrible physical pain
1554352 wow you really would think you would take life a lil more serious now that you have went thru cancer
1554353 people are fucking amazing i tell you lotsa love girl and rest in peace to our amazing jayme
1554354 so anyway the reason im asking you is because i have a lump in my breast and im wondering if you think i should have it removed
1554355 well about as well as you would expect it would be having your breasts surgically removed
1554356 i get periodic updates from dr cohen he is always saying what an astounding patient you are
1554357 wow your hair is really coming in great how are you feeling
1554358 i have breast cancer so im not supposed to have hormones
1554359 god my cell phone always rings when im trying to numb someones cervix
1554360 you are now going to feel like you drank 10 pots of coffee
1554361 dont worry thats just topical adrenaline we sprayed all over your insides
1554362 an ceiling cat sed them o hai maek bebehs kthx
1554363 alright god im here cos im gonna film some stuff behind the scenes
1554364 im here cos i want to find out if lakeland is the real thing
1554365 um i want to answer all the critics on youtube who put clips of todd and friends up to just tear him down
1554366 im here cos i have had tremendous favor to interview roy fields
1554367 no one ever stopped mozart playing the piano or maradona kicking a football so they should just leave him alone
1554368 this cycle were definitely not going to be the one sucking the oxygen
1554369 it really boils down to the expectation im paying for this project and nothing else
1554370 the approach of politicians is give us the money well decide where to spend it the only time we can ever expect them to do the right thing is with everybody looking over their shoulders
1554371 sound transits new flyers will be mired in the infamous lake washington line stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for two miles or more
1554372 they want to call it a toll when it is really a tax
1554373 they want to impose a tax to support 520 its the camels nose under the tent
1554374 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1554375 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1554376 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1554377 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1554378 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1554379 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1554380 life goes by pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
1554381 why would you do this stupid work ive assigned you when you have fun internet things to look at
1554382 the industry landscape is currently so fragmented we wanted to make it easier for practitioners in this area to learn more about the technologies on the horizon which may prove of vital interest to their requirements

1554390 lo recuerdo muy bien hab amos llegado a un peque o caf situado fuera del centro en una calle ruidosa vi a un hombre que ya no era joven de tipo oriental con bigotes negros y ojos penetrantes al principio me sorprendi porque de ning n modo parec a en su lugar en tal sitio y tal atm sfera estaba aun saturado de mis impresiones de oriente y este hombre con cara de raj hind o de jeque rabe que hubiera visto mejor bajo un albornoz blanco o un turbante dorado produc a en ese peque o caf de tenderos y comisionistas con su sobretodo negro con cuello de terciopelo y su sombrero hongo negro la impresi n inesperada extra a y casi alarmante de un hombre mal disfrazado
1554391 gracias a este trabajo su propio trabajo usted puede entender algo de lo que he dicho
1554392 gurdjieff ha enterrado un hueso en sus trabajos somos como perros que sienten el olor del hueso pero no pueden encontrarlo si tenemos suficiente hambre seguiremos escarbando hasta que lo encontremos y cuando lo logremos ya no seremos perros sino hombres

1554396 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1554397 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1554398 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1554399 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1554400 i think its good for the community and its a nice way not to worry about the problems and it gives the kids a break
1554401 all in all it couldnt have gone better as far as weather and the citizens and the support from the police department as well
1554402 yum i love a nice tasty slice of hair pie
1554403 non it people think that it people dont do anything
1554404 i came here again to talk to troops and military leadership on the ground
1554405 one thing i know for sure is that arkansas troops including the 39th are performing great i wanted to let them know that we appreciate their service and to find out how i could help them and their families
1554406 i voted for the drill act because it provided our country with an opportunity to drill more here at home and decrease our dependence on foreign oil
1554407 unfortunately the republicans voted it down i will continue to vote for legislation that will allow for more drilling in the united states including off of the coast and in anwr the hard working families of my district cannot afford 4 a gallon gasoline or 5 a gallon diesel fuel they need relief and they need it now it is time for the partisan games in washington to end
1554408 i love latitude its in the stars but longitude its about time time and clocks and all the rest of that have always been a fascination for me
1554409 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
1554410 i dont want to believe youve abandoned the republican party but i have to ask have you given up
1554411 political correctness to scare them from standing up for our laws and our way of life

1554413 mention felicity one more time in my presence and youre truly gonna get it
1554414 you think i got into this coz the casting people saw me in cat suit drag at josie and the pussycats well i thought i was going to read the part of the cheetah
1554415 i thought i was 80 percent sure i was doubling now im 100 percent sure
1554416 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1554417 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1554418 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1554419 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1554420 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1554421 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearized if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this
1554422 theyve got a lot to do theyve got to show us a verification regime that we can trust
1554423 this is a step by step process i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons

1554607 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religion but on the gospel of jesus christ for that reason alone people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here
1554608 i am a christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of jesus i have little doubt that our whole country will soon be rallied to the unity of our creator and i hope to the pure doctrine of jesus also
1554609 it is impossible to govern the world without god and the bible of all the dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity our religion and morality are the indispensable supporters let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion reason and experience both forbid us to expect that our national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
1554610 oh eternal and everlasting god direct my thoughts words and work wash away my sins in the immaculate blood of the lamb and purge my heart by the holy spirit daily frame me more and more in the likeness of thy son jesus christ that living in thy fear and dying in thy favor i may in thy appointed time obtain the resurrection of the justified unto eternal life bless o lord the whole race of mankind and let the world be filled with the knowledge of thy son jesus christ

1554615 the congress of the united states recommends and approves the holy bible for use in all schools
1554616 the christian religion is the religion of our country from it are derived our notions on character of god on the great moral governor of the universe on its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free institutions from no source has the author drawn more conspicuously than from the sacred scriptures from all these extracts from the bible i make no apology
1554617 let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well the main end of his life and studies is to know god and jesus christ which is eternal life john 17 3 and therefore to lay jesus christ as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning and seeing the lord only giveth wisdom let everyone seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of him

1554620 if the posted copies of the ten commandments were to have any effect at all it would be to induce school children to read them and if they read them meditated upon them and perhaps venerated and observed them this is not a permissible objective
1554621 we have staked the whole future of our new nation not upon the power of government far from it we have staked the future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the ten commandments

1554716 she had you all ready for a transfer to california dinozzo
1554717 i had a talk with a few people apparently you guys had some sort of major breakdown a few years back but they did something and something else and then something else happened and for some reason they didnt bother to fix this part now they have
1554718 i would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a guy nailed to two peices of wood
1554719 if god had intended us not to masturbate he would have made our arms shorter

1554721 what does a dog do on his day off he cant just lay around thats his job
1554722 in fact it is from my very favorite scene and one that i have paraphrased recently in a comment on this scene is where joy who is in remission from cancer is with her husband jack

1554724 thats your kind of happy isnt it its not going to last jack

1554740 was wondering if id see you today you want your normal spot
1554741 people in the environmental community ought to be supporting nuclear power but its hard to get a plant built because of those same regulations and lawsuits
1554742 thanks to a lot of you in this room he bush got the five votes needed to help him cross the finish line we were with him then and we are with him today
1554743 i am fixing to retire in about six months but i will sprint to the finish we need common sense about todays energy needs and future energy needs we have spent two and a half billion in clean coal technology this year will spend six hundred and fifty million for advance coal research the largest amount in years
1554744 if president bush had the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal eight years ago he might not be talking about high gasoline prices in this west virginia
1554745 congress has restricted access to the outer continental shelf since the 1980s i asked them to lift the offshore ban in june for six weeks democrat leaders have not done anything
1554746 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1554747 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1554748 but as a former president he has a special perspective on what it takes
1554749 this is someone whose spouse was on the ticket a person he felt tremendously strong about who he felt had the ability to become president
1554750 he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president
1554751 and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1554752 there are things that i wished i urged her to do things i wished i said things i wished i hadnt said
1554753 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally

1554755 sparked an enormous economic boom that has now lasted with two brief and shallow recessions for more than 25 years
1554756 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1554757 until the end of his days he fought for not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1554758 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think about past and present in a different way
1554759 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity

1554765 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
1554766 i would say the community at large are outraged enraged very very angry comments have been posted on our website
1554767 my e mail box has been flood ed there are people calling for boycotts of tyson foods things like that
1554768 yes folks tyson has the right to do what they did as mad as that may make us its up to us to do what we think is right whether that means contacting them or boycotting them now for those of you who think that muslims have the right to practice their religion freely in a country founded on freedom of religion would you have given the nazis that right had they only called nazism a religion that is islam a total spiritual and political belief system a moderate muslim is one has not yet had to choose between america and islam rest assured they will choose islam or be killed as an apostate
1554769 as christians if we are wronged arent we told to turn the other cheek
1554770 tyson foods has been a traitor to america for many years they employ mostly illegal aliens from mexico for the cheap slave labor and then hang all of their medical and education expenses on the american tax payers myself i will not purchase any product they have anything to do with
1554771 i do not think that it right to exchange an american holiday for a muslim holiday if they want that day off let them take it
1554772 america is not a democracy america is a republic there is a big difference a democracy becomes increasingly unwieldly and inefficient a the pop grows a republic governs through elected representatives and can be expanded indefinitely our constitution is based on a republic somewhere along the way people have begun to mistakenly believe we are a democracy unfortunately our elected officials have been shredding the republic and her constitution for quite some time as far as i am concerned tyson also is partaking in the watering down of the united states of america i will never buy any tyson products again little by little they chip away boycott tyson this is america as someone stated the prayer rooms should be for anyone who wants to use them but i bet they are not god bless america
1554773 i would say about 75 of the people at my work place are christians i dont see our company building prayer rooms for us my childrens school is predominantly christian and again i do not see the public school system giving them rights to pray in public or in a private prayer room during our religious observed days such as national day of prayer hmmm seems to me that for the american christians at that tyson food plant have been made to take off another countries holiday and their own countries holiday has been stripped from them although muslim holidays are religious they are important to the muslim world and they would not allow christians to come into their country and implement their religious holidays over ramadan
1554774 is this america and its traditional holidays or is it middle east and muslim wishes if they have a problem let them take their holiday when they want it and do not interrupt americans enjoying their usual holidays i will think about this whenever i decide to purchase tyson products signed an old traditional american
1554775 how is it that an american holiday could be replaced by a muslim holiday in the united states of america this type of thing is happening world wide and it is how they slowly take over countries we better wise up fast
1554776 we arent practicing bigotry we are demanding justice big difference if theyre gonna create prayer rooms then it should be prayer roms that can be used by all employees not just employees who are members of an elitist group whose only wish is to crush our nation under the heel of islam
1554777 sure the company and union have every right to do what they did we also have every right to boycott the problem i have and i think the community has is that tysons action degrads our heritage and culture no one would expect them to replace labor day with easter or create christian prayer rooms but they do this not good tyson is not an island i say boycott
1554778 to confused this is yet another american freedom that is lost labor day is an american holiday we must not give in to people who come into this country and make their demands to change us if we continue to give in you confused will be wanting to go elsewhere to live because america will become just like what they left
1554779 i just went to the tyson food web site and left this comment on their customer service email i just want you to know that i will not be purchasing any of your products from now on the plant in tennessee that has replaced the american holiday with a religious islamic holiday has gone too far and reflects on your entire company for years i have had paid american holidays off but as a jew i take my religious holidays off at my own expense islam is quickly taking over our world it is not a religion of peace it is a religion of hate and death the koran states that if you do not become a follower of their religion they can kill you because anyone who does not believe as they do are infidels and worthy of death get a clue http www tyson com recipes customerservice aspx
1554780 why are we complaining do we not ask the muslims to take a day off for christmas perhaps they should have given them the choice of labor day or ramadan i think there could have been a compromise wheres the love
1554781 how many of us would move to saudi arabia and expect them to celebrate labor day for us none of us i suspect this is an outrage i am boycotting tyson foods and hope all disgusted americans will do likewise
1554782 this action is showing americans what is going to happen more and more this is worse in replacing labor day an american holdiay for this nonsense the u s will become like england in a shorter time than i thought we are playing right along with them and our children we reap the consequences
1554783 if 1 000 americans were working for a company on location in a country outside of the u s that was largely muslim do you suppose they would do away with one of their muslim holidays and replace it with one that is celebrated by christians doubt it
1554784 this is absolutely outrageous this is america a christion nation based on christion principals we cannot give over to someone who hates god and those who worship him we will boycott tyson
1554785 this is a private contract the only potential problem is if due to government regulations everyone e g the non muslims was forced to be part of this union aside from that unions should be free to negotiate for their members
1554786 score a victory for the muslims over the christians it is indeed a sad day when we became a nation of accomodation to those who have come here instead of standing our ground
1554787 yes america is a democracy that gives no company the right to change an american holiday for a muslim holiday whether its religious or not for all those cheering this on thinking it is such a great idea why dont you take yourselves to the countries that practice muslim beliefs and try to get an american holiday going there thats right you would be beheaded in a heartbeat for that action tyson did right to not follow through with this
1554788 tysons and the union have exercised their private institution rights now it is time for the rest of us to exercise ours it is obvious that these muslems dont respect our national traditions and dont care to assimilate we have known for years that tysons is a supporter of illegal aliens and amnesty and dont care a lick about anything but cheap labor and selling 2nd rate chicken products boycott tysons and stick to it tell your grocery store manager as well as managers at places you may go out to eat at that is where you can really hurt them otherwise get a burka a prayer rug and shut up
1554789 bigotry my butt this is my country the united states of america if we allowed all groups of people to do this we would be closed all the time every group would want to declare their groups holidays so we would be shut down for sure i am pretty sure that when you take the irish german italian japanese mexican etc holidays we could cover just about the whole calendar year every company should have floating holidays and this would allow any person to put in for the day off the last time i checked this was the united states of america and lets keep it that way
1554790 i bought pilgrim pride chicken and asked before ordering a chicken salad if the chicken was tyson server said i was the 10th one to ask that question bought non french non pelosi non california bottle of wine we the people can change america back drill now and vote out 276 dimwits who voted for higher oil prices last thursday help bush and cheney get unrestricted off shore oil drilling each well employes 168 workers and related service providers vote dimwits out and in 2 years anyone that lies on campaign promises 74 days to early voting go huck
1554791 it doesnt affect the town except for the employees that are working under the contract what a stupid thing to get all worked up over
1554792 i will not buy any tyson products again i have contacted tyson with my disgust for eliminating a us holiday for a terrorist holiday this is america we should not be adjusting our ways to comply with foreigners desires t roosevelt put it best when he said that those who come here are to adopt our ways and not the other way around if they are not willing to adapt to american ways i am sure that they could catch a plane back home quit trying to destroy our superior way of life for your inferior way of life besides contacting tyson i have also contacted the grocery chain that i shop at and requested that they discontinue all tyson products every real american should do the same boycott tyson they need us a lot more than we need them this is america not a 3d world islamic country
1554793 it looks like to me that the greater majority wanted to choose which religious holiday to observe and the company was merely seeking to pick among the existing holiday benefits which one so if the town people who are not workers insist that an american cultural holiday was a bad choice like the 4th thanksgiving etc the obvious choice would have been christmas most of the workers are muslim let the few christians take christmas off as a non paid holiday
1554794 i am confused as to why anyone from the community is enraged this was a labor agreement between to private organizations it does not effect anyone else this is democracy in action people the union voted to accept this what more could we ask for
1554795 tyson has every right to allow their workers a day off to observe religious obligations but they have no right to substitute for a recognized national holiday give them an extra day off without pay if it were up to me if they have to but not at the expense of american tradition

1554836 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1554837 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1554838 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1554839 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1554840 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1554841 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1554842 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like

1554914 thank you for being here today it has taken just over two years from the starting tender to finally coming to a conclusion the final two bids are sitting here in front of me and we have come to a unanimous decision this decision was not hard to come by due to some of the papers presented to us
1554915 though the petroil bid was twenty million dollars cheaper and two hundred miles shorter it appears underhand tactics were used jelena breathed in sharply as petrovskis sharp gaze turned to one of anger we have hard evidence in our possession that petroil infringed on turkish and international law by bullying bribing damaging possessions and finally injuring innocent people those who would not allow the pipeline through their land were bribed those who did not accept the bribe had their property damaged and their family threatened
1554916 not so andreas we have recordings of you threatening a farmer with broken legs if he declined we also have a document sent to a city official offering money in return for cooperation the final piece of evidence we have is that of an eyewitness account by one of our own board to your bribery the police have been informed and will be contacting you after this meeting
1554917 so due to the evidence provided petroil is disqualified from the bidding process and the pipeline is awarded to the strong bid from bp statoil
1554918 unlucky andreas better luck next time i believe we meet in a few months for the conference in houston

1555148 the last thing many believers need today is to go to another bible study they already know far more than they are putting into practice what they need are serving experiences in which they can exercise their spiritual muscles
1555149 just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
1555150 you do not realize now what i am doing but later you will understand
1555151 unless i wash you you have no part with me
1555152 not just my feet but my hands and my head as well
1555153 a person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet his whole body is clean and you are clean though not every one of you
1555154 you call me teacher and lord and rightly so for that is what i am
1555155 anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins
1555156 oh gosh im losing a lot more money than i thought i could my risk model is no longer relevant let me turn down my black box

1555159 i think apple needs to address this to really get the iphone into the corporate market
1555160 but the problem is apple has left off the on device encryption so if the device is lost yes we can remote wipe it but there is that moment in time between when the device is lost and when it gets reported and when it gets wiped and were just not comfortable with that
1555161 but in general apple is still concentrating on the consumer business and will eventually update the sdk to accommodate more serious enterprise adoption
1555162 apple thinks that if i have activesync and can sync with exchange im done and yes thats a small part of the problem very few users can get by without having connectivity to email but beyond that its security and access
1555163 its a big deal especially in regulated industries like banking
1555164 and it has to be enforceable the it guy needs to be able to say you cant get around an encryption policy you have to do it today that is impossible on the iphone
1555165 but id rather have it and force someone to hack me than not have it at all and give sensitive data away for free
1555166 in this day and age thats how encryption should be
1555167 we should not have to add on a piece of third party software that should be something thats native to the device
1555168 i think it shows a disconnect between whoever was designing the software for the iphone and the corporate market
1555169 were seeing more and more apple products in the enterprise but they havent yet made the commitment to make an enterprise phone or an enterprise desktop its a shame
1555170 im not the most popular guy at my company right now for saying no you cant use it

1555193 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1555194 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs

1555208 this will be the best country record released in 2008 hands down this is wild untamed music sung in a wild untamed voice and its brilliant
1555209 johnsons stark cinematic that lonesome song is among the best country has offered in 2008
1555210 the first great classic country album of 2008 if you like jennings and jones johnson is a shoe in for heavy rotation new listening
1555211 this ex marine redeems himself with the gutsiest grittiest collection released by a nashville major label in recent memory
1555212 the deep voiced johnson has that sad eyed straight talking storytelling quality that turned waylon jennings and george jones into superstars
1555213 that lonesome song is a testament to raw and real
1555214 for my money johnson is the best songwriter working in country right now
1555215 he strives to emulate in his own words the best songwriters the kristoffersons and cashs

1555218 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1555219 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1555220 we would have thought he would have at least have had the courage to come and see the court

1555222 we ourselves have spent weekends going through the sandhills at kurnell looking through the national park just in a failed attempt that we might find some news ourselves but of course to no avail

1555253 the first year of the event in 2006 we were scared people might not participate in events like the bobbin for pigs feet and the mud pit belly flop
1555254 but to our surprise we had more contestants than pigs feet and huge lineups for the belly flop contest
1555255 to celebrate our rural roots and have some good old country fun
1555256 its a celebration of living in rural areas its all about having a good time
1555257 with the popularity of jeff foxworthy the blue collar comedy tour and various redneck songs we knew this would be a great event because it is unique to canada
1555258 actually i thought it was a compliment in 22 years nobody cared where i played golf now all of a sudden everybody is worried about oh im not going to the british oh man
1555259 and they blasted me for it which is why i was laughing

1555262 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1555263 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1555264 its a frustrating process for any athlete whos ever gone through it to be at the top of the game moving around and all of a sudden going to the bathroom is one of the hardest things to do
1555265 its been a struggle its also been a great learning experience
1555266 the last three holes i knew i had a two shot lead
1555267 i didnt step on my big toe and make any bogeys i parred the last three nothing heroic
1555268 they talk about all the camaraderie that the europeans have
1555269 i dont know about all this camaraderie stuff sure it helps but the fact is our guys just need to play better
1555270 i had him over for dinner in ireland about six weeks ago
1555271 the first question i asked him was it a blind par 3 at home when you have a blind par 3 often the caddies stick the golf balls in the hole so ive been teasing him about that

1555284 im happy to be in the field with them and test my game against them
1555285 at the moment im the no 1 player in australia
1555286 bringing that over here i thought it was going to help me but it hasnt done much for my game
1555287 i was expecting to play well coming to the states
1555288 but i felt like i had to prove that i am the top player from my country this trip has been a big learning experience
1555289 it inspired me experiencing the atmosphere of what its like to play in a major
1555290 weve been on the same national team for a while now and we travel together a lot
1555291 this is the best field the best players the tournament is run impeccably
1555292 im thrilled to be here at all if i were to win the tournament it would mean the world to me
1555293 after two doubles in a row im trying to tell myself im healthy my family is here its nice out
1555294 im excited to go home and actually work on my game
1555295 im glad they are keeping true to the spirit of the game had they given it to uwe boll it would have been a nonstop frenzy of exploding grues
1555296 i can just not imagine a better diplomatic wingman than ambassador ryan crocker we were determined to achieve unity of effort
1555297 these are not light switch moments what you have is more of a rheostat many many rheostat moments where in small areas local areas districts and eventually provinces there is an ongoing transition and has been an ongoing transition for the iraqi forces to step more into the lead and the coalition forces to step back and provide enablers
1555298 it is this exercise of pushing the stone up the hill a sisyphean endeavor at times where you do make two steps up and one step back sometimes you make one step up and two steps back but over the last year or so from the large comprehensive offensive launched in june 2007 when we had all of the surge brigades on the ground since that time there has been a fairly steady degree of improvement
1555299 do you have an idea of what victory would be in iraq or the global war on terror
1555300 the provincial elections law then it can be declared that they have met them plan objectives in the political line of operation
1555301 we have objectives for 2009 and an end state as well
1555302 is a country that is at peace with itself and its neighbors a government representative of and responsive to its people a productive member of the region and the global economy
1555303 we have considerable drill downs that describe the objectives relative to the security line of operations relative to the enemy relative to the iraqi forces the different types that are here
1555304 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
1555305 were all on the same journey you can choose to do it with joy
1555306 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1555307 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1555308 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1555309 job is to think about the national security interest as a whole the generals job is just to get their job done in iraq
1555310 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
1555311 suddenly we find grace and joy coming in in your tears and anguish and struggle you suddenly discover community you suddenly discover friendship you suddenly discover affection you suddenly discover forgiveness you suddenly discover healing all these things come through vulnerability
1555312 you could always begin to feel pity that was a quality gods image carried with it when you saw the lines at the corners of the eyes the shape of the mouth how the hair grew it was impossible to hate hate was just a failure of imagination
1555313 it would be enough to scare us gods love it set fire to a bush in the desert didnt it and smashed open graves and set the dead walking in the dark oh a man like me would run a mile to get away if he felt that love around
1555314 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
1555315 a war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1555316 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
1555317 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
1555318 they are being exposed to sex and to talk about sex before theyre even old enough to even think about having sex
1555319 young people who watch a lot of sexual content on television have distorted attitudes about sexuality that it must be that everybodys whos not married is going around having sex all the time and having kinky sex in all kinds of strange situations
1555320 the rise of sexually transmitted diseases and the increase in out of wedlock pregnancies and births
1555321 im not sure i accept the premise that negative effects arent happening
1555322 it has been going down and the rate s of out of wedlock births and of teen births have been going down but until they go down to zero we have to keep trying to promote these positive values in our culture
1555323 the truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not there are groups of people out there who are devoted to scaring the heck out of americans i think it makes some people feel good because they say aha theres the enemy and if only we could do something about that everything would be better
1555324 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
1555325 this physical attribute looms large in our nations history as a source of prejudice
1555326 clustered in communities of sameness among people with similar ways of life beliefs and in the end politics
1555327 government should care for those who cant care for themselves
1555328 all right for blacks and whites to date each other
1555329 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1555330 i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i didnt attack obama personally
1555331 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1555332 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1555333 large gender differences in the propensity to choose challenging tasks appear to be driven by gender differences in risk aversion and in confidence about the ability to perform a new and potentially difficult task

1555364 the question of offshore drilling along with expanded domestic energy production has suddenly become the biggest political and economic wedge issue of this election
1555365 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1555582 i disagree that classical liberalism has any significant influence on conservative thought today
1555583 conservatism is a big tent as i see it with two dominant strains of thought 1 relgion and 2 neo conservatism which is big government in domestic policy and wilsonian in foreign policy
1555584 historically as i understand it classical liberals migrated to the right and accepted the term
1555585 conservatism again as i understand it has its origin with anti enlightenment theologians and their fellow scholars such as kant who so feared the power and ideas of the largely british enlightenment that they started a counter movement to it largely conducted by german philosophers
1555586 i have often wondered what the one most fundamental premise of conservatism is and i believe it is this the innate depravity of man ie original sin
1555587 that man thinks much too highly and therefore he thinks weakly and delusively of any contrivance of human wisdom who believes that it can make any sort of approach to perfection
1555588 americans have never lost and will never lose a war

1555595 you worry every day about walking outside and finding your front windshield shot out or your car spray painted
1555596 we are going to be passing out flyers this coming week to everybody in the midtown area
1555597 on our car last august the front windshield was broken
1555598 people like to brag about things that theyve done to their friends if somebody knows something we want to catch them
1555599 before she gives you detention again you know what your mum said if it happened again
1555600 i do remember what happened last time she was positively livid
1555601 i suppose you could complaint to neville about it you know how much he loves to have a go at her
1555602 oh as if i would give pansy zabini the satisfaction of bringing him into it but you know she hopes this will sabotage my grade in that class
1555603 no ill just have to suffer through the last five months of my sixth year with a fake smile on my face
1555604 and do whatever it takes to maintain my position in the class is all
1555605 well it will prove once and for all that you deserve the top spot
1555606 im serious rosie think about it zabini wants you to fail so she gives you one of the most complicated potions she possibly could while she gives malfoy the student she wants to succeed a simple one
1555607 i could brew that in my sleep and so could he
1555608 sure it will but so what yours will be too and when you brew a perfect polyjuice compared to his draught shell have no choice but to admit yours is more impressive wont she
1555609 and why you continue to sound so surprised never ceases to amaze me
1555610 just because your dad is harry potter you think youre so smart dont you
1555611 of course and just because your dad is ron weasley you think youre so charming dont you
1555612 would you expect any less from the daughter of a marketing genius and the cleverest witch of her generation
1555613 i think thats my cue to cut this one short
1555614 besides i promised ellie id meet up with her before dinner
1555615 youre meeting ellie before dinner my ellie oh do say hello for me wont you
1555616 and here i thought i was your best friend all these years
1555617 dont spend all night in the library alright you need to rest up for the match tomorrow and well you need to have a little more fun than spending every friday evening studying in the library
1555618 so youd rather i spent my time trolling around the common room and making eyes at all the boys like chloe finnigan
1555619 youre right forget i said anything have fun in the nice quiet library
1555620 i thought i might find you here do you realize its nearly time for dinner
1555621 impressive powers of deduction youve got there scorpius seeing as im never here after potions class on fridays
1555622 well seeing as it doesnt take much to impress you rose
1555623 still lacking a foot or so id say ive finished mine of course
1555624 oh of course you have although i wonder how you find time what with your busy social schedule im surprised your girlfriend isnt here with you attached at the hip
1555625 if youre speaking of lise you really are behind that was over before hols
1555626 i just dont have anything to say to her shes not particularly engaging is she
1555627 not to worry im sure there will be another fangirl step up before you know it
1555628 be that as it may i think im finished with fangirls for a while
1555629 yes i suppose even you can take a lack of substance for only so long
1555630 and thats the problem you never i say its high time you stop playing hard to get and go out with me
1555631 however could a girl say no to such an offer youre ever the charmer scorpius
1555632 oh come now rose is that the best youve got
1555633 i want you to give it to me now scorpius
1555634 dont you think that maybe all this contention between us
1555635 stop playing hard to get and go out with me
1555636 its been torture studying with you these past few months and not telling you how much i fancy you
1555637 hoping that i was right in thinking you fancied me too
1555638 but what does this what are we i mean are you sure about this with me you know we have to be sure
1555639 afraid that one of your gryffindor mates might discover your dark secret or worse that one of your bloody cousins might learn that you snogged a slytherin maybe youre concerned that mummy and daddy will find out you fancy a malfoy
1555640 that wasnt fair and i never should have said it
1555641 do you realize what happens if we do this what were opening ourselves up to if we start dating are you ready to admit to your family that you fancy me to tell them that youre going out with me
1555642 but are you maybe its not worth it to you
1555643 does that mean i can snog you after i beat you at quidditch
1555644 not in the middle of the pitch and you will not beat me at quidditch tomorrow
1555645 so are you telling me that you dont fancy another two hour lecture on the precise way to cast a proper contraceptive charm
1555646 i expect that ill be facing a lecture on a slightly different subject soon enough
1555647 but i can take it ive pretty much learned how to tune mum out when she really gets going
1555648 youll have to teach me so i can do that with my father

1555659 todays announcement sends a clear message that the competition bureau will take action against price fixers when it uncovers evidence that they have broken the law
1555660 price fixing deprives consumers of the benefits of competition such as a lower price
1555661 the harper conservatives say they favour human rights protection the conservatives dont like our charter of rights and freedoms and now the conservatives plan to gut the federal human rights act if they get their way canada will be one of the few countries in the world without protections against hatred being spread on the internet by terrorists and extremists and if the right wing conservatives get their way it will be open season on minority communities and on peoples rights races and religions transition to mosaic of faces of urban children in class brighter score the liberal party of canada has a better plan we want to protect and enhance canadians human rights and we will fight the harper conservatives scheme to chip away at the principles behind the charter of rights vote for a tolerant diverse canada where human rights still matter where you matter this message has been brought to you by the liberal party of canada or the new democrats if the liberals still have keith martin around ed

1555663 more and more we hear people express their concern in public about the fact that senate seats are not being filled
1555664 i dont accept the notion that people are going to vote first and foremost with identity politics
1555665 theres a lot of people for whom identity politics will be a secondary factor

1555667 is going to yank the other candidates chains as often as he can he cant help it
1555668 bill i think has went along to get along more than i was hoping he would do because i considered him when i first came in to the council as a progressive like me
1555669 but ive been very disappointed in a lot of decisions hes made
1555670 im really really focused on trying to not make this a campaign of people making allegations and then responding to other peoples allegations
1555671 obviously hillarys senate bid might have led to a whole expansion of the consultant side of me
1555672 as i went into adulthood i just felt like issue activism was more productive and didnt come with the kind of traps inherent in the electoral path
1555673 i got ruth messinger on board i got everybody on board
1555674 and frankly once i got the civics involvement there was very little opposition and we ended up getting 6 000 units plus commercial space
1555675 the only thing thats constant is change and this is just at the beginning so there will be a lot of change going on
1555676 theyre asking for unbelievably 2 300 more parking spaces in an area that is just so overwhelmed with traffic
1555677 and what theyre asking is for an even higher density and obviously its going to have to be scaled back
1555678 whatever name he announces the goal is for that name to be met with ooooh i didnt think he could get that person oh interesting as opposed to you know weird choice or something
1555679 thats what they need in order to stop once and for all this holt is the fat kid in dodgeball and everyone is calling it names and throwing stuff at it thing
1555680 people love writing the story of independent bookstores being foolhardy and failing
1555681 people love that story and thats almost the only thing i get called about a bookstore closes somewhere in manhattan or in new jersey and someone calls and wants a quote about you know how grim it is to be an independent bookstore and i just say i wont talk to you im sick of this story its not even a valid story
1555682 the idea was always to do a store that was a reliable destination bookstore in exactly the same way that barnes amp noble is with a lot less stock
1555683 the idea is that in a lot of sections theres a lot of dross so you can you know take the sections you have and hone them until theyre perfect so take the business section and instead of having it sprawling over an entire wall a total mess and you dont know whats good and whats bad actually focus on the books that people want and have wanted for years and focus on the books that are new that are actually good to have in all of the practical sections a careful deliberate inventory
1555684 it has an image of a rough and tumble industry where you have to be street smart to make deals
1555685 it feels still more like a business that you cant just master going back to business school inherently maybe thats intimidating to women
1555686 you sit in a meeting with all these guys and everybody is just like screaming yelling cursing
1555687 you must never cry if you cry in front of them you lose all credibility
1555688 certainly into the 1980s and 1990s there was a lot more screaming and posturing men didnt think twice about making a woman cry

1555715 even if its worn as an undergarment people can totally see that you have one on
1555716 part of being sexy is being edgy and being the bad boy so even if youre not a bad boy wearing a wifebeater gives you that implication
1555717 for the more fashion forward crowd its about the layering effect
1555718 then theres the group that wears the classic hanes beater underneath a polo shirt or a button up both are coming back simultaneously
1555719 that was like 50 years ago and were just not you know him

1555721 its probably one of the most unforgiving pieces in mens clothing
1555722 you almost have to have the perfect body to pull it off
1555723 it kind of accents the chest a little its more of a mans undergarment equivalent to the womans bra

1555743 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1555744 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1555745 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearized if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this
1555746 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1555749 we are working on expanding the mandate of the pastoral provision of catholic parishes using anglican inspired services to include those clergy and faithful of continuing anglican communities
1555750 we are striving to increase awareness of our apostolate to anglican christians who desire to be reconciled with the holy see we have experienced the wonder of several episcopal bishops entering into full communion with the catholic church and we continue to receive requests from priests and laity about the pastoral provision

1555755 and what theyre asking is for an even higher density and obviously its going to have to be scaled back
1555756 well it had to be them theyre the only ones weve seen on camera in speaking roles who arent dead yet
1555757 but why else did you think his big ole stomach hurt
1555758 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1555759 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1555760 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1555761 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1555762 even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1555763 the question is not so much about the technology but what one does with it we have quite definite laws about where cctv can be used but of course with uavs you have much greater ability to gather material in private spaces and this would lead to concern
1555764 if they are used to simply hover to gain random information then that would obviously be a matter of worry and a civil liberty issue
1555765 closely involved with the development of procedures and regulations which allow uavs to operate in national and nato airspace but the committee indicates that the ministry should do more
1555766 in the response to our report we expect the mod to set out why it supports the astraea programme only in an observer role and its future plans with regard to this programme
1555767 satellite images can be affected by clouds and lack of light with uavs you can avoid that by choosing the height at which you fly there is now also google earth but these are often old images out of date there is tremendous potential in material gathered by uavs
1555768 there will obviously be implications for privacy human rights etc that is something the government will have to address and i imagine that there will be protests from some quarters but you certainly cannot blame police and intelligence services for wanting to use them

1555841 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1555842 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1555843 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1555844 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1555845 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1555846 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1555847 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1555848 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1555849 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1555850 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important in years
1555851 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1555852 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters

1555897 the vyatta 2501 combines features performance flexibility and value on high performance hardware making it a clear alternative in a market saturated with expensive proprietary solutions
1555898 we are a nation of consumers and theres nothing wrong with that

1555900 i think the line is when you ask for items that are of a better quality than what older guests might have like your parents aunts and uncles if they dont have calvin klein sheets or vera wang dishes you may be reaching a bit
1555901 our wedding day is a chance for us to celebrate our love with friends and family and thus gifts are not expected your presence is a gift in itself
1555902 congratulations we care about you we want to do something nice for you on this momentous occasion
1555903 adevarul este ca nu multi barbati isi doresc o femeie foarte inteligenta pentru ca pana la urma este foarte greu de manipulat si controlat pana la urma oricarui barbat ii este frica de cerintele unei femei si asta pentru ca uneori acestea pot fi extrem de pretentioase
1555904 daca vrei o femeie care se fie de casa mama si menajera te vinzi ieftin asa ca iesi in lume si cauta o femeie care sa aiba ce invatza de la tine dar de l acare sa ai si tu de invatzat
1555905 initially the thought from residents was we dont need night games clogging up our streets on friday and saturday but given the build up of the bar and restaurant district friday and saturday nights are already pretty crazy the crowd arrives at noon and leaves in the wee hours if its a night game the crowd would show up a little later
1555906 i see the role as a voice to speak for those who cant speak for themselves
1555907 these women say to me we have got the courage to do what youve done because of you
1555908 thats huge to be able to admit that theres no shame in that
1555909 eventually i would like to see this role extended across the country so there are many of us helping other sexual abuse survivors
1555910 the only thing more common than sexual abuse is the cold
1555911 my first experiences with the legal side of things were quite horrible
1555912 i feel more positive now than i have in 20 years and thats because of the taskforce on sexual violence and that is a result of the bravery of louise nicholas
1555913 we started campaigning for the taskforce on the back of the marches throughout the country in outrage over the acquittals
1555914 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1555915 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1555916 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1555917 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1555918 some job factors like stress may be worse in the public sector but others like the work not being physically demanding and not being viewed by the worker as boring are better than for private sector workers
1555919 we need to pay high rates to attract decent candidates
1555920 the study was based on 2005 data so given the faster rate of public sector pay rises recently the premium was likely to be even higher now
1555921 you should come to the private sector and actually earn your living in the real world with real deadlines and real budgets
1555922 the people who are being paid large amounts are simply policy analysts it and back office beaurecrats

1555936 is an invitation to be much more a part of something really really small that is quietly changing our world but it is also an invitation to revisit our images and understandings of the story to which we have given our lives
1555937 many older evangelical christians assume that all the important questions were answered decades ago and that we got all the answers right now all we need to do is simply improve our tactics and strategies but as i look at the contemporary expressions of christian life church and mission i am not convinced that we have gotten all the answers right i am going to echo some of the tough questions i hear being raised by younger leaders on the conspiratorial edge i am going to invite us to the challenging task of revisiting five important questions
1555938 alas must it ever be so do we stand in our own light wherever we go and fight our own shadows forever

1555944 i believe education is really the key to knowledge to know one another
1555945 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1555946 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1555947 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1555948 i do believe that his goals and his priorities and the visibility that hes given the issue has been good for america and the world
1555949 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1555950 if the late house speaker tip oneill and president ronald reagan could then certainly john mccain and nancy pelosi can i think shes been very effective
1555951 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together

1556101 many students especially non majors used to think computer science was boring and now they love it we found that bringing personal robots into the classroom creates a dynamic context for learning the foundations of computer science and makes computing a more social and creative activity
1556102 during a time of declining student interest in science and technology our goal is to get as many schools as possible to adopt the curriculum and help reverse that trend
1556103 robots are a compelling way to stimulate students and spark their imaginations to consider the endless possibilities of careers in computer science
1556104 with these awards our continued partnership with georgia tech and bryn mawr college and new technologies such as the microsoft robotics developer studio we hope to accelerate the broad development of robotics programs making computer science more immediate relevant and significant for students and professors everywhere
1556105 we have found that students are really enjoying and learning using the personal robot in the classroom its interactive engaging and fun our numbers of majors and students in computer science is at a record high this is especially encouraging since women have traditionally been underrepresented in the field we hope that these awards can help other institutions make a difference in exploring robots in education

1556131 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
1556132 working with our colleagues at the universite de montreal we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
1556133 we believe that this improvement may represent a significant step forward and is worthy of future clinical development
1556134 the fact that we can stimulate a specific long term immune response gives us great hope that with additional development we will be able to give people infected with hiv a new option to battle the virus

1556144 i always get fat when i try to build mass
1556145 obviously to put on lean body mass you have to stimulate the body to do so through high intensity weight training
1556146 you tend to stay fuller longer and may have less of a tendency to eat
1556147 sure the body needs protein to grow but much of that protein is often wasted if total caloric intake falls too low
1556148 more work less calories match your daily caloric intake to your expenditure and include some aerobic work along with your weight training to get your body to use fat as fuel
1556149 increasingly customers are looking to focus on their core competencies and to bring in experts where needed

1556167 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1556168 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1556169 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1556170 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1556171 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1556172 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1556173 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1556174 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1556175 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1556176 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity
1556177 how this perchlorate in the soil affects habitability is a complex question that we certainly dont have the final answer on

1556181 as a musician and an active member of the music scene i noticed a need for a drink that was both natural and calming but could also help maintain mental clarity my passion for the music business together with my knowledge of the beverage industry was what really led me to the creation of drank
1556182 although i originally had the music industry in mind when i developed drank i realized there was a real need across the board for a product that could relax and refresh naturally
1556183 knowing there are many options in the application monitoring space we are pleased that the infoworld bossie awards has recognized hyperic hqs as a stand out among these choices

1556195 we simply force feed anyone we dislike terror suspects plate after plate of bushs beans then lock them into the aroma chamber i havent had this much fun since burning ants with a magnifying glass
1556196 there are those who maintain that those who work within the washington dc beltway have a sheltered view of the world this design proves once and for all that we have the proper perspective
1556197 we are here and it is now further than that all human knowledge is moonshine
1556198 its a major deterrent for crime because if the criminals know that everybodys watching out for each others property theyre going to go somewhere else
1556199 in my neighborhood i tell my neighbors when im going on vacation and i dont worry about my property
1556200 by people just knowing each other then if you see anything suspicious or a car or someone call 911 say that someone i dont know is in my neighborhood
1556201 theyve failed to register in accordance with the guidelines what were out doing today is picking those people up arresting them on those charges
1556202 many times well hit 9 10 11 addresses before we find the real address
1556203 these people are on the run they know theyre wanted
1556204 we did have an individual who had a pre warning that we were coming and he was trying to get rid of a firearm it couldve been a dangerous situation he was walking across the yard with the firearm in his hand to try to hide it because he was a convicted felon and was not supposed to be in possession of it
1556205 during the course of something like this well encounter additional criminal violations that well see we had a weapons charge and a drug charge today in addition to the warrant
1556206 it lives a lot bigger than what it is its got a lot of amenities that you wouldnt expect in a town of 25 000 people
1556207 the cost of living is cheap we have a lot of people moving in from colorado and up north in fact my wife i brought her in from chicago
1556208 we love russellville and coming from northwest arkansas we had to get use to not allowing 30 minutes to get somewhere
1556209 its just a laid back community when one hurts we all hurt
1556210 someone called wanting to know where he could learn how to drive
1556211 when we have to go on a non emergency call for instance when we have to go check up on a child thats dialed 911 that takes an officer away from a real emergency
1556212 it shouldnt go on people shouldnt call 911 not unless it is an emergency
1556213 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest

1556217 but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom
1556218 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1556219 the sound actually was just these people revving their foreign oil powered bikes for no reason at all beyond a childlike delight in destroying everybody elses peace and quiet
1556220 i laughed when i heard the guys at buffalo chip tell the story but then i thought about the conversation i had with pearl gulbranson who was working at the crisis intervention center for domestic abuse which is located in a house across the street from the broken spoke

1556231 morph appspace is a complete package with all of the features that we need it works so well its become our standard deployment platform for everything we develop
1556232 morph appspace makes it absolutely effortless for a company like ours to develop and deploy web 2 0 applications using ruby on rails
1556233 we have deployed our own software as a service in the past but found it was not an effective use of time using morph has dramatically simplified the application deployment and management process its not only a safe and straightforward hosting environment it also provides a real time monitor of activity that allows us to assess use

1556239 hes very humble and he was just as worried about his own rear end as his buddy that was hurt as well
1556240 bob has a crack in the left side of his hip
1556241 the impact that they had the way the doctor described it was that it was like pulling every muscle in his body in one shot
1556242 then he couldnt get a signal again and what he proceeded to do was start texting once he had a contact from search and rescue
1556243 the plane crashed at 7 15 a m and they didnt finally triangulate him until 4 30
1556244 he had very little battery power left and when we were looking at his phone and reading the text messages that went back and forth right smack in the middle was two marketing texts that came in from telus
1556245 i believe this is the first time someone has resorted to texting
1556246 it is good and good to remind people that when a signal is too weak for voice communication you may still be able to communicate by text
1556247 we are here and it is now further than that all human knowledge is moonshine

1556251 to offer a correction or an explanation for his column from last week in which he apparently reported an obama quote without a full context turned the meaning of the quote inside out
1556252 a week ago tonight milbank appeared on countdown and was identified as
1556253 the cnn contract was negotiated long before the obama column
1556254 its just that cnns a better fit for me and my philosophy of holding all parties to account
1556255 i have a lot of friends in ownership in the nfl and my desire to get involved has not been a secret
1556256 i have no debt whatsoever this would require changing that
1556257 there is a whole lot of interest in the rams with the nfl being a business entity that a lot of people want to be involved in but its becoming a billionaires club
1556258 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1556259 so i told them something simple i said you know what you can inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level
1556260 we are here and it is now further than that all human knowledge is moonshine
1556261 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things
1556262 people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong
1556263 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
1556264 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
1556265 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
1556266 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
1556267 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1556268 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1556269 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1556270 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1556271 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1556272 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1556273 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1556274 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1556275 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1556276 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
1556277 probably comes down as a positive rather than a negative
1556278 my hard work is beginning to pay off and so far has allowed me to purchase my first home a beachfront house in belize

1556280 i went through years of financial and emotional struggle to get here
1556281 this study is encouraging because the fmri technique allowed us to see and compare the activity levels in specific regions of the brain before and during vision restoration therapy after examining the images the increased activity levels demonstrate progress associated with the treatment
1556282 based on these initial results we will continue to investigate the relationship between the imaging findings and the degree to which vision is recovered
1556283 students opting for online education need to research the programs thoroughly
1556284 costs of online degrees vary and students need to make sure that the degree they are working towards is valid and from an accredited institution
1556285 coligne engineers ostapeks composite long carbon fibers into a patented high density sagittal plane configuration this enables us to build vbr cages that simulate the bone trabecula architecture of a vertebral body
1556286 the engineering required to meet the extreme demands of veterbral body replament surgery will have many applications in the future
1556287 with todays multidisciplinary oncological treatments and the surgical interventions that can now be performed these patients are living longer some are completely cured and return to active life
1556288 our experience with many metal vbr systems made us understand that the best long term stabilization we can provide patients would be to help them build a suitable bridge of growing bone to replace the vertebra that has been removed and achieve a definitive anterior arthrodesis the ostapek composite vbr design increases the volume of bone graft possible in a modular and stable construct and we are convinced this improves the patients possibilities to create a viable stable and definitive fusion
1556289 we have used the device to treat several patients the most recent involved implantation of an ostapek vbr after the en bloc removal of 4 vertebra the first time in our department
1556290 our early experimental and clinical results are encouraging the ostapek vbr has been the subject of two department publications we are working on another
1556291 it is rare in a surgeons career to be able to work with a new biomaterial
1556292 we have used cobalt chrome stainless steel titanium and various plastics but only recently have we been able to work with long fiber composites that are changing performance in other domains outside spine surgery i have now used ostapek lumbar plates with titanium screws in 50 patients the plate has strength for correction and flexiblity that approaches bone it is also radiolucent allowing us to observe early bone formation through the foramen with normal x ray i am looking forward to using the ostapek vbr

1556296 minimal progress has been made in adopting a more customer oriented crm based approach within the contact centre environment over the last 10 years when we compared this years findings with those from our inaugural 1997 report the picture is not positive
1556297 these findings indicate that the development of a more holistic and sophisticated approach to customer management is less of a priority than it was 10 years ago and there is a back to basics trend with contact centres focusing more on basic performance efficiencies and cost reduction
1556298 this is also reflected in the commercial drivers of contact centres only 16 of participating centres ranked creating direct customer relationships among their top three commercial drivers compared with over 50 10 years ago this underscores that there has been a major shift away from the tenets of crm over the last decade
1556299 this years survey confirms that when the basic service components are firmly in place customer service experience improves and client retention accelerates when we compared these service components to the level of priority or attention organisations place on them the results were enlightening
1556300 the choice of medium or channel was ranked among the lowest methods for customer service improvement less than 2 of participants selected this option in their top three choices for impact on customer satisfaction
1556301 taking into account that call resolution is the greatest indicator of customer service improvement we were surprised to learn that not all contact centres have aligned themselves to its measurement and targeting
1556302 contact centres still rely on the standard efficiency metrics abandon rate is the most commonly used target with 90 1 of participating centres using it as a key metric while only 63 4 of centres use first call resolution as a performance target these findings indicate a discrepancy between what customers want and what contact centres focus their costs and energy on
1556303 compared to last years benchmarking report these figures highlight the ongoing trend by organisations to reduce investment in training even though agent communication and service skills enhance customer satisfaction and the service experience
1556304 the select certification and smb specializations are designed for partners focusing on ciscos smb product portfolio including ciscos smb voice security and wireless platforms

1556309 im not really here to sit on the bench im just going to do it little by little
1556310 weve had a few incidents with freshmen guys who have swagger but dont be too confident
1556311 i have some obstacles but im going to hopefully surpass them and be on the field against tennessee
1556312 i was a little nervous but once i got my first few carries i made some cuts and then i realized theres no pain no anything
1556313 ive never been on the field when hes been full speed
1556314 im coping with it pretty well and i think im going to be competing for a spot so i just want to go out there and give it my all
1556315 if you use this i think that people could decide well ive been going to woolworths it looks cheaper at coles why dont i go there he said
1556316 that sort of opens their eyes to the fact that there are alternatives
1556317 a bit cowardly we would have thought he would have at least had the courage to come and see the court and what was going on
1556318 featuring of three oakwood apartments in our list is a great achievement for us online users who wish to make their stay in westminster london can make their reservation in these apartments with more addition of apartments to apartotels com we aim to explore new facets of online travel industry

1556326 this product could have an enormous impact all over the world
1556327 the diatroxal study met the criteria for the gold standard trial which is the most rigorous standard to meet furthermore diatroxal produced astounding results
1556328 it is exciting to bring global digital media solutions and exposure to local niche businesses like international trajectories that traditionally would otherwise not have used a web site to reach their target audience
1556329 at ais media we develop and manage world class web sites and deploy internet marketing strategies that deliver measurable results for our clients
1556330 it was such a pleasure working with ais media from start to finish
1556331 having come into the project with little experience in web site development ais media was very helpful every step of the way i couldnt be more pleased with the site
1556332 from its inception marzar has always been intended to be a social networking site for businesses marzar has been working hard to build a quality network with a membership that is active marzar disables accounts that are not active or where the profile is not properly filled out unlike our competitors we have always sought member feedback
1556333 we are very excited to have andrew join the team his background building software solutions for companies of all sizes makes him uniquely qualified to assist with taking marzar to the next level
1556334 from the time i became a member of marzar i could see that it was a very different site over several months i joined groups interacted with other members and made suggestions for fixes improvements i had such a positive experience that in december 2007 i approached john to see if i could contribute to his vision johns vision for marzar as a business productivity platform was is so clear that i knew i wanted to participate
1556335 following a visit to ottawa a number of design sessions and a lot of negotiation john agreed to allow me to participate once we finalized the agreement john disclosed his plan for monetizing marzar this is truly a very exciting opportunity
1556336 we believe that we are working towards building the next generation of networking platforms and already have huge interest in our plans from publicly trading companies says john horsley founder ceo marzar com inc
1556337 find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time
1556338 call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
1556339 how do you deal with this kind of an injustice i wouldnt protest i dont believe in protesting i think it demonstrates the failure of representative government my answer to that problem is i want to empower you as a lawmaker dont rely on your elected officials
1556340 the question is whether he crossed the line in saying find out where his kids go to school
1556341 that to my mind and to government officials including those in the fbi crosses the line into
1556342 overwhelming showed and incontrovertibly demonstrated that he was head of the islamic jihad network in the united states
1556343 like another person on the jury i was convinced mr al arian was still working with the palestinian islamic jihad after it was illegal he was a very smart man and knew how not to be obvious
1556344 i think most queenslanders would be rightly concerned about the integrity of a queensland health investigation into potential wrongdoing on the part of queensland health staff
1556345 it seems like a classic case of caesar judging caesar
1556346 given queensland healths poor record in managing these issues to date we have concerns about the governance structures and the management accountability within queensland health
1556347 we believe its essential that an external body continues to monitor that very closely

1556352 it does add to the case that the next move will be a cut in rates
1556353 timing is the big question on everyones lips at the moment
1556354 in this credit environment there is a question mark of how quickly it turns around
1556355 for inpatients negative screens need to be repeated at intervals of three days to achieve three negative screens to be conclusively cleared
1556356 the fact that vre is there at all is a cause for concern
1556357 if it gets into the bloodstream of someone who is already ill or someone like a transplant patient then it can causes problem
1556358 not everybody who has it gets sick there would be people who had it who would not know they had it and would not be particularly affected by it
1556359 people with joint replacements and gall bladder removals are having to be put off
1556360 weve got very long waiting times so that represents quite a blow to those people thats perhaps the greatest impact
1556361 isaia is currently at fullback for auckland and has played there previously at the international and the rebel sport super 14 level
1556362 hes also got the ability to play elsewhere in the backline which is helpful when we are a long way from home
1556363 leon is improving but the medical advice is to take things slowly
1556364 hell gradually get back into exercise and then training and then may look to play an air new zealand cup match
1556365 its been ten years of triumph on and off the field as the capital has embraced the new zealand leg and made it its own
1556366 the fans come ready to enjoy themselves and this year the tournament generated 15 6 million of new spend into wellington citys economy
1556367 we are committed to making the nzi sevens a special experience and well be ramping up the excitement for our tenth birthday

1556377 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1556378 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1556379 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1556380 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1556381 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1556382 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearized if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this
1556383 our legal counsel is currently reviewing the possible next steps in the litigation and while we are disappointed by the courts decision it has no impact on our day to day operation of the business
1556384 we have not factored any income from canon into our business plans we continue to make excellent progress in the other areas of our business including conductive inks sensors and nanomaterials as well as in other activities in the electron emission and display fields such as backlights our revenue and backlog levels remain strong
1556385 the application for stay of execution of sentence of death is denied
1556386 i told the president im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about uranium enrichment activities as well as nuclear testing and proliferation and ballistic missile programmes
1556387 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1556388 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas im very happy to see the torch relay
1556389 weve had 30 years of reform and opening up i hope foreigners will understand china
1556390 i feel excited and proud because its the first time china will hold the olympics and china has been looking forward to it for a long time
1556391 amid the aspirations and well wishes of the people of the entire city it will complete its harmonious journey welcoming the grand opening of the games
1556392 i will only run a few metres but the experience will remain with me throughout my life
1556393 i want to be a personal assistant to the nelsons
1556394 if they had a meaningful vote i have no idea who would win
1556395 but i know that if sen obama were sure he would win there wouldnt be a negotiation
1556396 what they have to do is make it possible for people to say to themselves that there was a fair and correct process
1556397 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1556398 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1556399 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1556400 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1556401 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1556402 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1556403 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1556404 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1556405 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1556406 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1556407 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1556408 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1556409 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1556410 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be
1556411 all of us have questions about relationships sexual thoughts or behaviors my life experiences and professional credentials will help you sort through it all
1556412 an old indian lady was carrying some potted plant for the temple prayers gently asked a strong healthy young man to let her have the seat but he just shook his head slightly and ignore her oh how rude
1556413 ivanhoe australia now has the dedicated financial resources it requires to move on with the discovery and development assessment processes and to expand its deep drilling exploration program to probe beyond the limits of previously discovered resources
1556414 there has been much publicity regarding the uncertain macro economic settings including higher interest rates higher fuel costs and the uncertainty surrounding capital markets
1556415 many of our business units operate in markets that still exhibit growth despite these factors
1556416 we expect some improvements in businesses that have underperformed this year and the diversity of our businesses further mitigates the risks associated with these economic settings
1556417 hills is not heavily exposed to the domestic housing cycle and as such we expect a satisfactory result in the year ahead
1556418 social networking is in its infancy and im guessing it will become as widespread as email
1556419 social networking is going mobile and asia plays into that because often the first experience of the internet there is through mobiles
1556420 there is also an increasing sophistication in marketing it is the ultimate viral marketing and when done well consumers will spread the advertising for you
1556421 the opportunity to be global ceo of a company doesnt come up every day
1556422 nevertheless we would expect profit growth for 2008 09 to exceed 12 per cent
1556423 the strong growth in profits reflects both the buoyancy of the western australian economy and the major internal improvements made by the company in the past year
1556424 we still believe they would be best served by allowing two media experienced directors representing seven on the board
1556425 clearly there is not enough positive news to get the market excited about the stock
1556426 its the strongest showing weve had since god knows how long
1556427 the market got excited because the us federal reserve said it would hold rates where they are which is a good thing
1556428 and now of course the reserve bank here has alluded to a cut at some stage in the future
1556429 clients have been battered and are still shaking their heads a little bit dazed and hoping there are better days around the corner
1556430 if we had some sunny days ahead of us then i think they will start to pay attention again
1556431 things have to get worse for the aussie to continue selling off
1556432 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1556433 it would take very strong fundamental support for the australian dollar to regain recent highs and those fundamental supports are pulling back more quickly than we had anticipated
1556434 there has been much publicity regarding the uncertain macro economic settings including higher interest rates higher fuel costs and the uncertainty surrounding capital markets chairman jennifer hill ling said in a statement
1556435 many of our business units operate in markets that still exhibit growth despite these factors
1556436 we expect some improvements in businesses that have underperformed this year and the diversity of our businesses further mitigates the risks associated with these economic settings she said
1556437 hills is not heavily exposed to the domestic housing cycle and as such we expect a satisfactory result in the year ahead
1556438 if its so fucked up then do something about it
1556439 well doctor i cant understand why they keep sending me here im perfectly normal after all i maintain a full time job i have a family and a wonderful and overall stress free life i dont understand why im here just like i told you last time
1556440 well smudge as i did mention in our last session people dont get sent to these places for no reason you havent told me what the incident was that caused your family to send you here im sure it has something to do with that
1556441 smudge we are here to find that out why dont you tell me about your parents
1556442 mom was a carpenter and dad was an artist and painter they worked hard loved each other what else can i say
1556443 smudge tell me why do you think they sent you here
1556444 they think im crazy because i can see the truth behind things i dont blindly follow like the sheep they want me to be do i
1556445 i dont think like everyone else i stand out dont i i talk differently dress differently think differently i have new ideas and a unique perspective on the world and they send me here because they think thats what makes me crazy

1556449 is it everyone once looked under a microscope can be discovered to have different mental issues everyone has something about them that if they let it out theyd be considered crazy so they keep it in always afraid of what everyone else will think

1556451 youre calling me wrong because you know im right or because youve been so trained to reject any and all forms of so called insanity or meerly thinking in a new perspective that you cast me out as wrong without a second thought doctor

1556619 when i meet up with them today its usually at some of my concerts and theyre all over the place usually theyre grey haired ladies like myself
1556620 i am the security officer whom len kiely sexually harassed
1556621 on being told the free government quota of alcohol had been reached mr kiely became upset and proceeded to sexually harass me and undermine my security position in a very loud and obnoxious way
1556622 im confident that len will continue to be a good local member for the people of sanderson
1556623 i do not remember in the history of action week when we had so many consecutive days of rain
1556624 the promenade on the boardwalk is being moved into the centennial arena and the blast from the past concert has also been moved indoors
1556625 were just going to play it day by day and see what we can do

1556631 courtney cox was one of the best outside hitters and katie jo and tess rogers were outstanding players with a lot of talent
1556632 i was able to work with tess rogers my first year here at csu and she was a great player and a fantastic athlete
1556633 it is definitely an honor and i am still a little overwhelmed when i think about it

1556639 permit me to control the currency of a nation and i care not who makes its laws

1556648 those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
1556649 so for several years now we have had large studies which question the benefit of influenza vaccination the notion that flu shots are so important thus seems more the result of repeated assertion than the weight of solid scientific evidence
1556650 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine

1556659 the purpose of all branches of yoga is to raise the kundalini to raise the dormant power of the being so that he can have excellence

1556670 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1556671 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1556672 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1556673 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1556674 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1556675 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1556676 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward

1556693 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1556694 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1556695 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1556696 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1556697 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1556698 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should

1556703 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1556704 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1556705 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did
1556706 its the right time for the club its the right time for myself ive had a great run

1556712 i dont condone what hes done but i would keep him why wouldnt you
1556713 theres 15 other clubs that would chase him and why are they any better to think that they could probably straighten him out
1556714 these players are so educated that has really shocked me theyve been just told and told and told
1556715 dids has ended up having to face the music over the last couple of years and unfortunately hes in that boat at the moment
1556716 whos more to blame in this instance the guy driving or the passenger is he guilty by association
1556717 he got into the car i understand he was in the wrong place at the wrong time but in the end if there was blame to be put on here i know who id be spanking moreso than the other
1556718 theres 15 other clubs that would take him on tomorrow and the ones that wouldnt take him on its because they couldnt probably provide the proper trade to get him across the line
1556719 that sized player and type player weve got plenty of so i think if were looking for a player from another club
1556720 i think it would have to fit our needs or maybe some hole weve got in the team

1556740 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1556741 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1556742 that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister john howard stay there for so long
1556743 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader he is a slow acting dope
1556744 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1556745 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us

1556751 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1556752 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1556753 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1556754 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1556755 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1556756 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1556757 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1556758 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1556759 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1556760 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment

1556770 the feral legends series is a new label for feral
1556771 i wouldnt call it an experiment we do plan on the line being a continuing and growing area we cant say now what other titles are coming or exactly how many what i can say is that we have strong plans for its future
1556772 it was more of the former and not the latter
1556773 we felt that there were a number of titles that fit under an umbrella of classic games these would be games we want to differentiate from newer titles as theyve grown an image of popularity and fame
1556774 i cant get into the details of what makes a legend its really a balance of a number of factors

1556778 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
1556779 these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives
1556780 to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline
1556781 it was a mistake to launch mobile me at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1556782 we all had more than enough to do and mobile me could have been delayed without consequence
1556783 the mobile me launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1556784 and learn we will the vision of mobile me is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1556804 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore
1556805 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1556806 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security

1556813 this is just incredible that they would even accept this gift from venezuela
1556814 we call on gov omalley and also montgomery county executive ike leggett to repudiate casa
1556815 montgomery county can take care of its own problems thank you no thank you
1556816 as a government montgomery county did not feel the need to receive anything from the government of venezuela or make any efforts but obviously private organizations can do what they want
1556817 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore

1556823 well so much for that plan but at least the goose decoys will be safe
1556824 do you see the roof gone then why are you down here
1556825 i told you to leave that damn dog in the garage
1556826 im not leaving sarah out in the garage when gracies down here
1556827 you could have just left her in the garage what do you think you do with a farm dog
1556828 we had gracie and cocoa down here we couldnt leave sarah
1556829 oh cocoa was running around upstairs when i came home
1556830 why why gracie rolls in poop sarah poops downstairs theres cat poop on the stairs

1556835 these new markets will be a welcome addition to the sydney cbd providing a lively place for people to shop relax and enjoy fresh fruit vegetables cheese wine and a range of local produce
1556836 the markets will help re energise the newly upgraded square at cook phillip park and give sydney workers and residents access to fresh food and fine produce in line with our sustainable sydney 2030 vision
1556837 hawkesbury harvest is a community based organisation which began as a small group of farmers passionate about the hawkesbury region and its agricultural heritage
1556838 were really excited about giving farmers from across the sydney basin the opportunity to promote and sell their fresh seasonal produce in the heart of the city
1556839 i believe that our action plan combined with the broader reforms that are already in train to further strengthen competition policy such as the amendments to the misuse of market power provision and the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct will ensure that the grocery market remains competitive
1556840 the introduction of unit pricing combined with grocerychoice will empower consumers to find the best deals at the supermarket
1556841 mr rudd said hed do something about the price of groceries the report today doesnt do anything about it at all
1556842 in fact what mr rudds now proposing as some sort of what he calls grocerychoice is in fact grocerywatch and australians have woken up to fuelwatch as being nothing more then a stunt so too grocerywatch and giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the price of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1556843 i think weve got to be quite concerned about the compulsory nature of unit pricing on small independent retailers and grocers throughout the country we know that coles and woolworths and franklins are able to and some of them have already started to move in the direction of unit pricing but youve got to be very concerned about the impact on small retailers and small grocers throughout australia
1556844 a competitive food and grocery sector exists in australia and delivers competitive prices for consumers australian manufacturers already compete in a market based very heavily on consistently low prices
1556845 the industry has always maintained that packaged grocery production is a cost demanding industry and the accc has today reiterated our long held position in their report
1556846 the industry has taken note of the acccs recommendation regarding the development of a mandatory nationally consistent unit pricing system and is committed to working with the accc and government to ensure that a best practice regime is developed
1556847 unable to shine significant light on the operations of the food supply chain
1556848 although the accc analysis has started the process farmers remain bemused as to why there is such a huge gap between what farmers are paid at the farm gate and what consumers are charged at the checkout
1556849 only a comprehensive review of the complete supply chain will help farmers and consumers to understand where the consumer dollar is going
1556850 it has failed to comprehensively address issues of market power at the farm end of the supply chain given the reports six month time frame this comes as no surprise
1556851 one thing farmers were looking for and the accc has recognised is that written contracts need to apply between all purchasers of horticultural produce wholesalers exporters processors and retailers alike
1556852 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1556853 the grocery price website has the potential to increase competition in the sector by alerting consumers as to the cheapest items and where to find them
1556854 some of you may be aware that i conducted an interview with healthy amp organic living magazine august 2008 within which i mistakenly identified henbane as a herb i have previously used in salads this is incorrect please do not seek out henbane i meant to identify the herb fat hen
1556855 henbane is poisonous and you should not consume it in any way it is of course rather an embarrassing mix up but i am glad to say that there have been no reports of any casualties please do accept my sincere apologies

1556860 todav a no conocemos el informe que no nos ha sido enviado por el gobierno ruand s de manera que no estamos en condiciones de reaccionar a l
1556861 i wish to state here that this is an important decision by the cabinet that the state government must not use the cars for its state executive councillors or any officers entitled to use official cars this is what we have decided upon
1556862 since the cars have been bought and to sell them would only result in a loss all of them must be used for state guests or dignitaries
1556863 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1556864 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1556865 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1556866 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1556867 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1556868 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1556869 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1556870 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1556871 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger

1556873 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1556874 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1556875 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1556876 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1556877 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1556878 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1556879 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1556880 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1556881 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1556882 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1556883 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1556884 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1556885 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1556886 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1556887 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1556888 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1556889 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1556890 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1556891 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1556892 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1556910 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1556911 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1556912 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1556913 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1556914 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1556915 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1556916 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1556917 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1556918 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1556919 a person includes any human from the time of fertilization
1556920 we are honored to have received these endorsements from such respected physicians
1556921 science clearly proves that life begins at the time of fertilization we are secure in the fact that we have science and reason on our side and we are pleased to have the medical community supporting our efforts
1556922 as support for amendment 48 accumulates we are very encouraged as we get closer to novembers election
1556923 every human life should be protected and the endorsements we continue to receive prove that our easy to understand amendment is one that all coloradans can support

1556932 weve fared this pretty well thank god weve had a lot worse
1556933 we encourage all supporters to check out the official endorsement list online and ask their local and county elected officials to download the form and endorse amendment 2 if their names do not appear on the list
1556934 we are grateful to have the support of many of floridas top officials who understand the importance of natural marriage to children families and society however we will win this campaign not through a head count of elected officials we will win this campaign because the people of florida understand why marriage is critical for the next generation and do not want a new morality forced upon them by an unelected unaccountable branch of government
1556935 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1556936 i oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
1556937 i support the efforts of the people of california to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman just as we did in my home state of arizona i do not believe judges should be making these decisions
1556938 we are honored to have the support of senator mccain as a leader in the united states senate and the presumptive republican presidential nominee senator mccains position will be an important factor to millions of californians
1556939 senator mccain has articulated a key feature of the initiative campaign which is that voters and not judges should be determining this issue
1556940 over 61 of the electorate has already voted to reaffirm marriage as between a man and a woman four activist judges on the california supreme court in san francisco wrongly substituted their own narrow views for the opinion of over 4 million california voters fortunately voters will be able to correct that mistake in november and restore the definition of marriage to our constitution
1556941 we look forward to working with senator mccain and many other elected leaders to accomplish this we hope that u s senator barack obama will join senator mccain in endorsing the initiative and would welcome his support as well

1556947 if the game is the champions league final or the opening tie of the olympic tournament then i am interested in it and want to see the best players giving their all the big boys of european football want the best footballers in the world but to be thought of as one of the best players you must play international football against the rest of the worlds elite the sport is no longer a sport it is a business each player an investment for the stars at this event it is not about making money it is purely about sporting honour something the greedy parasites who control so much of our game have no interest in

1557033 this new data is a wake up call about the devastating effect of our unbalanced china trade on american jobs wages and our economy
1557034 the damage is being felt in every state and as the trade deficit continues to grow and china moves into higher wage sectors the trend lines on the future loss of jobs and depression of incomes are especially alarming
1557035 the major causes of the skyrocketing trade deficit with china are no mystery
1557036 chinas manipulation of its currency makes the yuan artificially cheap effectively subsidizing exports beijings suppression of labor rights lowers wages china subsidizes some key industries and maintains barriers to some imports we must demand a fundamental change in exchange rate policies and labor standards in the chinese economy as a critical first step toward restoring a level playing field where american workers can compete fairly

1557135 at discharge the patient proudly listened as her mother thanked luisa and the staff in a few words of new learned english
1557136 a lot of moroccans treat these customs like grandmothers folktales
1557137 they dont take them seriously but you cant just throw 500 years out the window
1557138 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1557139 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1557140 short term traders in oil futures are the fire behind the crude prices we see now
1557141 nafta and the nwo are quite real as is the european union and a soon to be global economy and collapse further indenturing the debtors and favoring our friendly loan sharks aka the world elite but theyre finding cute ways to package that little cupcake too
1557142 it exaggerates only a little to say that americans in their 20s and early 30s divide into two groups of about equal size those who are married the majority of whom participate in religion and those who are not married the majority of whom do not participate
1557143 marriage is a gateway into family life and family life in turn is often a gateway into church attendance
1557144 the longer people postpone marriage the less likely they are to attend church at a given age and also the less likely they are to attend church down the road
1557145 one thing churches need to do is to really encourage their teenagers and their young adults not to buy into this culture of hooking up and even the culture of dating or just hanging out
1557146 churches need to create a culture of courtship that puts them on a path to marriage for those who are called to marriage
1557147 i think connecting young adults to families who have different priorities and different challenges and different joys would help them see the world a little bit differently and hopefully grow in their faith at the same time
1557148 this market eats wishy washy sellers alive sellers should be prepared to let go
1557149 i should have had the real estate professional who listed my home turn off the electronic feedback feature he could have passed along any helpful information while filtering out the more hurtful and pointed comments
1557150 because i adore my house i just assumed other people would too
1557151 tread lightly on rates and carry a big rhetorical anti inflation stick
1557152 we did speak with one bank lawyer who said the liability is so extreme that its worth it to just let the house stay empty
1557153 we have foreign buyers as well as owner users that want to live in a unit and then rent the others out
1557154 theyre looking to maximize their real estate assets by generating revenue with outlying structures
1557155 i think as the population grows and the space disappears in los angeles and other metro areas its less realistic for people to have large pieces of property with a single home
1557156 when the risen jesus commissions his followers for their worldwide mission he does not say all authority in heaven and earth is given to the books you people are going to go and write
1557157 basically i believe that scripture is the book through which the church is enabled to be the church to be the people of god anticipating his sovereign rule on earth as in heaven and that this fleshes out what our formularies say in a three dimensional and energetic fashion
1557158 i commend the five act model to you as a creative and fresh way of understanding and using the bible for all its worth but it is of course particularly designed to explain how the great story of the bible is designed to point us to our mission and to equip us precisely for that mission
1557159 how can scripture form us for mission in tomorrows world
1557160 clear an over supply of newly constructed homes during an economic downturn
1557161 we urge congress to move quickly to conference and final passage of this tax incentive
1557162 failure to act quickly could further stall the housing market hurting many of our members who are predominantly small businesses owners and self employed individuals
1557163 three critical features for an optimal home buyer tax credit
1557164 if these measures are put in place many individuals who are sitting on the fence will take steps to buy a home this would not only help homeowners buyers and sellers but also it could expand activity as individuals furnish paint and improve their homes this would help boost the nations economy
1557165 this is as good a deal as they were going to get
1557166 once the final regulations are available from the agencies we will be better positioned to evaluate the scope of our participation
1557167 agrees that enactment of this legislation will help to stabilize and strengthen the housing finance system
1557168 this legislation will provide additional tools and expanded options for borrowers and lenders in addressing troubled loans
1557169 i feel its like one of my obligations as an artist to come to peoples hometowns and play my music for them
1557170 its always always a joyful time because there are no distractions its the most fun thing that i do i wouldnt say a 10 on the happiness scale but its always in the 9s its up there
1557171 its crazy how much gas has gone up in the past little while
1557172 we actually had to cut down we used to get a crew room and a band room at hotels just this tour weve only gotten one room every day usually theres a line waiting next shower its kind of bad but youve got to do what youve got to do to save some money
1557173 the marketplace has never gone down but were seeing major interest right now its a very robust market
1557174 and someone has already offered me 140 000 for it
1557175 i should tell him but i always chicken out do i invite him to the premiere or then does he feel like carrie at the prom with the blood dumped on her thats my fear
1557176 coldplay singer chris martin is acting like hes not upset but i heard hes upset
1557177 gwyneth paltrow martins wife wont even talk to me oh apples their daughter sworn vengeance my days are numbered
1557178 this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged
1557179 we will track you down wherever you are in the world
1557180 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1557181 dont miss this moment be careful to watch and i will make you see speak and i will make him hear

1557183 i have no problems and she is saving her time for people with bigger issues
1557184 oh you have two houses your mommy and daddy dont live in the same house
1557185 its a plan weve been working on for several months
1557186 were hoping this will really encourage people to move into the mooring field and comply with environmental protection agency standards
1557187 there is nothing in federal statute making it a federal offense to buy these purses
1557188 im not sure the message to convey is if you buy a fake bag off the internet that authorities are going to come break down your door
1557189 but do you really want to be involved in supporting organized crime
1557190 try to help him see the positive aspects of his situation
1557191 any time the teacher is made aware of how proactive you are about your childs education and childs well being i think the teachers become a little more engaged
1557192 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him
1557193 i am trying to do something different in the film which is a romantic comedy
1557194 i signed harman because he suits the character in whats your raashee besides i liked harmans performance in love story 2050 he is a great dancer too
1557195 she is a good actor but i think she has a lot more to offer
1557196 i am trying to bring something special out of her in my next venture
1557197 this film is a challenge for me as it is very difficult to make a comedy but i like to face new challenges
1557198 i am a big fan of hrishida and basuda i love to watch jyoti swaroop directed padosan again and again thats my favourite comedy film
1557199 right now i am not really interested in acting but i will consider acting provided a good character is offered to me
1557200 it was quite irritating that it seemed like a lot of the crowd at the paisley show wasnt enjoying the scorching last number
1557201 there were times when the crowd was so loud and into it yet during the final song when the band is completely roadhousing 99 percent of the crowd was just standing there i looked around and thought are you people alive at all i know it wasnt a song a lot of people were familiar with but the band was on fire
1557202 to talk with buddhists for example than with christian fundamentalists
1557203 the purpose of the discussion is not to win an argument
1557204 you ought to walk through the oliver and edna birge nature preserve
1557205 theres a nice nature trail there the birge family they were my mothers friends donated it to the community to save it from being subdivided and developed after that talk to jessie hadley shes done her best to cultivate and enhance a love of nature sans jet skis and snowmobiles
1557206 i always tell people its not about you or me
1557207 its about these guys in the back of the anti cruelty van our furry children who end up put in predicaments by people
1557208 a lot of people with todays economy they find it hard to keep an animal
1557209 some of them cant afford to even take care of themselves thats sad another thing is landlords youve had a pet 8 10 years and now the landlord says it has to go thats like getting rid of your kid
1557210 you ask how can you give the animal up they tell you weve got nowhere else to move to that hurts theyre crying youve got tears in your eyes but youve got to stay strong
1557211 hes had his shots if someone adopts him theyll get a good dog hes lovable

1557214 syukurlah hari ini hujan pasti sarabba ucu bakal laku keras
1557215 mungkin dia sedang buru buru ke rumah sakit bersalin karena sedang membawa istrinya yang sudah bukaan 12 di atas mobil
1557216 mungkin dia tadi terlalu banyak makan rujak yang pedissss skaliyya sehingga harus buru buru ke toilet karena reaksinya itu rujak kontan 15 menit
1557217 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1557218 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1557219 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1557220 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1557221 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1557222 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1557223 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1557224 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1557225 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1557226 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1557227 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1557228 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1557229 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1557230 will press hard for what i think is a very fair agreement
1557231 i strongly support your governments request to investigate last months shooting of a south korean tourist
1557232 the north american jet that flew obama and his traveling crew around for much of the primary season was refurbished with new seats and power for each passenger a must on the campaign trail
1557233 although farah started her career choreographing for me i never worked with her after virasat and now i want to bring her back from maternity leave and choreograph the srk deepika number call it a lucky charm the deepika srk song is special on many counts its first song that gulzarsaab has written for my cinema ive been a lifelong fan of his work my films are deeply influenced by him to have him write one of my songs is a big honour for me
1557234 this time the lyrics and the tune are ready for farah
1557235 but that never materialised im glad deepika debuted with shah rukh now i can use the hit pair to create some magic in billoo barbar
1557236 were not in competition with anyone kuselan filmmakers are bound by contract and hence cant dub the film into any other language
1557237 had the snake bitten lara it wouldve been disastrous but lara was sensible and brave enough to come out unharmed
1557238 shah rukh simply had to leave for mumbai and the rains just wouldnt stop
1557239 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1557240 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1557241 we hope to come up with a way to communicate across the scar layer and send information to and from the device in a way that is as friendly as possible
1557242 if you have lots of surface area you can inject current more efficiently
1557243 that means less demand on batteries but probably more importantly youre not recruiting the nasty electrochemical reactions that might be hazardous to surrounding tissue
1557244 imagine the cells are like m amp ms suspended in jell o
1557245 were growing the polymer around the m amp ms and through the jell o
1557246 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1557247 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1557248 the largest single site operation of its kind in american history
1557249 we roamed the plant for hours talked to anybody we wanted to the working conditions the safety benefits i found them above par its not the reality the unions are telling
1557250 read a letter i received this week inside the author had considerately attached a folded copy of prestons new york times article
1557251 it takes a day to get it out of your system
1557252 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1557253 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1557254 by christmastime 2009 youll be able to buy an nfc enabled handset with mobile wallet software already installed and go to any of those stores with contactless readers to make a payment by tapping or waving your phone
1557255 nobody can replicate the data or counterfeit a contactless card because its all based on the highly secured contactless computer chip embedded in the card which has a secret key algorithm that changes the three digit cvv cvc code for each purchase
1557256 everybody has gone through the scenario where theyve called somebody and just hoped they got voice mail so they didnt have to have a conversation
1557257 obviously social networking does not dominate life online despite the image that some of the more enthusiastic media coverage might imply in fact only seven per cent of the whole sample use the various mobile devices to do so every day
1557258 on the other hand this figure of roughly a quarter is still substantial given that sns have been around far less time than the more established uses such as email
1557259 the cellphone law came into effect april 1 and at that time there was a lot of education out there but now that four months have passed we are seeing motorists returning to their old ways we believe thats because it is a very habit forming trend
1557260 some people are under the impression its alright if they use their cellphone when they are stopped at a stop light or a stop sign your vehicle must not be operating and should be in park
1557261 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1557262 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1557263 theres no doubt in my mind that both incidents are related
1557264 we took photos with people from mexico germany other parts of europe even ontario
1557265 people recognize the rcmp uniform its world renowned some people told us they never thought theyd have the opportunity to see a mountie in real red serge
1557266 our main goal is raising awareness about impaired driving but this is a unique opportunity for us to promote pictou county p e i and the rcmp in general
1557267 theres no real past issue with people coming off the ferry drunk but this is a way for us to talk to them when theyre not being pulled over for a roadside check its a friendlier face for the rcmp than just seeing our lights in their rearview mirror
1557268 the kids love it the parents love it people are lining up for photos
1557269 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1557270 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1557271 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1557272 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1557273 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1557274 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1557275 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1557276 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1557277 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1557278 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1557279 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1557280 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1557281 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1557282 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1557283 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1557284 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1557285 i dont want sympathy or pity id rather have your anger
1557286 dont feel sorry for me im where im at because i made an adolescent choice thats it
1557287 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1557288 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1557289 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearized if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this
1557290 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1557291 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1557292 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1557293 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1557294 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1557295 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1557296 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1557297 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1557298 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1557299 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1557300 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1557301 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1557302 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1557303 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1557304 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened

1557306 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things

1557308 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1557309 we needed to win a game regardless of how we won it
1557310 we lost four straight and i dont think we played bad baseball until that last inning
1557311 thats not a good indication right off the bat as to how to go about that situation
1557312 youve got a four run lead and youre going out there to get three outs unfortunately i wasnt able to do that
1557313 lets not get ahead of ourselves thats how it is right now thats how its got to be nothing replaces what we had here in wagner so weve just got to hold the fort tread water down there until billy gets back
1557314 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1557315 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1557316 the fact is that there are so many different proteins and specialized sugars in the breast milk that the moms able to make that help provide immunity its very important for the health of the newborn
1557317 safma south asia foreign ministers association should talk to the nato forces and to the afghan government that they must not murder journalists and do not kill journalists
1557318 safma is a regional organization safma should broadcast the problems of afghan journalists to the world
1557319 we would like to look into those aspects and to implement them whatever is possible to implement as fast as possible
1557320 the problem with the saarc is that is very rich in pronouncements and very poor in practice
1557321 in fact now there are nine bureaucracies within saarc secretariat itself who enter the whole process they even do not fulfill their responsibility towards us being an associate body for example they do not like civil society intervention in the processes
1557322 and we must recognize that that we are trailing behind and not living up to the expectations of the people
1557323 and in pakistan it is in the process of being legislated but despite the laws as such the right is not recognized legally even if it mentioned in the constitutions and in other countries there is no law we want that this right is recognized and practiced
1557324 it is for the benefit of all iraqs people to hold the elections as soon as possible
1557325 our request to our brothers is to join us to accept this proposal and hold the elections this year
1557326 did not involve a single new dollar in tax increases
1557327 sorry but no i just cant even the likes of a ronald reagan couldnt balance out
1557328 getting this medal means that one had been recognized for their work and dedication youve put into this pre hospital care has changed a lot over the years now were treating patients 40 minutes sooner it makes you feel like youve helped them
1557329 we wanted to use these medals to recognize people who serve in high risk positions
1557330 weve already recognized police and firefighters recognizing ems workers is the youngest group to be considered for these awards
1557331 the build up to getting this medal is like a kid waiting for christmas itll probably be easier getting this medal than it will be to wear it
1557332 if the technology is commercialized as planned it will revolutionize concrete manufacturing and mitigate hundreds of megatons of carbon dioxide each year while providing manufacturers with a cheaper greener and superior product
1557333 considering concrete is the most abundant man made material on earth and that the precast market is growing the estimated carbon dioxide storage potential of this is 500 megatons a year
1557334 that is on par with other global carbon dioxide mitigation solutions such as carbon capture and geological storage
1557335 any material will be full of cracks and flaws only a tiny sample can be perfect and superstrong
1557336 we knew graphene was the strongest material this work confirms it
1557337 the main liability concerning the microprocessing industry is strain the heat is too much for materials to take
1557338 in theory a nanotube is rolled up graphene so it should have the same strength
1557339 all companies have that person down the hall to help with computer issues
1557340 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
1557341 it proves you can have a pharmacological equivalent to exercise
1557342 why dont people exercise when they know its good for them because its hard you feel fatigued
1557343 perhaps a product like this might help people who have a hard time initiating an exercise program
1557344 it looks like theyve been able to make fast muscle fibres act more like slow muscle fibres which have a greater capacity to use fats as fuel
1557345 who needs to lose a lot of weight or who is at risk of diabetes it may make doing regular submaximal endurance exercise seem easier to people who dont do exercise
1557346 if as i suspect people look at it as a substitute for exercise that would be bad news indeed
1557347 the doctor can hold it in his hand during the examination and move it up and down the patients body the camera inside follows this motion precisely
1557348 the greatest limitation of the current generation of capsule systems is the inability to control the device
1557349 a system that allows accurate and real time directional control of the capsule using an external magnetic field is a significant advance
1557350 the control field and movement are produced completely and without contact outside the body
1557351 changing the intensity of the magnetic field at a distance changes the position of the camera
1557352 doctors will be able to stop the camera in the oesophagus move it up and down and turn it and adjust the angle of the camera as required this allows them to make a precise examination of the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach
1557353 hey why dont we give youranus i mean uranus to aquarius
1557354 dear parents guardians this letter is being written to advise you of an incident that occurred between 5 00 6 00pm last night in the school yard a white male approximately 20 30 years old entered the school yard and threw two bottles containing an unknown ignitable liquid at the west wall of the school the liquid ignited on the cement sidewalk and slightly darkened the pavement and wall of the school building the suspect left the schoolyard and drove away in a small grey car the police and fire department responded to a 911 call from the spoke with all of our students and assured that the safety of our school community was our first priority our staff was outside during morning arrival and we required that all our students enter the building when they arrived instead of the usual routine where our 8 th grade students are permitted to go to the deli or stay in the school yard until the whistle blows this afternoon we will also be outside as usual reminding our students to go directly home from school i will keep you apprised of any other information as i receive it please discuss this incident with your child this evening and remind him her to alert an adult if they encounter a situation they believe to be unsafe to themselves or others thank you for your concern and attention to this matter anne marie iannizzi
1557355 a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time
1557356 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually remember his marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth

1557358 and he spake a parable unto them to this end men ought always to pray and not faint st
1557359 we really wanted to make it very easy for people to express what they wanted in terms of time we felt like the natural language approach was going to be more flexible and expressive for users
1557360 one thing this made me acutely aware of is how weirdly people speak
1557361 there are little things that are sort of classic when i say next week do i mean the week upcoming or the week after that the problem is not about parsing its that if you said it to 15 people half would interpret it one way and half the other way

1557496 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1557497 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1557498 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1557499 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
1557500 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
1557501 tamsyns free to speak out as much as she wants but if shes got any specific allegations to make about anyone she should raise them with us and well forward it to the ioc

1557505 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1557506 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1557507 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1557508 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1557509 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1557510 we will cooperate fully as we have in the past
1557511 sergeant moore as ive stated has respected the system and respects the process hes been very cooperative and continues to do so we feel that once all the facts come to light the situation will be resolved rather quickly

1557521 its been a nice resurrection for them and for him
1557522 he thought the first foul ball he hit was the hardest ball the whole at bat
1557523 if were going to win its going to take them to keep doing what theyve been doing
1557524 we wanted to win that game and somehow we did these guys cleveland have pressed us hard
1557525 its been a little difficult to get in a good groove especially today
1557526 i was trying to get back into the strike zone but i was unable
1557527 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1557528 i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1557529 were a good team and we havent been playing well things happen like i said were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1557530 these things could be very very beneficial for a team
1557531 yes they could be detrimental or they could be very very beneficial they sure can and not only for the team but for individual players i guess well find out
1557532 today i think we did come through a little bit
1557533 i was damn near putting it on a tee for them
1557534 what doesnt kill you makes you stronger as long as they dont cut your arms off and theyre still attached
1557535 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine the wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1557536 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1557537 if google have been careless in the selection of roads to photograph from they are exposing themselves to a range of legal concerns i was assured that they had been very careful in avoiding such incidents in australia
1557538 all the garage doors along the front of the block have sustained damage were already pursuing getting the doors repaired under insurance
1557539 i dont think theres much point hitting him over the head with it we might just keep it up our sleeve
1557540 i parked my car in front of an exs house when i was cheating on my gf at the time
1557541 ive got to put it behind myself its going to be difficult sleeping tonight no doubt but when i wake up in the morning its over and thats how im going to approach it
1557542 the whole game i couldnt locate my fastball at all
1557543 its tough to pitch if you cant locate your fastball
1557544 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1557545 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1557546 he soriano is a huge part of who were are
1557547 i dont want to say hes our spark plug because he bombs the ball out of the park but at the same time he gets us going
1557548 sometimes when you dont have good command and you dont make quality pitches itll hurt you
1557549 i did it earlier today probably around noon i was on the visit on the 25th and i basically loved the campus the people and the academics and opportunities after football
1557550 when i went up there the academics were real high and people know about stanford
1557551 people look at you different with a stanford degree there are more opportunities i can get some internships in the summer at a big time company if i want to and the coaching staff is putting together a great recruiting class so i feel like theyre going to be very good in the future
1557552 they said i could take other visits i may go just to check out some other schools and take a vacation i guess
1557553 it takes a big load off me because i was stressed but it doesnt really phase me for football i just felt that that was the school i would end up at so i went ahead and did it
1557554 we are thrilled to be the first to show consumers the best deals published by travelzoo in real time interactive projections the high impact and large scale of the wall projections and plasma screens are not only memorable for travelers who pass by but it gives them a chance to directly interact with the brand
1557555 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1557556 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1557557 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all
1557558 if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1557559 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1557560 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities

1557586 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1557587 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1557588 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1557589 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1557590 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1557591 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1557592 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1557593 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1557594 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1557595 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment
1557596 todays data are supportive of the rbas newly adopted easing bias
1557597 many dealers are taking advantage of the shortage of medical supplies to bring in counterfeit drugs into the country we have since confiscated a number of medicines that were already on the market but were not registered by us most of the medicines are not in compliance with our standards
1557598 as a quality control organ we should also provide quality services to our clients through well functioning equipment and motivated staff
1557599 most of our equipment have never been replaced since the 1980s and they are always down from time to time the ministry of health seem to have forgotten that we exist because we have been left out on a number of issues we last received financial assistance in 1997

1557654 recordemos que hubo una primera sentencia en el a o 2004 luego una segunda y aclaratoria en el 2005 en la cual ratificaba la facultad de la contralor a para imponer sanciones en la administraci n pero en aquellos casos en que el funcionario p blico sancionado estuviese desempe ando un cargo producto de una elecci n de primer grado no pod a de isofacto cumplirse la sanci n sino que era menester esperar a que culminase el per odo para el cual hab a sido electo y no podr a reelegirse

1557681 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1557682 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1557683 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1557684 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1557685 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1557686 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1557687 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1557688 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1557689 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1557690 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake

1557694 i strongly support your governments request to investigate last months shooting of a south korean tourist
1557695 when i die nobody will take care of my grave
1557696 well daddy you know that ill always take care of it as long as i live and when im gone hopefully one of the kids will take care of it
1557697 you dont never have to worry about your grave being taken care of
1557698 this is one of the most calmest places youve ever been to
1557699 to me its relaxing to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and worry and theyre sure not going to argue back with you
1557700 a lot of people might want to take care of their grave sites but they dont like to come
1557701 but i think thats probably the last thing you can do for anybody is to show them how much you care
1557702 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
1557703 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples taxes
1557704 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1557705 tomorrow you will take your role with us in our operation to attack al qaeda militants
1557706 we intentionally allowed them the militants to flee in order to create a gap between their leaders and followers from the chaos
1557707 when they get back again they will find no ground for them to work as we will have changed the area with this operation
1557708 when a person is arrested he has to be produced before a committee of judges at al jawal an iraqi army camp near baquba
1557709 we found them very polite and well mannered they politely asked us to get in the house we are greatly surprised and very impressed
1557710 at one point i wasnt on the bandwagon but i am now

1557725 no es una mol cula que la mayor parte de los seres vivos elijan

1557732 thank you for putting up with me i know what a useless pain in the ass i am
1557733 one must learn to love and go through a good deal of suffering to get to it and the journey is always towards the other soul
1557734 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
1557735 we knew we wanted a catchy tag line that wasnt going to be too risqu but would make it acceptable
1557736 when criminals are able to breach security systems they have enormous ability to cause harm millions of americans have had their identities compromised each year the annual costs to american citizens and businesses are in the billions
1557737 at the end of the day this is what we expect this will cost
1557738 we have cooperated with law enforcement since day one we are pleased they have been charged
1557739 conspirators to ensure they would not be identified and arrested in the course of that investigation
1557740 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1557741 this is the highest known density of gorillas thats ever been found
1557742 we know very little about ebola and how it spreads
1557743 we dont even know the animal that spreads it around
1557744 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1557745 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1557746 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1557747 the dump trucks are mainly used by the construction based companies for delivering the raw materials from one place to another thus you should convince the financers regarding the emergency need of the truck
1557748 the best financers should be selected who also provide finances within the shortest period of time
1557749 the list of the financers should be read thoroughly on the internet and checked for their rate of interest
1557750 once you select the best finance company its name should be checked via the better business bureau so as to confirm its history as a good financer this is a very important point to be remembered as in some cases the finance companies might endanger your company
1557751 thus after all the information of the finance companies are checked the best one should be selected
1557752 we can just pick up a guitar and break into song in really funny situations
1557753 no its not i wont find another one that was the oneeeeeee
1557754 plan was another example of how alleged conservatives will make fun of actual conservative values but the green one invited trouble by using a funny sounding word that the bullies had only heard at red rocker concerts
1557755 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
1557756 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
1557757 if i lift my kilt on bourbon street im much more likely to get arrested than if elizabeth takes off her top
1557758 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1557759 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1557760 since it preserves the amazon and the pantanal clearly defining where it can be planted in the latter region and without cutting existing production it seems to me that the agreement is good for everyone
1557761 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1557762 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1557763 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1557764 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1557765 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1557766 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1557767 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1557768 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1557769 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1557770 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1557771 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1557772 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1557773 the european commission has delayed a vital vote on protecting forests from illegal logging till september we want to make sure the commissioners dont forget about it during their summer holiday
1557774 take pictures and or videos of yourself and your friends spreading the love in a forest
1557775 collaborative video that well show the european commission in september
1557776 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1557777 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1557778 its a different kind of alarm call an opportunity that is increasingly rare on this planet to do something before theres a crisis
1557779 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1557780 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1557781 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1557782 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1557783 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1557784 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1557785 i might sound crazy every once in a while but ive got to take chances as an artist
1557786 people like prince stevie wonder and curtis mayfield came in and opened things up in a new way they werent afraid to take a chance
1557787 i had like three deals before things finally started to work theres something inside of you that keeps telling you you can do it even though theres a lot of things and a lot of people that are trying to beat that out of you
1557788 dream world is basically about my ideal world its kind of like a blues version of when nas and lauryn hill did if i ruled the world
1557789 you cant say oh i got to be in the studio at nine oclock because i go to write a hit it doesnt work like that

1557794 i see my relationship with her as being so much past being married when were together she makes me forget about everything
1557795 the inspection panel has clearly laid out the reckless manner in which wapco disrupted the lives and livelihoods of villagers in nigeria
1557796 we take satisfaction in the fact that the panel validated our claims and that the banks management accepted responsibility for allowing wapco to trample peoples rights but we still dont have an explanation on why such grievous violations of world bank policy were allowed to occur
1557797 the world bank should explain why it failed to effectively present the case for land for land compensation that bank policy calls for and should prove its claim that now after the mistakes are acknowledged there is no more land available for the displaced people even after reading the banks version of events it is hard to believe the bank did not collude with wapco to slash the already very conservative valuation of the villagers property
1557798 lets remember that wapco is not a struggling local enterprise but a consortium of some of the worlds richest companies including chevron and shell it is stunning to see them and the world bank deny impoverished people their due
1557799 the world bank quoted us the prices we should be paid and then reneged without consulting us they have sown confusion and despair in my community now that they are admitting mistakes they must publicly disclose how they decided on their valuations of our trees crops and lands

1557805 this is a residential neighborhood you dont run a lab out of your house
1557806 we advised him it may take several hours to resolve this and may want to find a place to stay
1557807 its too early to say right now whether theyre connected
1557808 what theyre hoping to do is find designs that are efficient designs and that are great learning environments
1557809 were just pleased as punch they picked us out of i dont know how many schools
1557810 its very attractive but its also efficient because half of that roof was skylighting
1557811 we did oversize those spaces just a little bit for say 1 000 students or 1 100 students even though our enrollment projections say 900 students
1557812 it just felt great that they recognized were at least somebody they want to consider
1557813 we didnt play particularly well in the beginning part of the game
1557814 but we were able to hang in there and make a game of it and almost pull it out
1557815 but whiteys a great kid and if we have a chance to hang in this tournament hell be back

1557819 youre serious you want me to vote for you when youve ruined the economy ruined our place in the world havent stopped terrorism made us kind of the bullies of the world and im supposed to vote for you because you have some phony baloney belief that gay people shouldnt have the right to be just as miserable as all the straight married people
1557820 wait a minute if you dont respect individuals theyre not going to respect themselves
1557821 clearly our deep national fear of hot man on man monogamy drove turnout among the nations so called value voters
1557822 its as though marriage in our country is only threatened during even numbered years
1557823 the sense im getting from a lot of quarters among the republicans is well we can do all this stuff now and well just make peoples opinion of us worse
1557824 this isnt going to happen for us this time we have spent all of the capital that the party has weve damaged the brand lets not go nuclear on this because we will just provide material to reelect a democratic president senate and house in 2012 and if theyre thinking in those terms there is at least the possibility maybe a third maybe a quarter that these sort of kitchen sink strategies on these issues will not happen because it will only come back to hurt them in severe fashion
1557825 i think the world has changed an awful lot in the past four years
1557826 im not saying that the type of initiatives that have passed in missouri wouldnt work in 2008 wouldnt
1557827 of course my good friend the vice president will be there
1557828 my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1557829 so i told him something simple you know what you can inflate your tires to the proper levels if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil we get from john mccain drilling right below his feet there whereever it was that he was going to drill
1557830 now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand theyre sending little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1557831 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun about a step which every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1557832 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1557833 they need to do their homework because this is serious businss instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and acutally make a difference
1557834 the girls didnt get a second chance why should he
1557835 it may be that the instruction was erroneous but i guess youve waived the right to challenge it by not challenging it sooner
1557836 we think that youve seen a fair and transparent process
1557837 this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1557838 we plan on charging at least 80 individuals down here
1557839 its degrading but you just gotta come back the next day and try to bring it with the same intensity
1557840 weve got to put it behind us its not going to help us tomorrow you just learn from your mistakes and try to move on
1557841 right now we are in conversations with a few teams and well see where that takes us
1557842 but our intent is to trade jamaal and try to find the right situation for both him and the franchise
1557843 hes a very talented player teams will give us a hard time because they know its better for him and for us to have him play somewhere else were confident that well find a good place
1557844 weve arrested him twice in the past to prevent this
1557845 its a stark reminder of how dangerous it is to walk on the tracks we take it for granted that these trains lumbering through the intersections will be easy to move out of the way of but this proves it is not
1557846 one of the fundamental objectives of the club is to locate the drivers who have ffvs and encourage them to use higher blends of ethanol this is the only way to increase the availability of new fuel choices and encourage their local gasoline retailers to provide e85
1557847 at a time when our economy is feeling the weight of our dangerous dependence on imported oil the flexible fuel vehicle club is a way to galvanize the millions and millions of ordinary americans who are already fighting back the use of domestic renewable fuels like ethanol in high concentrations like e85 is a major weapon in this battle to stem the flow of foreign oil

1557850 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1557851 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

1557877 there were alternative olympics set up in barcelona and they had gotten as far as printing the programs but then the spanish civil war broke out
1557878 the nazis they used those games in order to prove to their own people their international legitimacy
1557879 you may be seeing some parallels with the current games
1557880 there was a nonviolent protest and the government opened fire and killed about 250 people and the international olympic committee said this was a domestic issue and should not be addressed by the olympic movement
1557881 you can shoot down 250 people on the street but dont ruin our medal ceremony
1557882 people are completely oblivious to the fact that people were massacred in the streets of mexico city it shows how images and media can create our perception of a historical event
1557883 however that was an event that created its own history
1557884 if that hadnt happened you wouldnt associate the 1972 games with terrorism
1557885 the beijing olympics mark the moment in human history when china which is farthest from the political centers of the west both culturally and geographically is incorporated into the world system to a degree never seen before
1557886 because of the intense interaction and high level of collaboration with the outside world required to organize the olympic games many chinese people are just now realizing that their old way of doing things did not reach international standards and that they did not understand the west as well as they thought they did
1557887 the impression they make on the rest of the world is secondary
1557888 whats important is to show their own people the 95 percent who arent communists that the rest of the world acknowledges the communist party as the legitimate leader of china
1557889 if the u s president will stand next to their leader thats fine

1557895 you put up a blue screen how hard can it be but really theres a lot of give and take because you have to halt production to do vfx shots while everyone else is waiting around its an extremely long process for everyone involved in the cg department we had over 240 shots on this alone but we do have fun i dont think people will be able to tell if some things that weve done arent real

1557913 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1557914 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1557915 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1557916 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1557917 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution

1557930 clinton will count on the 796 elected officials and party bigwigs to put her over the top if necessary said clintons communications director howard wolfson
1557931 i want to be clear about the fact that neither campaign is in a position to win this nomination without the support of the votes of the superdelegates

1557935 continue to recommend weight loss for obese patients with heart failure even though this recommendation is not supported by evidence from clinical trials
1557936 lower cut point for normal is controversial and is sometimes cited as 22 5 kg m 2
1557937 because underweight malnutrition and cachexia are associated with increased mortality in chf
1557938 there are both favorable and unfavorable risk factors present in obese patients
1557939 our risk adjusted analysis suggests a protective effect of overweight and obesity in heart failure
1557940 this systematic review suggests that obese and overweight individuals with chf are at lower risk for death than chf patients with normal body weight
1557941 an independent study published in the new england journal of medicine examining that observational study which had looked for correlations between bmi and heart failure reveals that it hadnt been able to find a tenable link this epidemiological study had been based on 496 people 258 women and 238 men in the framingham heart study during 1976 9 and 1979 83 who had been defined among the cohort as having heart failure after excluding those with heart failure at the beginning of the study period and all underweight and young adults the authors determination of heart failure was based on reviewing medical records and information from outside doctors rather than direct to establish the diagnosis the authors used the presence of at least two main criteria or one main and two minor criteria their major criteria included nighttime dyspnea or orthopnea also due to a number of crackly lungs
1557942 may be misconstrued as indicating heart failure more often in obese persons
1557943 hi all this might be the last thing i ever post on here but i need to warn you all

1557954 im disappointed that it failed again the administration is going to have to consider whether it will put the levies on the november ballot
1557955 at this point we are going to continue with the renovations that we already have going
1557956 i dont believe we will put this on the november ballot
1557957 i dont know how we could have better expressed our message
1557958 some people who were against the levy spread a lot of disinformation especially in the last three days
1557959 i think it put a lot of doubt into the minds of voters
1557960 hes real i feel if i vote for him ill get something out of it no other candidate has held much interest for me but with obama i feel that many of the things hes talking about could come true
1557961 when gas is 4 a gallon and minimum wage is only 7 an hour its really hard

1557964 hes convincing the supporters of hillary rodham clinton that hes willing to take up the rod of change and remind them that hell be a great president
1557965 the underlying theme is to convince her supporters that hes equal to the task
1557966 he answered the questions honestly and it will help convince those who had reservations about voting for him that he knows what is going on here
1557967 hey lets force our will onto everybody freedom of speech for all as long as you believe like we do

1558064 artikel itu menghina penggunaan pembesar suara oleh sesuatu komuniti untuk menjalankan ibadat dan dalam konteks artikel itu yang merujuk kepada pembinaan masjid ia ditujukan terhadap laungan azan

1558093 pe l ng faptul c este cea mai mare campanie global este totodat i cea mai integrat campanie produs vreodat de orange n marea britanie n red prima ar n care a fost lansat campania mesajele au fost prezente n re eaua de distribu ie n publica ii la posturile tv i n mediul online
1558094 prin strategia de operator convergent i furnizor de con inut orange s a dezvoltat i este ast zi mai mult dec t o companie de telecomunica ii mobile mprosp t m brandul orange pentru a fi siguri c vom transmite tot ceea ce poate face acesta pentru clien ii s i
1558095 ncep nd din 2004 orange rom nia a nregistrat o cre tere constant i echilibrat
1558096 am f cut o promisiune ac ionarilor no tri i acum trebuie s le ar t m c ne inem de cuv nt
1558097 nu abord m pie e pe care nu avem anse reale s devenim un juc tor important
1558098 n principiu planul de investi ii prevede completarea capacit ii de produc ie astfel nc t s putem fi un juc tor n pia a de sucuri necarbonatate b uturi energizante i ape cu arome
1558099 dar n mod evident oportunit ile vor fi tratate cu interes nu exist o achizi ie bun pe care s o refuz m din principiu n niciun caz
1558100 negocierile pentru cele dou tranzac ii au fost interesante palpitante i pl cute pentru c s au finalizat cu succes
1558101 are notorietate i poate sus ine o cre tere semnificativ de volume pentru viitor
1558102 la carpatina discutam cu ac ionari care vroiau s se focalizeze pe businessul principal n timp ce la herculane discutam cu ac ionari care operau n businessul acesta poate din punctul acesta de vedere ultimul deal a fost pu in mai dificil dar nu mi dau seama dac n ansamblu a fost mai u or acum dec t atunci ine i de context i de experien a pe care am acumulat o ntre timp
1558103 este u or peste a tept rile noastre dar consider c majorarea dob nzii de politic monetar are i un rol de semnal pentru c majoritatea dob nzilor pe pia a interbancar sunt deja cu dou cifre iar un impact direct asupra dob nzilor la credite i la depozite nu este vizibil n acest moment
1558104 aprecierea leului care a devenit vizibil chiar dup comunicarea deciziei bnr va avea efecte pozitive asupra infla iei dar va accentua i unele dezechilibre
1558105 dou lucruri sunt esen iale n faza de preg tire stabilirea obiectivului i implicit n elegerea pa ilor care intervin pe drumul ce trebuie parcurs p n la atingerea sa i crearea ofertei de marketing
1558106 cred c primul lucru la care managerii companiei trebuie s se g ndeasc este aflarea publicului int al produselor sale
1558107 apoi directorul de marketing trebuie s evalueze care este cel mai eficient mijloc de transmitere a informa iei despre produsul s u pentru acest target n final este necesar o evaluare a resurselor interne
1558108 prima capcan vine din distribuirea bugetelor destinate marketingului zero la sut pentru strategie foarte pu in la sut pentru crea ie de multe ori f cut de un b iat care tie corel i restul consumat pe media
1558109 i aici vine a doua mare capcan cele mai mari epe se dau i se iau n cump rarea spa iilor de publicitate
1558110 i mai ales cump rarea de spa iu tv cele mai mari capcane cred c pot ap rea la utilizarea unor tehnici sau instrumente greu m surabile de genul evenimentelor unde efectul asupra v nz rilor imediate sau a brandului este greu de evaluat
1558111 fac diferen a i creeaz un efect dispropor ionat fa de investi ia n sine acesta este momentul n care oamenii de marketing simt c se poate i ncearc s multiplice acest succes care de obicei apare total neplanificat i n alte campanii
1558112 dac ui i s faci acest lucru i n loc s cumperi spa iu media n publica ii specializate te adresezi posturilor tv generaliste ai numai de pierdut
1558113 nu se poate spune cu exactitate un procent 21 potrivit statisticilor oficiale ale institutului na ional de statistic pentru c toate sistemele de m surare aplicate sunt relative
1558114 evident munca a beneficiat mai pu in de actualele tendin e de cre tere dec t capitalul ceea ce explic persisten a substan ial a ocup rii informale
1558115 consider m inacceptabil tratamentul diferen iat pe care cnvm l acord celor dou segmente ale pie ei de capital bvb i rasdaq pe de o parte emiten ii de pe pia a bvb care ndeplinesc condi iile unei pie e reglementate sunt admi i de drept iar pe de alt parte emiten ii rasdaq care ndeplinesc acelea i condi ii sunt transfera i pe sistemul alternativ de tranzac ionare

1558120 toate poli ele cu sume asigurate mici de c teva mii sau zeci de mii de euro le am plasat la asigur tori din rom nia n cazul poli elor cu limite mari apel m i la pia a interna ional unde exist experien a i capacitatea de a prelua astfel de riscuri
1558121 cre terea num rului de poli e nu a nsemnat i cre terea n aceea i propor ie a volumului de prime deoarece n 2006 am avut pu ine poli e dar cu limite asigurate mari deoarece erau solicitate de companii mari n timp ce n 2007 marea majoritate a poli elor au avut limite de p n la 100 000 de euro

1558129 ncas rile realizate de birourile teritoriale n primele ase luni din 2008 sunt triple comparativ cu aceea i perioad a anului trecut
1558130 nu am ncercat varianta facil de a stabili parteneriate cu cabinete locale ci am dorit neap rat s deschidem birouri sub nume propriu
1558131 am ales extinderea n teritoriu prin deschiderea unui birou la cluj napoca n colaborare cu nistorescu omlea amp asocia ii deoarece aici pia a are un specific propriu care ine mai degrab de o anumit atmosfer local

1558167 id love to be talking to people but i feel that right now the most important place for me to be is on the house floor asking the speaker we dont have our work done
1558168 its foremost on the minds of everyone that i talk to
1558169 my flagship issue as speaker of the house has been to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reverse global warming
1558170 im not giving a gavel away to a tactic that will do neither of those things that supports big oil at the cost and expense of the consumer
1558171 a comprehensive energy plan that will provide both shortterm relief as well as long term energy independence

1558430 how easy it should be for anyone who holds dear this inalienable right of all mankind to understand and support the right of the jewish people to live in their ancient land of israel
1558431 and what is anti zionist it is the denial to the jewish people of a fundamental right that we justly claim for the people of africa and freely accord all other nations of the globe it is discrimination against jews my friend because they are jews in short it is anti semitism

1558561 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him

1558574 if we complied with a demand to grossly exceed the well established market for drafted players we would severely harm the pirates ability to build the championship caliber club our fans so richly deserve
1558575 if we move the market from a range of 4 million 6 million to more than twice that for a high draft choice the pirates would need to pay that new market price next year then year after year
1558576 one thing that fans should understand about the draft is that weve only asked for 11 players in my 36 years of doing this to get bonuses that have exceeded 4 million or 5 million all 11 of those players are highly successful
1558577 and weve only asked for bonuses that exceed 7 million or 8 million a couple of times and those players are mark teixeira j d drew stephen drew and people of that nature who are all either stars or coming stars i think its important to have that context of the work weve done in the past
1558578 the draft properly executed is a major source of talent acquisition for a club like ours and the ripple effect of such an irresponsible action would escalate significantly our cost not only this year but also 2009 and beyond
1558579 complying with a demand to pay whatever it takes to sign pedro alvarez would impair the clubs ability to execute that plan
1558580 we very much want to sign pedro and continue to believe we will

1558590 sen specter remains the most respected statewide public official in pennsylvania
1558591 but his age 78 and health problems could make him vulnerable to a challenge from hardballs chris matthews
1558592 theoretical match up there is a large undecided vote and many voters dont know enough about matthews to have an opinion
1558593 his contract at msnbc is up in 2009 and chris spent an extraordinary amount of time in pennsylvania before the democratic presidential primary in april
1558594 i think hes testing the political waters when asked by various reporters he hasnt ruled out running he hasnt taken it off the table
1558595 would chris be the strongest democrat on the board right now probably because of his celebrity and knowledge of politics
1558596 but he has a lifestyle decision to make first and foremost
1558597 certainly presents a very interesting scenario given his appeal and his knowledge of washington
1558598 a true leader does not unnecessarily put his troops directly in harms way for purely political gain
1558599 leadership demands the courage to sacrifice for the common good
1558600 he needs to put the public interest ahead of his career interests we are here because we seek to serve not because we seek to advance our careers
1558601 we have tried to keep a positive message in our campaign we havent been slinging mud
1558602 but its difficult when a story like bonusgate hits the front page day after day it turns people off to know that our government is that corrupt
1558603 demonstrate the type of leadership that mr deweese hasnt shown throughout this crisis
1558604 is a further indication that others strongly believe that change at the top is a necessary step forward to begin repairing the breach in the publics trust

1558623 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year

1558627 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1558628 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1558629 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1558630 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1558631 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1558632 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1558633 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow

1558641 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1558642 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve
1558643 energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand
1558644 one more week one more barack obama reversal on a key issue actually make that two reversals so much for principles
1558645 how is he barack going to change the culture of washington if he cant stand up to those corporations
1558646 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework
1558647 additional offshore drilling would add 200 000 barrels to the 2030 production

1558649 they took the two small children in two separate vehicles they had impostered documents for them and successfully brought them across the border
1558650 ive always been a player who prepares for tournaments by playing matches and this time of year ive always done really well thats why this year and next week are important they will give a proper read on how my form is going in there
1558651 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1558652 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go
1558653 and we look forward to having the issue investigated further to understand the situation more thoroughly
1558654 the psa is not aware of any published evidence of widespread misuse apart from newspaper articles based on anecdotal reports
1558655 we have notified the family of margaret and seana tapp and a senior member from victoria police has explained the problems with the process that took place
1558656 social networking is in its infancy and im guessing it will become as widespread as email
1558657 social networking is going mobile and asia plays into that because often the first experience of the internet there is through mobiles
1558658 there is also an increasing sophistication in marketing it is the ultimate viral marketing and when done well consumers will spread the advertising for you
1558659 the opportunity to be global ceo of a company doesnt come up every day
1558660 what ive discovered in my research is and the department of veterans affairs has now acknowledged it there is a correlation between trauma suffered by vets and subsequent behavioural issues from their kids
1558661 they see their parents flipping out and losing it they see breakdown in marriages they somehow take an assumed guilt position and start to feel vulnerable about the whole issue
1558662 i believe this has impacted on this young lady and i think its probably indicative of what may happen to other veterans kids too
1558663 her dad was an icon in the 60s who was dethroned because he went to vietnam he paid the penalty for it

1558670 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1558671 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1558672 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1558673 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1558674 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1558675 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1558676 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1558677 new zealands high net external indebtedness leaves the banking system very reliant on non resident funding
1558678 it remains profitable adequately capitalised and demonstrates good asset quality by international standards
1558679 personal tax cuts and higher spending on health and education programmes will lead to modest deficits over the next few years
1558680 a weakening economy may also pressure the governments fiscal position however ongoing fiscal discipline is likely to remain the norm even if there is a change of government at the upcoming election
1558681 it is vital for the well being of new zealanders that their governments maintain investors confidence in new zealand as a place to invest in and to do business with
1558682 today marks the end of 30 years of work to see this rainforest preserved as a national park
1558683 today represents a huge gain for the future of conservation on cape york peninsula and for land justice in queensland
1558684 we commend the traditional owners for their vision determination and generosity in leasing back their land as a national park
1558685 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1558686 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1558687 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1558688 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1558689 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1558690 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1558691 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1558692 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1558693 it did seem a bit strange to me but i just have this rule that no one goes near another vessel
1558694 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1558695 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1558696 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1558697 without doubt id keep him hes 25 i think hes their best player by a mile
1558698 i dont condone what hes done but i would keep him why wouldnt you
1558699 theres 15 other clubs that would chase him and why are they any better to think that they could probably straighten him out
1558700 these players are so educated that has really shocked me theyve been just told and told and told
1558701 dids has ended up having to face the music over the last couple of years and unfortunately hes in that boat at the moment
1558702 whos more to blame in this instance the guy driving or the passenger is he guilty by association
1558703 he got into the car i understand he was in the wrong place at the wrong time but in the end if there was blame to be put on here i know who id be spanking moreso than the other
1558704 theres 15 other clubs that would take him on tomorrow and the ones that wouldnt take him on its because they couldnt probably provide the proper trade to get him across the line
1558705 that sized player and type player weve got plenty of so i think if were looking for a player from another club
1558706 im very happy and honoured to have stretched my career out for as long as i did
1558707 its the right time for the club its the right time for myself ive had a great run
1558708 when you look at the best and fairests the brownlows its self evident how good he is

1558711 to claim that many national championships among your group of coaches its kind of intimidating sometimes i guess

1558713 i dont know if you see that anywhere else in america
1558714 id trade the heisman for a national championship any day of the week
1558715 it was a dream come true to win the heisman but it doesnt compare to a national championship
1558716 yeah theyre heavy and they weigh the bag down its tiring
1558717 its a religious ritual an offering you offer these things flowers and such to the sea
1558718 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
1558719 the economy has been a sea of bad news for republicans and this is the first island of hope theyve found in a long time
1558720 i dont think the public view is we can solely drill our way out of this but clearly the republicans believe that they have a political advantage on this and they are determined to exploit it for all its worth
1558721 the question of offshore drilling along with expanded domestic energy production has suddenly become the biggest political and economic wedge issue of this election
1558722 there is some evidence to suggest that some poll numbers were moved by that because it is something tangible that non expert voters can see and appreciate

1558803 if you wanted to live footloose and fancy free all of the time you shouldnt have had kids
1558804 but maybe when i return i should worry a little less about how hard being a mother is and actually be a mother spitup poopy pants and real live tantrums and all
1558805 it was nice a different color jersey a different offense and different guys
1558806 you get tired of hitting the same guys all of the time
1558807 when you have a practice like this between two different teams all it takes is a little hit on a guy to get them to want to stand up for themselves i dont see anything wrong with that as long as you let it go quickly
1558808 it was a good day to come out here and mix it up against the raiders
1558809 its a little different playing against those guys we are so used to playing against ourselves and we got a little bit thrown off guys got a little bit out of themselves today coach nolan spoke about it after practice and so hopefully we come back this afternoon and clean things up
1558810 its good to go against another opponent and i think everybody stepped up their play just a little bit more today than maybe the other practices there wasnt that many mistakes its just a measuring stick i think everybody would say the same thing we still have a long ways to go but we like our progress
1558811 youve got to step up thats what it is its football
1558812 people go down and the next person has to step up you are only as good as your weakest link so youve got to keep working hard so there is no fall off
1558813 he was showing off on the play but he bit on the double move and i was able to come out of it and make the catch
1558814 it was a lot of fun competing against their first team defensive backs and going against hall another virgina tech hokie that was a lot of fun hes one of the best in the league
1558815 it was a lot of fun getting out there and competing against other guys but it starts back in santa clara
1558816 im trying to get some good work and earn the trust of the quarterbacks so that they know ill be in the right place and at the right time
1558817 hearing the terminology it all sounded foreign the first time i got out there in the huddle and alex called the play i just stood there thinking what did he just say
1558818 its getting easier just in terms of having those double days every day and having the same stuff pounded in your head every day things are slowing down
1558819 im starting to understand the terminology better and im just trying to make plays and earn a spot
1558820 get your mitts off me im not the running back
1558821 sometimes with a guy who has arms like that thats really all you can do
1558822 its different those showers come up to right here pointing to his ribs everyone was in there squatting down so they could get under it
1558823 if you can prevent them from catching a ball in one on one then with a little bit of pass rush it should be easy in a game
1558824 he ran a hitch on me on the first one and as soon as we turned around the ball skimmed over my head so the ball was out when we were running so i have to do a better job of disrupting that route because that ball was coming out quick
1558825 i love that drill because i think its an opportunity to challenge myself and challenge the receiver i try to switch it up i never want to give the receiver the same look every time i want to go up and press him and try to throw off the riming of the route the next time i might play off and the next time i might come up and press him again but with a new move its a chess game they try to figure you out and you try to change it up and stay disruptive
1558826 we just work on what the coaches have been telling us throughout the duration of camp stay square and try not to key the quarterback too much until its time
1558827 it was good work and fun to cover new receivers you have to be aggressive against this group of guys
1558828 it was a 7 pump route i used a double move the db bit and the quarterback threw a great pass
1558829 coach sully says to stay coachable and do what he tells me what to do so it was just to see if i could go out and execute the way hes taught me against our defensive backs against new competition it was fun competing against someone else and seeing different coverages but you do have to stay the same and not change your game
1558830 hes an aggressive corner he plays off sometimes and he likes to play bump and run because hes got great speed so i just had to go out there and do what i was coached to do and not play differently because of him coach sullivan said i did a pretty good job
1558831 its just sticking with your technique being fast and being physical they are known for being physical so we had to come out and be physical not just in one on ones but throughout the whole practice
1558832 when you have an opportunity to make plays make plays thats whats in my control when ive gotten a chance i havent had too many mental errors thats the biggest thing with this offense having it down and being able to execute the game plan and it gives you a chance to compete at the highest level i know all of my plays its just getting over these nagging injuries
1558833 super posted on new enterprise communications tools twitter conjoined with instant calling tm phweet

1558835 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it
1558836 if it were just a matter of my own money i wouldnt care so much but i ran out of money while developing braid and had to borrow a lot so i owe people a lot of money that makes the nature of the decision a little different
1558837 i think we handled the heat a lot better today
1558838 there is a long way to go and you can always do better we just need to keep working hard
1558839 he stood out a little bit michael smith had some nice runs deanthony curtis also made a few big plays
1558840 we can really take advantage of our group of tight ends
1558841 youll see them in motion a lot of times or lining up in different places that will definitely be a personnel group we use a lot andrew davie is an on the line blocker and can control the edge d j williams can run good routes down the field they are both good runners
1558842 it was good to get started yesterday our coaches and our players were excited to get out on the field obviously handling the heat and being able to practice as efficient as we wanted i wasnt as happy with the practice but we did get a lot accomplished when you go back and watch the video you see good things that maybe you dont see when youre on the field and were not working at the tempo that were working at weve just got to get use to that were bringing the freshmen out early about 45 minutes of individual technique so that when the vets come out and join them they know the drills and they can repeat that its an opportunity for them to get caught up and compete for a position thats why we do that at that i think ill just open it up for questions
1558843 we will definitely work on the physical part of the game i do believe that you do some type of hitting every day and you get use to it and you get better at it i believe thats how you stay healthy there will be a time when you quit doing ones vs ones and you do more of what we call cross over where you still have a very fast look with ones vs twos and the twos are giving us a different defense playing that off cards then theres a part where you go against scouts but we will always do some periods where it is ones vs ones but not quite as much as we did in the spring
1558844 they definitely worked hard in the summer in the voluntary workouts im not sure it all showed up yesterday simply because of the adjustment to the faster tempo and the heat and some anxiety there were certainly some guys out there trying a little bit too hard and when you do that you kind of wear out a little quicker i do think the timing of the passing game and that is certainly ahead of where the first day of spring practice was but like i said i think we have a long way to go as far as being able to keep our intensity our practicing with a purpose because there was a point we hit yesterday because of the heat and the fatigue that some guys were practicing to get through the practice as opposed to practicing to get better
1558845 nathan dick has really improved since we started spring last year theres no question about that he knows the offense better im impressed with his movement and his feel in the pocket again ive said this before we really might not know how good nathan is until its live tackle and he has the chance to move out of the pocket and make plays because when youre not hitting the quarterback you blow the whistle early or he moves and throws the ball when he could have run for 15 yards he has a real good sense of where the pass rush is coming and how to move i think hes throwing the ball a lot better alex mortenson continues to do a good job of operating the offense particularly in the run game he understands what we want to do he made a couple of good checks yesterday in that aspect the two young freshmen were at an all time anxiety high yesterday they were trying to go as fast as they possibly could so weve got to get that slowed down and be more precise with their footwork and just relax a bit they were both pushing and trying real hard and thats not that unusual that happens in the first practice they are both very competitive and they both want to do real well they just need to relax and become accustom to the tempo and the speed of the game
1558846 i guess i never thought about any deprogramming or anything like that we just try to install our offense and really work hard on his technique ive been really impressed with casey on how much his technique has improved and how coachable he is the greatest thing about him is he tries to listen to exactly what you say and then he tries to do it the next time that gives him a chance to keep getting better and really have a good year for us his footwork has improved tremendously when we tell him he needs to sit on your third step before you deliver the ball hes worked hard at doing that i think his accuracy has really gone up i look forward to him having a really good year for us
1558847 that allows you to be able to build our team with the young skill guys that we have i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game they give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball i think our defensive line has a chance to really grow and get better theyve had a very good summer theyre stronger theyre faster and i thought that adrian davis and jake beckett had real good practices yesterday and im looking forward to seeing our inside guys getting more work too
1558848 he is much more confident theres no question the last scrimmage prior to the spring game he executed well distributed the ball had an understanding of what he was seeing and where to go with it in the spring game for the most part he did a nice part he got bogged down a couple of times in the red zone he knows that we have high expectations for him and hes starting to have those same expectations out of himself like i said as long as he can see the coverage distribute the ball properly i really think his accuracy and his timing have improved a lot
1558849 oh theres a lot of teaching a lot weve got a lot of work ahead of us there was pretty good carryover from the first practice weve already basically gone through that two times already and there was good carryover they were communicating well up front so you knew they had an understanding of what were doing im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard i thought the running backs worked hard yesterday michael smith did a nice job and was giving us some good leadership out there deanthony curtis and dennis johnson i thought showed their abilities i think that weve got a chance to keep improving but weve got a long way to go theres no doubt about that
1558850 well its basically were going to be playing with an outside linebacker slash nickel slash strong safety its a kind of a combination of the three walner leandre who we didnt get to see a lot in spring ball in the physical part of it he was out there in the movement and looked real good and athletic at that hes kind of that size that we want i think it will be a good position for him dallas washington is about 218 pounds and very physical he came out of spring ball doing a real good job and then weve got some young freshmen to compete for it
1558851 well alex has got to do a great job of being consistent i know that he wasnt happy with missing two field goals yesterday hes back healthy he had a tough summer he had an injury that occurred and we went through that i think he will be a really steady force for us we feel like anytime we can get the ball on the 40 43 yard line we should get three points hes got the ability to do that the other two guys at tackle are going to be very good theyre doing a nice job and robert salinas is a guy that we moved from linebacker to defensive end in all our spring video he showed great ability to rush the passer is very quick can bend and will be utilized as a rush end and a little bit in our nickel and dime package where he can do both a combination of a linebacker and an end
1558852 leadership wasnt as good as i wanted yesterday but i think throughout the summer they did a nice job they worked extremely hard we voted for captains and we did a nice job picking captains offensively its not hard to know who they are casey dick and jonathan luigs defensively its jamar love elston forte and malcolm sheppard thats who they voted on for captains and we always do that the first day when we report to camp right before dinner and the reason that we do it then is we want to make sure they know who the guys are leading them through the summer who did the good job of organizing things and making sure everyone was there and working hard through the entire summer
1558853 no we do it where offense votes for offense and defense votes for defensive captains there are a lot of times where we didnt have the freshmen vote but since they were here all summer long most of them we did have all the freshmen vote
1558854 no the coaches vote we get the strength coaches involved with it and all the coaches get a vote offensively it was pretty easy defensively it was close and thats what we had three captains on defense rather than two we usually have two on each side of the ball but because it was so close we decided to have three captains
1558855 the first thing that weve got to make sure we do a good job of and im real happy with our knowledge of how to handle the heat and handle the humidity is that each day were careful and we do things right well always take a break during practice we have fans set up we get a lot of gatorade in them our new trainer joe sheehan spent 12 years with the jacksonville jaguars in the heat and humidity down there with all the heat and humidity down there he knows how to deal with it thats the biggest thing we weigh everybody in before practice we weigh them in after practice and then we weigh them again the next morning we want to see how many pounds they lost in practice how many they gained back over the night we had a couple of players that lost up to 10 pounds during practice and then they gain it back if they dont gain a certain percentage of it back then they dont get to practice the next day the first and foremost thing is making sure that the health of the player is at mind and we were going to do everything for that i dont think we can worry about wearing them out everyone has the same amount of practices but what you do need to do is as we get closer to the game we need to get fresh we need to get our legs back and we need to make sure we are at full speed its a real timing of when we want to peak and be at our best for that opening game and were a long way from there so we get to pound them for a while
1558856 i think well need to get a lot i really do when you look at our depth at running back you know they will have to jump in there and go and the great thing is i think they have the opportunity to be special players they way they can move their hands i was impressed with how quickly they learned how focused they learned how they paid attention to detail and the different things we have an opportunity to do with them at receiver weve got to get production from some of those freshmen and coming out of yesterday joe adams and jarius wright showed some real good signs showed some real speed joe dropped one deep ball but his ability to separate after you get 20 yards down the field is exciting for me because he really has that stride and looked like one of the fastest guys on the field yesterday
1558857 we were really happy with what he did hes the speed and size you want at that position talking with coach reggie johnson after practice hes very focused and really wants to play right now that helps a lot hes a quick learner too i like the looks of our freshmen secondary theyre good looking theyre big theyre fast you look at khiry battle and his physical size and look matt marshall hes going to end up being one fastest guys on the team for us certainly very flexible and real good hips tramain thomas is a taller longer corner which were trying to work to get but thats a real good looking crew elton ford eltons a guy that weve got to slow down a little bit he was like the quarterbacks yesterday he was trying to do everything so hard and so fast that he was a little bit out of control but he certainly is a big powerful young safety that i think will end up helping us as the year goes on
1558858 well you work on it you work on running with the ball after the catch you work on one on one tackling and open field run against the defensive backs which is a great drill for both of them you try to get them in a position where when they catch the ball theyre moving and catching it on the run so you can get more yards after the catch but we also recruited to it too thats one of the strengths that i really think jay wright is going to have and joe adams is there ability to make things happen after they catch the ball carlton salters is in great shape he looks faster he made a couple of real nice moves and runs after the catch which excites me a lot because he has sure hands he understands how to get open and that was the thing we really wanted to see improvement out of him in the spring was making yards after he catches the ball i know hes really making a conscious effort for that
1558859 jerry franklin looked good and his movement is good he has more understanding of what were doing so he got lined up quicker and faster a lot of times with linebackers the test is when you put pads on and then you start stepping up and taking blocks on and getting off blocks and making tackles i think for them when youre just in helmets its an easy day you learn more about them once we start hitting
1558860 one of the first things is how quickly we move on and take from what well have in the meetings today and last night to practice this afternoon we continue to install well be running new plays and new defenses and new things in the kicking game today than from what we did yesterday so the ability to really take it from the meeting room into the individual technique and fundamentals drills then into our group drills and thats why we end it each day with team drills is we want to see how well they carry that over a lot of times with young players they will do a nice job in individual drills your technique work but when you get into a group drill theyll still do ok and execute do alright there but once you get to that team aspect of it now things begin to start falling apart a little bit so we want to see them carry it over and execute when the entire team is put together and thats a lot of our coaching we want to make sure we have a progression of everything were doing and make sure that we practice and were working towards putting it all together as a unit
1558861 thats a lot of quarterbacks and ive not been involved with that many were going to have to let it play out for about 10 days and then make some decisions about who the one is who the two is and theyll get most of the reps and most of the work you need to get more reps for them ryan mallett is going to do as much as he can to get him ready for the future and we threw him in there yesterday at the end of what we call our pass skelly or the seven on seven part of it and he looked really good he did a real nice job hes improved on his footwork hes got a great release and throws the ball real accurate its going to be hard on him because he such a natural leader to have to stand there and watch a lot is hard hes just going to have to make sure he has a good redshirt year and he can either have a real good redshirt year or a bad one and he needs to have a real good one
1558862 hell get some he did some stuff yesterday the best thing about ryan is his personality is such hell go do whatever it is you ask him to do he was happy to run over there and give 15 minutes to the defense i think it will just be whatever style of quarterback were playing that week if were playing the running style and the read option style hell probably stay over with the offense if were playing the drop back thrower or the spread offense where they throw the ball a lot then hell probably be over there servicing the defense thats part of your redshirt year
1558863 its an area that we make sure we get the right guy back there and coming out of yesterday michael smith did a nice job he understands what hes suppose to do and weve got to figure out if hes the guy we want back there really i thought dennis johnson with the young guys was real natural a real quick five yard 10 yard burst which is how you get a really good punt return deanthony curtis i mean weve got some talent back there its just a matter of continuing to work with them find out when we get the live returns to see who can catch the ball when theres people running at them flashing in front of them and continue to concentrate i thought coach tim horton did a real nice job with the technique and the fundamentals on how to catch it it will narrow itself down well continue to work the whole group and sooner or later well figure out who can handle it when the pressure is on
1558864 no we had couple of new guys on that elton ford is a guy we want to look at as a kick returner he was a real powerful running back with a long stride sometimes we want to have a little bit bigger kick returner because you have to hit it downhill and have some guys bounce off your hips so well have a few more guys working back there on kickoff return
1558865 yeah they know theyre going to get the ball and the good thing about that position is there is going to be a lot of competition it will play itself out i thought we had a few too many hit the ground yesterday we expect to have a lot of completions we expect to not have drops and were certainly working toward that
1558866 weve talked about what our expectations are in the classroom and off the field and how to conduct ourselves socially and we continue to work hard towards that certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer we are not proud of and it is not going to continue
1558867 coming out of the spring michael smith was definitely the number one guy a couple of other guys had been injured a little bit i think our freshmen are really exciting deanthony curtis the first day out there shows a great burst and really made things happen same thing with dennis johnson i think those are definitely three guys that are going to have to carry the load and make things happen and play real well for us albert gary is another freshman who wasnt here this summer so hes a little bit behind the next couple of weeks will really tell who is going to step forward and get the most carries but we will definitely us all of them and whatever their talents are i think thats something weve always tried to do with our backs use them to do that
1558868 you could go all four years really our first two years at louisville we averaged over 200 yards a game rushing too so you can show them eric shelton lionel gates michael bush and coby smith all four of those guys made it to the next level and had a lot of carries its easy the biggest thing in recruiting is when you can get them in and show them film when you can actually show them film of the offense i remember sitting down and showing deanthony curtis our whole running back tape and all the different ways were going to use the back i think showing them on film is the biggest thing thats what i always try to tell recruits to make them show you on film dont let them just talk to you cause half the time theyre just telling you a story if they can show it to you on film that really helps
1558869 i thought it was good its a whole different level of intensity and level of how they practice they hit the wall a little bit but i thought joe adams came back he definitely hit the wall at one point in practice but he came back and caught that nice fade route for a touchdown he made some nice plays joe has a definite different speed he can go out when the ball is in the air something good to have out there i thought jarius wright had a real good day i thought he fought through the getting tired the best of all four of them and he had some good quicks and good change of direction the two big kids kind of hit the wall it was hard on them they werent use to that level of intensity and working that hard so those two hit the wall a little bit but i like their big size i like them in the release drill they showed some strength they could throw some guys around those are four guys that really excite you that could be a great class to keep those four guys around together thats what youre really hoping for you got two guys that can play fast and stretch and change direction and then two big guys that can be physical its very similar to some of the groups that we had when we were at louisville
1558870 oh i think its a little bit of everything the anxiety of going into your first day of practice theyre out there for an hour before the vets came out there theyre not used to going at that speed and level of intensity in the individual part i dont think it was as much out of shape as they have to learn how to fight through it when they get tired
1558871 rod showed some good things at the end of the spring and did some nice things but hes got to kind of as you said yourself he has to be consistent every day and go out there and play at a fast level he has a chance to be in the role its wide open once you get past london crawford and carlton salters those two have stepped themselves up above everyone else and after that its pretty wide open everybodys competing to see who will be the next guys are
1558872 definitely i think he did a great job of working hard all spring improved and got his footwork a lot better hes worked real hard at learning the offense learning the system he did a good job of getting everyone out there during the summer he ran the show and did everything hes worked real hard and his confidence level is up and our confidence in him is up i think hes really improved and we feel really good about him this is a big month for him its a big month were repeating the insertion of what we did in the spring so each day he should get better and better and feel better about the offense
1558873 oh i think thats a huge part of coaching youve got to put guys in a position to give them confidence in practice so they see themselves having success then they walk around with a little more bounce in their step and feel better about themselves everything is about confidence in anything you do and if you feel confident about yourself youre going to play better its important for him to have success weve always built our offense around the quarterback being successful and having confidence so we try to do things for them to have success early in a game or in a series to get into that flow and get into that zone and get to feeling good about themselves and thats kind of how we all are if you feel good about yourself and confident youre going to play better and coach better be a better husband or whatever it is
1558874 we really dont talk about anything thats happened in the past we really just move forward and try to teach our offense and we have a way that we try to teach it and how we work with the quarterbacks so we really havent worried about what happened in the past we have a big offense and a lot of stuff to learn hes worked hard at it and done a good job its just really important for the upcoming days for him to continue to improve
1558875 d j williams had a real good spring he did a lot of good things hes got to continue to go out there and improve andrew davie is a guy that runs well after the catch he does a good job of blocking at the point of attack ben cleveland came on at the end of spring and had a good day yesterday he ran around and had some nice plays yesterday had one blown assignment but he did some nice things theyre going to be a big part of our offense and were using them a lot of different ways so theyve just got to keep working hard continue to improve
1558876 well being accountable is being accountable to yourself to your teammates to the team and to the whole university of arkansas every day coming and going out there and getting better and preparing to be the best i think thats the biggest thing weve got to really make sure we understand as we go out there to the practice field every day to be the best offense in the country not just to get through practice when we can get that thats when we know were where we need to be were not going out there to get through practice were going out there to work hard and be the very best we can be thats what we need to understand thats being accountable
1558877 i knew that question was probably going to be proposed to me and stuff
1558878 we have a great anticipation for that young man the game seems to come fairly easy to him the more reps hes going to get and because of our depth there hes going to get a lot more reps hes come in here with an attitude to be a starter on this football team when you bring that type of attitude youre not going to take one play off and have a good play next youre going to continue to work hard i mean obviously we have that attitude at that position but gosh darn theyre so excited about being here and about understanding and learning the system and the thing about it is that where is different weve got older players here that are helping those younger players come along thats important if im an older player and i look over my shoulder and i see this freshman i can handle that two different ways i can either be a helpful factor as a team player and help coach that kid or i could be that older player thats a little concerned about getting pushed and shut that kid off weve got some people that are helping these young men besides our coach reggie johnson who does a great job but weve got some older players that are helping these young men and theyre not afraid to ask questions its always easier to ask a peer a question because youre probably going to get an honest answer youre going to get an answer of experience you ask a coach that kid might not feel like that question hes asking is not a smart question so hes a little shy and timid in asking a question so you either get those guys that ask questions and our approach is there are no dumb questions they keep asking questions and learning and you get that kid thats afraid to ask that question and that guys going to stay stalemated for quite a while
1558879 were playing this young man at an outside linebacker basically hes kind of a mix between an outside linebacker and a safety type position were playing this young man as an outside linebacker were still in a 4 3 scheme so were looking for a hybrid speed efficient connect the dot kind of player what weve got to get better at that position is being the stout player that were expecting out of that position taking on blocks quick to read understand fits so were looking for an intelligent football player where the game is a lot quicker down in the box than it is on the back end so all of a sudden if you take a kid from the back end and move him up there then that game is that much quicker snapping fingers rapidly to be able to connect the dots there youre looking for a guy that has a feel for the game and picks things up quickly
1558880 the quality of college football my last years in college football were about 12 years ago im not sure when my oregon state stop was in my career but i did had a break between my first and my next three stops the quality of college football is amazing and i continue to see that when all of a sudden as an nfl coach were getting ready for the draft and free agency or the draft itself and watching college football develop i mean it is so much more diverse than it has ever ever been and its a lot different from the pro game a lot different the fact that you have to play option football and read zone football you dont see that in the nfl trying to get involved and now that becomes part of my thought process thats where i really look for help from coach petrino because of his experience and our defensive staff thats been a big stepping stone for me and then these gosh darn hash marks theyre so wide now i told coach i think it was yesterday that coach and i had this conversation hey coach im not real familiar with these hash marks so i looked for coach horton and coach petrino and i get their advice on it but it is a growing situation for me in regards to that the attractiveness of this game now at the college football level is immense just because of the diversity i think you become a better football coach going through this level now ive accelerated and i dont see it as a step back for myself i see it as another growth period in my career im always one to sit down there and grow each day and learn something different the other thing is too is you have got to be extremely organized and youve got to make sure that our players understand the message of that because theyve got to learn to be organized not just with the game but also with school it keeps me on my toes i love to wake up in the morning and come to this job
1558881 rush the quarterback hit the quarterback what kind of pressure it depends on how we match up ive been in programs where you have to create pressure because your four down linemen cant get there thats a feast and famine when you deal with stuff like that if you cant create pressure with your four down linemen now all of a sudden youre back there and theyre holding on to the ball for an exorbitant amount of time an extraordinary amount of time doesnt matter how sticky the coverage is somebody is going to be open if we can get a development in our four down to be those pass rushers so were not always having to create pressure were going to be so much further ahead and have the advantage to pick and choose when do want to pressure again its just a matter of how well we develop and find those guys who can rush on down and distances that pertain to that they still have to play both phases both run and pass
1558882 i cut my teeth on blitz whether thats going to be the case here well pick and choose it goes back to the question i just answered when do we want to do it what personnel group do you want to do it with what down and distance do we want to do it i cut my teeth on pressure i learned that a long time ago that as a player and i learned that as a coach throughout my career you know as far as what we want to look at percentagewise maybe 60 percent non pressure 40 percent pressure each game its going to be something different and how we view our opponent you just cant go in and think pressure pressure pressure and again if we do that every single down eventually its going to jump up and bite you in the rear end youve got to sit down there as a staff and look at it see what the game plan is going to take care of itself were looking at a 60 40 balance that might be too high might not be high enough it depends on what we are doing but weve got to be solid like i said if were going to pressure weve got to be solid against all the phases its not just the passing game all of a sudden they have some options in their responsibilities theyve got to deal with as well
1558883 its a great challenge if we can understand what our offense does to be honest with you weve talked about it as a staff were probably not going to see a whole heck of a lot different from anybody we face our offense prepares us for two back one back spread those things if we understand our roles and how to get ourselves out of situations then if a formation all of a sudden creates a situation that weve got to get out of were going to see adjustment were going to see formations the only thing weve got to make sure were square on is peoples personnel we have some fine fine personnel on offense to be able to sit down there and judge our players against the personnel we have on offense at the skill positions day in and day out is a competitive situation so well be able to go into the game with confidence when we play whoever we play
1558884 well we got started and we found out we have a long way to go
1558885 we have a long way to go with handling the heat and keeping our concentration where it needs to be we did get a lot of things accomplished and it was good to see the freshmen out here by themselves we got them going with some individual drills and it looks like a good group to me
1558886 we didnt do as good a job dealing with it as we needed to there were times when the offensive line wasnt moving as quick as they should have been or with the amount of emotion they should have had
1558887 they both have really good vision they are very quick in the way that they catch they both have great hands
1558888 they were tired after the drills we did with just the freshmen fundamentally it was good to see how they fought through the heat and the extra reps they got joe made a couple nice long plays for us
1558889 hes tough the heat didnt bother him at all he ran hard for every play

1558923 they know very well that pacific countries are not ready to start any negotiations
1558924 we are still negotiating a controversial fta with the european union and a regional trade deal among ourselves we havent even begun to prepare our regional negotiating framework or undertake social impact assessments or reviews of pacific legislation that could be affected by a new fta with australia and new zealand
1558925 negotiations havent even begun and the australians are splitting the region by refusing to support a regional negotiating office and by holding out carrots like new workers schemes to gain support from individual pacific countries
1558926 it would be unfortunate if australia and nz were to use their position as key aid donor countries for the region to secure their own trade interests in any fta negotiations
1558927 we need to use international trade to enhance our development opportunities in the pacific
1558928 the australians are pressuring us to open all our markets to competition and to reduce our ability to stimulate local firms and service suppliers or to channel foreign investments toward local industry and employment
1558929 pressure to liberalize according to timeframes and frameworks promoted by australia and nz makes a complete mockery of the calls for good governance in the pacific

1558978 point 1 johnnie lee said in an interview that he was a intern for microsoft a year before the xbox 360 came out he then said that he talked to the xbox 360 developers to put motion control in there xbox 360 controller first counterpoint being microsoft what intern would beable to not just know about xbox 360 a year before it was released but was also able to suggests to the xbox 360 developers what they should include in there at the time next console
1558979 point 2 after seeing nintendos controller at tokyo game show he left microsoft made up a youtube account 2 months before the wii was relesed on november after the wii was released he started doing full time experiments on what the wiimote could do and youtubed out videos and releasing all info publicly on how anyone can do it that also includes competitors counterpoint 2 why leave microsoft and do full time experiments on the wiimote why would you release how to do it and it is very coincidental that all of a sudden he wanted to make a youtube account two months before wiis release
1558980 research interests are in creating enabling techniques that can significantly increase the accessibility of technology
1558981 last point amp counterpoint after all of these experiments and he found out how to do headtracking on wiimote why wouldnt he contact nintendo of what he found before he made the information public if you were nintendo would you want that information out to every competitor
1558982 reddevil3 first easy to do you said yet no one did it and all you said to me was opinion on jonnie lee what i gave you was facts from his own words and actions on what he did you might think he doesnt have a second agenda doesnt mean he doesnt and from what he did does look very questionable
1558983 began making these wiimote projects to release the secrets hidden in the wiimote controller
1558984 displacement mapping that nintendo patent for wii is to utilise the 3d processing for headtracking
1558985 a technique that is used to render detailed surfaces while successfully simultaneously keeping polygon count low
1558986 what you have seen on wii is just the tip of the iceburg
1558987 when the economy is bad we need to give back we want to be sure that we support this country

1558994 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimize its illegal occupation of
1558995 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken nonviolent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping as long as the chinese leadership continues its brutal occupation of and refuses to meaningfully address the issue the chinese government will not gain the international recognition it so desperately craves

1559001 when you are young you obey your father in midlife you obey your husband and when yo u are old you obey your oldest son
1559002 all theologies of liberation whether done in black or a feminist or a third world perspective will be abortive of the liberation they seek unless they finally go beyond the model of the oppressor and the oppressed the oppressed must rise to a perspective that affirms a universal humanity as the ground of their own self identity and also to a po wer of self criticism quite simply what this means is that one cannot dehumanize the oppressor without ultimately dehumanizing oneself and aborting the possibilities o f the liberation movement into an exchange of roles of oppressor and oppressed
1559003 asian women say that their emerging spirituality takes into concrete relational reality into consideration
1559004 there is no place for dualism between body and soul in this spirituality because it arises from womens everyday mundane bodily experience
1559005 it is hard to trace my awakening to feminism because it seems to me that i was implicitly always a feminist if by being feminist one means a woman who fights for her full realization
1559006 although i occasionally glimpsed a narrower and more authoritarian side of nuns most of my memory is of a cozy female run world where i felt myself a favored daughter
1559007 but secretly one suspected that their aura of superiority was a fragile fa ade a bombast concealing secret impotence
1559008 for endless generations women have paid public deference to male authority while privately not really believing in or counting on it
1559009 irish women let their men think they make the decisions and run the home but they know that it is not so
1559010 it takes a new consciousness to go back and isolate the whole body of material as a problem rather than as normative tradition

1559012 their gods are gods of the hills that is why they were too strong for us but if we fight them on the plains surely we will be stronger than they

1559017 and to be able to get input from several hundred women in your neighborhood on where to buy certain items or which items to buy can be a great time saving tool
1559018 we had only 97 lines for the call and they all filled up quickly this demonstrates two things first it shows how interested apis are in getting involved secondly it demonstrates that people want to engage in issues when the democrats do more than just go to people and say help us get elected when they actually ask people to discuss and debate issues it opens up a whole new universe

1559029 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1559030 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1559031 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1559032 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1559033 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1559034 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1559035 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1559036 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1559037 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1559038 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment

1559045 the foreign office has got information about cancellation of the presidents visit
1559046 the visit is cancelled i cannot tell you immediately the reason for it
1559047 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1559048 i told the president im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about uranium enrichment activities as well as nuclear testing and proliferation and ballistic missile programmes
1559049 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1559050 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1559051 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities
1559052 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1559053 i dont know what bush is thinking about invading iraq youd think that man would learn from his old mans mistakes good lord what an idiot i cant believe he is even in office you do know he stole the election
1559054 it is all about oil you know our soldiers will go in and rape and steal all the oil they can in the name of freedom hmph i wonder how many innocent people theyll kill without giving it a thought its pure greed you know
1559055 you know we should just leave iraq alone i dont think they are hiding any weapons in fact i bet its all a big act just to increase the presidents popularity thats all it is padding the military budget at the expense of our social security and education and you know what else were just asking for another 9 ll i cant say when it happens again that we didnt deserve it
1559056 well i for one think its just deplorable to invade iraq and i am certainly sick of our tax dollars going to train professional baby killers we call a military
1559057 i couldnt help overhearing your conversation you see im sitting here trying to enjoy my dinner alone and do you know why because my husband whom i love with all my heart is halfway around the world defending your right to say rotten things about him

1559110 the song is soft but chans voice adds power which is quite impressive
1559111 i chose the old ballad form which is simple and nostalgic because you can sing it no matter how old you are
1559112 when i accepted the task of composing the song i knew it needed to express a natural chinese feeling and give an instant look at chinese culture and history instead of just being a slogan
1559113 i remember when i was little kids in beijing liked to play with snails on rainy days when we caught one the snail usually hid its head inside the shell and we would sing the ballad while waiting for the snails to come out snail snail first comes your horn then the head just a few sentences its innocent its tolerant its full of hope and expectation this simple melody led me through the creation of the whole song
1559114 china is now the focus of the world and the song is for chinese people whose recognition is much more important for me
1559115 when he entered the recording studio we felt his humor and strength the song is soft but chans voice adds power which is quite impressive

1559134 he took ownership took responsibility for what was going on because it was a bunch of young people who were doing this as an outreach of the local church
1559135 someone made a scene that they were handing out the gospel of luke and they realized that these were evangelicals and an adult accused them of doing proselytism and thats illegal so that is why dr petrou was singled out
1559136 some of the legal things like this are being relaxed a little bit
1559137 and yet it still is on the books that it is illegal to proselytize
1559138 even though they were sharing the gospel it wasnt forced and it wasnt coerced in any way it wasnt taking advantage of people who might not understand what it is they were receiving
1559139 in fact what was being given out was a gospel of luke with a letter that explained who they were with the church one of the largest churches evangelical churches in greece and so because of their transparency the judge ruled in dr petrous favor
1559140 when youre part of that church it really is part of who you are part of your identity
1559141 just because of the nature of the church and the power it holds over the people and even the blindness of not truly understanding saving faith it is a difficult soil it is a hard ground to work
1559142 theyre effective because they know best how to reach their people
1559143 dr petrou has been part of the evangelical community for years
1559144 he really is seen as one of the leaders of the evangelical community hes written many books hes been involved with the director of a publishing company hes well known in the community im sure that this case was well publicized within the community of believers there and that most people were very encouraged by the outcome
1559145 thats one of the sacrifices this family has made to serve the lord and to obey god to help train young people the next generation
1559146 amg began in greece over 65 years ago and it is a very needy mission field
1559147 its kind of in the center of the world if you look at a map and greece is a very strategic place to promote missions to see what gods doing around the world to be actively involved in it
1559148 the rapid flow of capital from west to east where more than a billion dollars a week for instance flows in to china to establish new businesses continues to sustain these challenges
1559149 adopting effective people strategies to address these challenges will be critical to leveraging the full potential of the regions workforce and to sustained corporate competitiveness

1559151 air safety administration and certification isnt actually the only important reforms proposed by the draft legislation
1559152 its too early to say the oil scare is over prices need to come off more before the inflation threat is over
1559153 were keeping our fingers crossed that at least prices can steady at the recently lower range or slip a little further
1559154 american demand for oil in the past six weeks has been falling for the first time in 15 years americans are not driving around a lot and when they do they do so in smaller cars
1559155 group exhibition at nomad art gallery summer art show brings out beauty of eastern culture
1559156 our main focus is to promote art and culture through indigenous crafts and thematic paintings as this country is in dire need of promoting its true identity especially at this crucial time
1559157 inflation is expected to peak in early fourth quarter and then start moderating
1559158 we do in fact expect inflation to top out between 13 and 14 by the early fourth quarter so that there is still some upside to this headline reading
1559159 as expected inflation in july recorded another increase following the additional shock of typhoon frank on food commodities this was most pronounced in areas outside metro manila
1559160 the services spurt was underpinned by another bout of transport fare increases along with retail pump prices in the month so a combination of imported and domestic pressures is at play
1559161 the caveat however is that there had been a lot of delays in the fulfillment of pronouncements of higher oil supply but so far there is no word that non opec countries would again miss the fourth quarter timetable
1559162 monetary policy will continue to be appropriately tight until we see a more benign outlook and manageable inflation expectations
1559163 price movements of fuel while remaining high are beginning to show some easing

1559266 theyre going to have a coffee shop and a restaurant our business will go under
1559267 where did you how did you know what to get
1559268 my cousins a chef at a restaurant in westminster and he helped me a bit
1559269 did you or did you not miss whyte apply for a transition of business from novel merchant to food serving establishment
1559270 and you did recieve a licence to serve food in your establishment
1559271 where is your culinary approval certificate or if you have it a degree in culinary arts
1559272 i graduated from the culinary school of excellence with a degree in excellent
1559273 we know that all things work for good for those who love god who are called according to his purpose
1559274 one concern that was kind of a surprise was jameel cook
1559275 he had a little knee cleanup during the season and then he developed an infection a few weeks later which was a big set back but we still felt like he would be fine but thats not the case
1559276 he could be a week 10 days two weeks from being able to play
1559277 after making a few visits i think i told you i visited vanderbilt last week i knew wake was right the whole time i figured wake forest was where i wanted to be but i had to be sure
1559278 i really like the coaches at wake forest and they had a little advantage because my brother goes there and he could tell me about it
1559279 he could tell me things and fill in questions that other schools couldnt i felt like wake was where i wanted to be and i fit in with the coaches and players there
1559280 hes actually the first person i called when i talked to coach hood
1559281 when i talked to coach hood from wake he said that i could play either linebacker or defensive end right now he wants to play me at defensive end because he thinks i can get on the field faster there
1559282 i went up there with my dad to take a look at the campus
1559283 i had looked at the campus a little when i was up there at a camp in june but wanted to see the rest of it before i made my decision
1559284 i came back and talked to my dad about it and we called them friday and told them i want to come up there
1559285 i really made my decision on the way back home but decided to take a couple of more days
1559286 ive gotten several offers but they are the only big time football school to offer me a scholarship
1559287 they are the acc champions and they play in bowl games so im really excited about being a part of their program
1559288 coach grobe is a really great coach and their coaching staff is really stable
1559289 most of their coaches have been with him for a long time coach grobe just signed a 10 year contract so i know hes going to be there
1559290 they have a 10 1 teacher student ratio so im not going to be in huge classes where you cant ask a question if you dont understand something its small and i like that you can get to know everyone there
1559291 they red shirt about 97 percent of the freshmen so i have no problem with that
1559292 its just an extra year of a great education that will be paid for the acc is one of the best conferences in the nation so it will be a lot of great competition each week i just want to go up there and get better and fight for a starting spot
1559293 the way coach cathcart runs the program has made all of us better and he has brought a lot of exposure to the program
1559294 i wouldnt be getting the opportunity to play college football if it werent for coach warbington he is a great coach and he has helped me become a good player wakes offensive line coach steed lobotzke is a lot like coach warbington so im looking forward to playing for him
1559295 having tavarres king and daniel franklin have helped the rest of us get a lot of exposure from college coaches
1559296 they are such great players that having them on the team has given exposure to the rest of us
1559297 gabe has been a stellar player for us and hes also a tremendous student and an exceptionally well rounded school leader hes getting a chance to play for one of the finest coaching staffs in the country at an outstanding school just like tavarres and daniel we are very excited and proud of gabes decision

1559320 easy love well just see where we end up i mean if this is a time machine maybe we can figure out how it works and first see where we end up i mean if were going back into time or forward
1559321 how you can be calm at a time like this is amazing
1559322 i think i recall crumhorns last thoughts about setting a trap for dm and it had to do with sending him back to the beginning of time
1559323 if i boost you up maybe you can make sense of this thing see if there are any numbers or anything
1559324 rats i recognize the letters alpha and omega and zeta but the needle is pushed all the way towards alpha

1559329 you do not know the man laughed but there was sadness in his eyes
1559330 i call this place the garden and all about me is the world im supposed to take care of you the creatures and it as what he said a steward thats what he said
1559331 the unnamed one because if you speak his name you may know death itself
1559332 now i must find names for the others i shall see you later
1559333 i present her to you she is of your flesh and you and she shall be helpmates like a father presents his daughter to her bridegroom and when they are married they become one flesh one body so you have her at your side to help you in the work i have given you to do
1559334 be fruitful and multiply and take care of my garden and all the creatures in it

1559339 i believe give or take 4 years owing to not knowing the exact time of birth of jesus that were back nearly six thousand years
1559340 with my luck well end up at the year zero
1559341 if its four thousand 4 bc and our year is 5764 and maybe if i moved it darn it is stuck
1559342 i hope wherever we are we can find some tools
1559343 using this as zero and if you moved that lever halfway youd get the year 2882
1559344 man was created on the first of tishrei which is signified by rosh hashonah and if we are at the first of tishrei in the first year then we can use that as a time scale because your gregorian calendar was messed up

1559346 only hours or minutes away and the paradise is gone and mankind falls
1559347 heh we still have a choice what we make of it is our business
1559348 i still dont get that but i do know about the whole idea of the sins of the forefathers coming unto the seventh generation
1559349 well if we are going to end up in 2828 i think you can figure out when that is some time during the roman empire

1559351 the recent claims brought by essential entertainment have come as quite a shock considering we were under the impression that they were acting as the foreign sales company for the picture what is even more shocking is that they are naming parties and companies such as ours which are not even liable for any of their claims justin and i were brought on and hired as producers on the project just like oliver stone further i was under the impression that one had to actually do something wrong to get sued
1559352 if you have something to tell me we should talk about it now

1559354 see the republicans will be able to attack obama on something

1559454 all the suites had dirty cells and inadequately cleaned showers there was limited access to showers and toilet paper and all staff did not carry ligature knives and none routinely carried keys
1559455 this problem was acute at southwark a suite run entirely on overtime and which in spite of an earlier extremely critical internal report was still unfit for use being both unhygienic and unsafe
1559456 conditions in the cells were squalid and lacked decency there was hair and pubic hair on mattress plinths and congealed blood and human waste on some walls
1559457 the forensic medical examination room at southwark contained layers of dust tablet packets were strewn around and two packs of dna which should have been frozen were kept in a fridge mixed with foodstuff
1559458 southwark custody suite should be closed until the fundamental deficiencies identified in this report are remedied

1559464 we have identified several clients who would be willing to be first to sell a plan
1559465 but the question is when is a good time for this
1559466 in the wake of the subprime crisis it would be crazy to allow financial institutions to manage these plans
1559467 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
1559468 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
1559469 the most difficult thing to resolve is whether there is an effect with long term mobile phone use
1559470 its time for the interphone to come out its a public health issue
1559471 fifteen years ago you would never hear the word branding maybe at 1 of the campuses
1559472 the institution is not behind an ivy covered wall any more it has thousands of touch points available on the internet to untold constituencies all of the time
1559473 its more apparent that without some management and institutional command about their message its all over the place
1559474 the problem is theyre advertising these unbelievably low premium health insurance plans
1559475 all youre doing its transferring risk to yourself so your monthly premiums are lower
1559476 but our confidence and ambition is buttressed by a very healthy balance sheet
1559477 there are significant opportunities to raise advertising revenues increase circulation volume and revenues and to reduce subscriber churn in several markets around the world
1559478 these are very good times for scotch whisky the whole world with one or two exceptions is really embracing it in its different forms we are seeing growth at all levels

1559482 taking money from your retirement accounts before you retire is like robbing yourself to pay yourself
1559483 its generally not a good idea to stop contributions to your retirement accounts because you lose out on compound interest and your employer match too
1559484 if you have the right disability protection in place then you wont have to worry about liquidating or discontinuing your retirement savings because of a debilitating injury or illness
1559485 most employees can secure group coverage for just a few dollars each month and then supplement their discounted group insurance with an individual policy
1559486 most employees and business owners can purchase a top quality individual policy for significantly less than what they spend on gas each month the point is in challenging economic times it is more important than ever to ensure your greatest asset your ability to earn an income
1559487 theres potential promise that vitamin c is part of the armamentarium for treating some cancers
1559488 which ones weve got to do more and find out
1559489 the body wants to get to a certain place and no more
1559490 short circuiting the bodys normal control mechanisms and finding theres an unexpected surprise that may be beneficial
1559491 should patients with any kind of tumor go out and get iv ascorbate vitamin c thats not the message here
1559492 like so many things that are intriguing or appear to be promising there appears to be a long way to go from the theory in the lab to the practical application in the clinic
1559493 people in the area arent going to spend as much on items they dont have to have
1559494 there are plenty of other areas you can go to and not have that increase so its definitely a concern for us in la mesa
1559495 no way theyre going to reduce this tax at the end of three years
1559496 once they get the sales tax increase theyll get comfortable with it like a heroin addict that gets used to a bigger dose
1559497 im concerned that increasing the sales tax could further inhibit our economic recovery and affect retail sales but it is good to see the governor finally engaging in a real discussion of revenues to provide critical services to the people of our state
1559498 it is the lucky baby that nurses to age two

1559500 the rules before meant that the supervisors had 30 days to come up with eight votes and thats a very tough thing to do
1559501 the fact that dick sklar had to get six votes when he barely got four votes in february is why he withdrew his name and if you look at the way the supervisors handled the process last time around this time they seem more vested in it
1559502 i was not persuaded that the prepayment was not a deposit
1559503 what they are actually doing is asking for a security deposit again under the guise of an employment development department requirement but the edd guidelines are just that guidelines
1559504 prepay to lease a taxicab for a period of at least 28 days
1559505 been talking to an attorney and hopes to bring an injunction against yellow cab
1559506 any kind of prepayment policy is against the tracy decision
1559507 they are trying to make themselves look better by pushing back the deadline but the fact is that yellow cab wants to establish a precedent of prepayment and that is illegal
1559508 the charity agrees to it because they want the easy money that they dont have to do any work for
1559509 then the person goes out and spends 1 million to get that 200 000 and the charity tries to rationalize it by saying well its money we wouldnt normally have we dont have staffing for fundraising but theyre ripping off the public and disrespecting the intentions of the people who gave that money
1559510 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps
1559511 we were surprised by the objections of some other members
1559512 i believe this new proposal will be agreed by all the parties because we have reached a dead end and there must be a new solution
1559513 indeed it happens offline too once any community gets big enough to be worth the effort itll start attracting the attention of marketers like spammers or the con artists
1559514 and i think a significant factor is that on twitter people forward links to their friends very quickly almost like a reflex action sometimes even before looking at them themselves
1559515 this means that twitter participants afford each other a high degree of trust
1559516 the twitter community has also created an environment of reciprocal following
1559517 for many twitter participants this has become a form of unspoken etiquette unfortunately this behaviour can open that person and their entire network to the type of exploitation described in your article
1559518 why follow back someone you cant validate i dont and why click on their links

1559526 i was in the air force stationed in iceland and had a chance to go to italy for a few days with my family
1559527 my wife and i wanted to go to a free concert but we had two little boys and didnt know how to get a baby sitter the innkeepers were the sweetest couple and after a bit of exchanging words we figured out they were offering to keep the boys for us
1559528 when i did get around to planning my trip i decided to take some italian classes so i could understand the language and get around easier
1559529 besides getting better with the language the advance class brings bottles of wine to share during the lessons everyones italian gets better with a little wine its more relaxed
1559530 it really keeps you on your toes to practice weekly
1559531 i dont have any desire to go to any other country
1559532 the food is always so good and of course the wines in italy are wonderful and the people are the warmest its much more fun when you can speak the language too
1559533 some nights we have 19 people and other nights there might be five
1559534 were going to italy for the first time and wanted to learn some italian before we went
1559535 were going to have a great mother and daughter adventure and to see the great masterpieces of renaissance art and architecture while traveling through the wine country of tuscany
1559536 we are thrilled to have this opportunity and are so excited to experience italian culture

1559575 in our judgment the derivation of stem cells from embryos remaining following infertility treatments is justifiable only if no less morally problematic alternatives are available for advancing the research the claim that there are alternatives to using stem cells derived from embryos is not at the present time supported scientifically we recognize however that this is a matter that must be revisited continually as the demonstration of science advances

1559581 the voters spoke two years ago saying they wanted to go in a new direction
1559582 the voters here know me they know what i stand for and what ive done
1559583 i think the big difference was that the electorate was able to see that my opponent did not have the experience i had
1559584 theres a huge difference between being a city prosecutor and a state prosecutor
1559585 if you are truly my friend then you would cut a check to the campaign if you do not then its time i checked you either you are with me or against me

1559590 we had to juggle his schedule so i could bring her in
1559591 we came together to try to see if we could work it all out and move forward
1559592 we came together decided on what roles everybody would play and basically came to an agreement of who would do what so that we could be focused more on the peoples business rather than the caucus business
1559593 i like being engaged in the procedural workings on the floor i like talking with caucus members etc
1559594 sen eric johnson taught us the strength of the warrior was in the tribe we have worked as a team keeping that in mind every member has contributed by serving where their skills best contribute to the success of our team

1559598 i am proud to serve with such a distinguished group of individuals that can so professionally put people in the roles where they can best contribute
1559599 just what an elementary school should have been like there was not a lot of pressure and we had a lot of fun especially on the playground
1559600 if youre behind or around a school bus expect it to stop
1559601 we had more rear end collisions last year because people either stopped to pick their dropped cd off the floor and hit the rear of the bus or they were following too closely
1559602 if a bus driver calls in and says they cant hold any more were going to send out these other buses to finish the route

1559622 we have not seen the judgement yet but it is a complete shock to us i cant believe this can happen the decision has really came at the wrong time when we are in hot pursuit of simi members in the country
1559623 investigations suggest the hand of simi activists in recent terror bombings in the country the decision will send a wrong message down the line
1559624 we have not been informed about the judgement but it is a big setback for the security agencies which are battling terrorism
1559625 we have provided adequate information to the tribunal that lifted the ban and the decision is very surprising it will badly affect us in the long run in the fight against terrorism
1559626 we fear that simi activists would raise their head again and this time it would be an open peril for everyone
1559627 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
1559628 i said who else can i speak to about this and they said there is no other recourse
1559629 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1559630 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing

1559652 his selection is just reward because he showed his form in the super 14 and currie cup i would never bring a player in if i did not think he would be an asset i trust jongi and back him and i believe he will step up to the occasion

1559655 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1559656 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1559657 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1559658 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1559659 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1559660 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1559661 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1559662 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1559663 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1559664 almost all our players play in europe so it would be much easier for us to join the six nations
1559665 but we are also in the southern hemisphere and it would be great to join the tri nations
1559666 but then we would never get a holiday because we would be playing tri nations when our clubs are on holiday and we would never get a break
1559667 our clubs would not be happy and in this professional era they are our bosses it is a really difficult decision

1559739 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities

1559762 remember we made the house a place of assembly for men and a place of safety and take ye the place of abraham as a place of prayer and we convenanted with abraham and ishmael that they should sanctify my house for those who compass it round or use it as a retreat or bow or prostrate themselves therein in prayer
1559763 this black stone has been the cause of much misunderstanding among non muslims who believe it to be a fetish taken over by muhammad as a concession to the pagan meccans nothing could be further from the truth just as the kabah is an object of reverence but not of worship so too is the black stone it is revered as the only remnant of abrahams original building and because the lips of muhammad touched it on his farewell pilgrimage all pilgrims have done the same ever since
1559764 i know that you are a stone incapable of doing good or harm had i not seen the messenger of god kissing you i would not have done so
1559765 taking the bus and not being in control of my own schedule and many people recognising me in the village it was not as enjoyable as sydney which i loved
1559766 its not because federer doesnt like living in the olympic village its because he has his own habits and prefers to live by himself
1559767 its very different from the regular tournaments on the tour you are in the olympic village so its always very nice to be with the rest of the sportsmen of the world
1559768 quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why theyre doing that
1559769 having made the decision to play in the olympics i wouldnt want to be staying anywhere other than in the athletes village it will be a great experience to be around the best athletes in the world and to speak to some of them
1559770 in 2004 we were kind of disassociated with everyone because we were staying on a ship and not with everyone in the olympic village
1559771 this year were going to be a little more open to it were going to try to have a little more fun and enjoy it
1559772 we dont intend to make a whole lot of friends here
1559773 the olympic spirit is beating people not living with them
1559774 i had set out for the mines of the king in a ship 180 feet long and 60 feet wide we had a crew of 120 the pick of egypt a storm broke and we flew before the wind the ship went down of all in it only i survived i was cast upon an island then i heard the sound of thunder and thought it was a wave trees broke and the earth quaked i uncovered my face and found a serpent it was 45 feet long and its beard was two feet long its body was covered with gold and its eyebrows were real lapis lazuli
1559775 that there really was a sailor called sindbad who had some adventures
1559776 the sindbad chroniclers took one captain and added other adventures to his own
1559777 we were sitting off the coast of newfoundland when i suddenly realized i had a winner building and sailing replicas of ancient boats
1559778 i had written to tell them about my project but apparently they had forgotten
1559779 people thought i was mad but it was the only way i could tell it had been soaked in salt water
1559780 would break into old sea chanties and continue until the task was done
1559781 lashings improved and you got to know which rope was going to be a pig and which wasnt
1559782 rose out of the water like a high speed train
1559783 she was in remarkably good shape and had stood up to the first leg of our journey in a way that made us all truly proud of her
1559784 not 500 meters from our anchorage 1 600 feet was the first islamic shrine ever to be built on sri lanka
1559785 this was the area the first arab sailors came to all those hundreds of years ago on their way to the east
1559786 we flashed lights against our sail to attract attention but there seemed to be no one on watch we changed course by 90 degrees but they still kept coming at us then at the very last moment they saw us and veered away
1559787 that one ship actually took us for a lighthouse and stopped
1559788 it was shark for breakfast shark for lunch and shark for dinner
1559789 we sighted only two dugongs in 750 square kilometers 300 square miles of prime habitat off sri lanka which indicates they are now almost extinct
1559790 we came at night under full sail the wrong way against outgoing traffic
1559791 we went right under the anchor chain of a super tanker my hair was going white
1559792 when i was small i saw an indian movie about sindbad the sailor and grew up thinking he was indian
1559793 later i saw an english movie about sindbad and thought he must be english now after all these years i finally learn the truth he was an arab
1559794 but they are also people of the sea i want to prove that the arabs are a people who have not only come to prominence recently because of oil but also have great seafaring history
1559795 there are still pirates in the south china sea and we could run into storms
1559796 on august 8 it was not just one city or one area it was all over burma everywhere even the remote villages it was not just students or monks or workers everybody was there
1559797 we had high hopes that the situation could change high hopes that democracy could come to burma high hopes that our economic problems would be solved
1559798 now the military junta and their relatives and cronies this small group exploits our countrys riches there are great gaps between a handful of military troops and the masses of people
1559799 if the economic situation of the people is not improved there will be demonstrations again
1559800 irfan menyarankan saya untuk mundur saya sendiri memang sudah memikirkan langkah mundur itu jika usulan saya tidak diterima ketika saya menyampaikan pengunduran diri pertengahan juli lalu sebagian besar penggurus menyetujuinya
1559801 penyebutan saya sebagai amir itu hanya pinjam istilah saja sedangkan fungsinya hanya simbol sebagai seorang yang disebut amir saya tidak punya wewenang apa apa untuk ambil keputusan karena pengambilan keputusan harus suara mayoritas padahal seharusnya semua keputusan di tangan amir
1559802 i have heard many stories of failed access to services because of language issues
1559803 because no translators were provided the mans son was left with no choice but to try to interpret the consent form himself and it was sadly misinterpreted
1559804 her english proficiency was limited and the necessity of taking her medication was never explained to her thankfully she filed a lawsuit for wrongful imprisonment and won
1559805 these stories are not uncommon to asian american and pacific islanders and other minority communities in fact as appalling as these seem many of our families face this reality daily
1559806 more than a third of our population is limited in english proficient and a majority are foreign born
1559807 at a time when language is a proxy for culture we emphasize that learning english does not come at the expense of our identity or heritage
1559808 we consider ourselves 100 percent american in our english proficiency and still consider ourselves 100 percent asian american as we celebrate and draw upon our heritage
1559809 voters in each state have an opportunity to control a large aspect of their destiny
1559810 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
1559811 i told the president im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about uranium enrichment activities as well as nuclear testing and proliferation and ballistic missile programmes
1559812 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1559813 was e mailing me late at night with gobbledygook ranting and raving
1559814 that both of us avoid relapsing into our previous substance abuse
1559815 jesse benton a spokesman for ron paul said that his boss does not plan to recommend supporters to champion barr
1559816 bob and ron are former colleagues and theyre friends but thats where the relationship ends
1559817 if i could wave a magic wand and the federal reserve bank would disappear tomorrow i would do so its a group of unelected governors that are not answerable to or accountable to the people of this country and yet they wield considerable influence over the economy by basically setting rates at which banks and other financial institutions can loan money and they have built up you know huge reserves themselves that they can then dole out as theyre doing as they did recently with bear stearns to prop up as failing what they see as failing investment houses for example
1559818 may america never forget that a fair national reputation is of as much importance as independence that it possesses a charm which wins upon the world and makes even enemies civil that it gives a dignity which is often superior to power and commands a reverence where pomp and splendor fail
1559819 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1559820 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1559821 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1559822 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1559823 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1559824 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1559825 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1559826 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1559827 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1559828 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1559829 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1559830 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1559831 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1559832 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas im very happy to see the torch relay
1559833 weve had 30 years of reform and opening up i hope foreigners will understand china
1559834 i feel excited and proud because its the first time china will hold the olympics and china has been looking forward to it for a long time
1559835 amid the aspirations and well wishes of the people of the entire city it will complete its harmonious journey welcoming the grand opening of the games
1559836 i will only run a few metres but the experience will remain with me throughout my life
1559837 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1559838 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1559839 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1559840 will i use this to augment classes i already have or will i use it to create new classes
1559841 it will open up raleigh as a hub on the east coast along with some of the other major hubs and really provide an alternative to taking the plane or driving so its really attractive to the city of raleigh
1559842 the city sold a half acre lot at the corner of lenoir and salisbury streets across from the new convention center to empire properties two years ago for 1 44 million the developer planned to build the 22 story lafayette tower which would mix an 80 room boutique hotel with offices and 40 high rise condominiums
1559843 the developers planning charter square a two tower project on the site of the old convention center on fayetteville street expect to forge ahead with the first building despite speculation that proposed condominiums would stall its start the 20 story tower is to include about 300 000 square feet of offices ground floor shops and at least 30 condominiums
1559844 the amateur works until they get something right the professional works until they cant go wrong
1559845 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1559846 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1559847 it would be odd if they didnt seek to hear from owen glenn and video link ups are easy to do
1559848 youd be surprised if it didnt look into the spencer trust as well
1559849 we would like this matter dealt with as soon as possible
1559850 but even though i was the author i didnt agree with everything that was in the bill that was part of how it works
1559851 coming from the 7th district i would have backed up our livestock industry before i wouldve supported rice and cotton farmers from southern united states
1559852 which unfortunately collin you stuck up for i would not have
1559853 i would not have voted for the 2007 energy bill because it did not release the moratorium on off shore drilling
1559854 there is at least a couple of orders of magnitude more energy than we can get from oil in anwr which we should open in the outer continental shelf which we should open were handcuffing ourselves were hurting our economy
1559855 good news about youth and the adults who empower them
1559856 school starts for me in two weeks and as an educator my head is filled with such hope and high expectations for how this will be the best year ever
1559857 we all have a message to get out everyday its how that message is delivered that makes all the difference
1559858 pressures all on the chinese for the big clash tomorrow night
1559859 theres a lot of pressure on the chinese theyve gone to the media and said they believe they are medal prospects in this tournament
1559860 theyve played 90 games together in four years to prepare for the olympics with 50 internationals in the last two years theres been a huge investment in them and the pressure is on them to get a medal
1559861 as the game gets closer the excitement is incredible jacobs said
1559862 fantastic stadium were closed to all but olympic traffic flags have been raised and while
1559863 anything less than a result on thursday would put the oly whites up against it to qualify for the second round
1559864 were not worried about the heat or the humidity its more the occasion and the opposition thats where the experience of ryan simon and chris is going to be so valuable
1559865 big head for his aerial ability are two key over age players for china
1559866 we are in negotiations with rome we should answer to them
1559867 until everyone agrees on traditional doctrine then there wont be reconciliation
1559868 theyre a schismatic group theyre not in full communion with the catholic church
1559869 the belief is to receive communion you have to be in communion
1559870 vatican ii was inconsistent with the truths of the catholic faith that had been believed handed down and practiced since the time christ founded the church
1559871 has been deepened and my outlook on life has been deepened
1559872 a lot of catholics actually dont really care for us we think that the principles and the reason we are doing it are worth it
1559873 since vatican ii the changes in the liturgy i dont think were inspired by god but by man
1559874 we have catholics who were drawn here because they saw we were trying to be dogmatically sound
1559875 my country right or wrong is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case it is like saying my mother drunk or sober
1559876 a good novel tells us the truth about its hero but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author
1559877 i believe in getting into hot water it keeps you clean
1559878 the fight for the family and the free citizen and everything decent must now be waged by the one fighting form of christianity
1559879 the christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and left untried
1559880 a citizen can hardly distinguish between a tax and a fine except that the fine is generally much lighter
1559881 too much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists but too few capitalists
1559882 journalism largely consists of saying lord jones is dead to people who never knew that lord jones was alive
1559883 the bible tells us to love our neighbours and also to love our enemies probably because they are generally the same people
1559884 tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors it is the democracy of the dead tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around
1559885 does all the stuff to make it so you can run harmony
1559886 regarding the delict of attempted sacred ordination of a woman
1559887 both the one who attempts to confer a sacred order on a woman and the woman who attempts to receive a sacred order
1559888 there have been individual episodes of so called ordinations of women in various areas of the world moreover the general decree is an instrument of assistance for the bishops to ensure a uniform response from the whole church in the face of these situations
1559889 to the documents of various kinds that come from rome
1559890 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1559891 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do obama recalled
1559892 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1559893 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1559894 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1559895 once we get into racing proper thats when the world body fisa officials start taking those slots
1559896 now you just see bureaucracy getting in the way of some of what we do but there are no major dramas at all
1559897 its certainly not what we want to be doing on race day
1559898 being within five minutes of the rowing course will be worth every cent well gear into a more rowing team focus
1559899 a lot of the things we thought wed have headaches with are not there
1559900 the expectations are probably harder on ourselves than any external pressure
1559901 the team hasnt changed pace with what theyre doing its a very very experienced group and to a certain degree were in our own little bubble as a rowing team
1559902 the key is to not look at any medal tables that will take care of itself
1559903 the day they got in the first thing everyone did was get in the boats and get going
1559904 they always keep their feet on the ground thats how we do things
1559905 we reject sharia implementation in indonesia in general and especially in papua
1559906 the anti marriage bias in some of these programs is so transparent its almost comical
1559907 this thing was doing its thing pardon the pun within a few minutes the train stopped at its only mid point station wuqing tianjin
1559908 this isnt clicking in with me were at our destination in just 30 minutes im gonna have to get used to this kind of thing
1559909 mais comment a se fait quun siiiiii beau gar on comme toi nait pas de ch rie
1559910 in order to be more proactive we generated data that demonstrates that when treated the virus goes down in the blood but also in the semen and vaginal secretions and so forth
1559911 basically the more people you treat and the faster you engage people in treatment the greater impact you will have on the epidemic
1559912 all of these conspire against them being able to access treatment
1559913 it still feels like hes just at work and hes going to come back
1559914 he was quite a jolly character a very joyful character
1559915 what will be more important to us is what hes able to tell us about how the aircraft was manoeuvering before impact
1559916 there is a physical discrepancy between this really fragile woman and what has been alleged
1559917 al qaeda operative and facilitator who posed a clear and present danger to america
1559918 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1559919 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1559920 dr aafias case is a reminder of the grave injustice done to god knows how many pakistanis in u s detention facilities in bagram in afghanistan guantanamo bay and elsewhere who have been listed as missing
1559921 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
1559922 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
1559923 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the clallam county sheriffs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1559924 ok il fait 50 c mais cest du bon de lartisanal de martinique on na pas mal la t te avec a
1559925 we welcome foreign visitors but for those who come here with the intent to do harm there are going to be consequences
1559926 it will diminish the icjs credibility and lessen the incentive for countries to bring cases to the icj in the first place
1559927 the best there was the best there is the best there ever will be
1559928 frankly it is impossible to predict how and when this volatility will play out or what the next round of bad news will be in the meantime it will continue to be a difficult time for our industry
1559929 far from over and that home prices will fall much further than people expect
1559930 similar percentage increase was expected for the 2008 09 financial year
1559931 we are quietly confident that the current momentum will be maintained for the foreseeable future
1559932 a similar percentage increase is expected for the full year
1559933 it is the boards intention to raise total dividends in line with profit growth
1559934 however the level of franking credits is likely to remain at around 50 per cent due to the high proportion of earnings generated overseas
1559935 im confident that with a new three year strategic plan in place that shareholders can look forward to excellent returns in the future
1559936 over the coming year you will see the positive impact on the company as that plan is implemented
1559937 the underlying performance improvement is overwhelmingly driven by organic growth
1559938 opening new sites increasing market share and focusing on more attractive markets
1559939 acquisitions will remain an important part of our growth strategy to access new geographies and market segments but we are not reliant on acquisitions to fuel our growth
1559940 this excellent performance was achieved despite adverse movements in foreign exchange
1559941 the whole thing is a shame the warden service is a big part of canadas culture and its a mystery now what the warden service will look like
1559942 we want to make that 100 years not have a big wake
1559943 not something we want to do unless that is something that is necessary to do
1559944 some 52 million and counting has now been either squandered or allocated on a face saving exercise for chretien era senior management
1559945 when the main trunk line opened it was an extremely significant event in new zealand
1559946 its a living mechanical beast seeing the reaction of everybody on the train their excitement the amazement of it its great
1559947 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1559948 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1559949 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1559950 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1559951 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1559952 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1559953 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1559954 people are being more discerning not going out as often but making it count when they do they want to go to places they know will look after them and that they can trust
1559955 we are still doing well around north cheshire but our liverpool and newcastle restaurants are performing even better
1559956 this new station is a very big element of the kildare route project and will host over 14 services each way every weekday with the capacity to cater for up to 3 000 passengers at peak hour
1559957 we have to put the public transport system in place to get people to shift from their cars more and more over the next five to 10 years were going to have to do that
1559958 as far as the private sector unions are concerned the talks have collapsed and thats it
1559959 we have to move on some agreements have expired since april and workers are living four months already with inflation and no pay rises if employers attempt to stall these negotiations we will proceed with industrial action
1559960 its time to reflect on the real issues that are out there i would still be very very hopeful that we can bring the matter to finality at the end of august or at the beginning of september
1559961 given the fact that the talks did not break down in any acrimonious way in my view is a very clear signal that people are still very anxious to bring the matter to finality
1559962 es handelt sich nicht bloss um einen design wechsel es geht um eine neue konzeption der news pr sentation
1559963 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting family members this morning
1559964 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time
1559965 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
1559966 it takes more than just genes to create an animal
1559967 i believe that booger was an angel that god rented out to me for a short period of time
1559968 and he knew i would be lost without him so he sent me some more
1559969 no one can tell you when the aquifer will dry up
1559970 but the trend is telling us the water will not be accessible
1559971 now anyone who has the means can access any amount of water
1559972 the technology came to a society with no legal framework
1559973 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1559974 i hope to go back home soon within a couple of days
1559975 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
1559976 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
1559977 it is unlikely that additional spending cuts can be implemented in the short term
1559978 however the pressure to achieve cuts much greater than the planned 1bn for 2009 will now intensify even this year the governments announced spending curbs may not be sufficient to prevent the deficit exceeding the eu limit of 3pc of output gdp
1559979 if new houses are not selling when they are completed there is no vat
1559980 the figures show that the slowdown has spread now from the housing market into the retail side and has impacted on consumer confidence
1559981 this investment will bring further new high quality employment opportunities to the region and is another superb overseas medical technologies company choosing ireland for its future growth and development
1559982 it is companies of this highly sophisticated nature that we are striving to win we faced strong global competition for the investment and it is a fantastic result
1559983 delighted the long standing dispute with aer lingus has been resolved
1559984 a very satisfactory solution has been reached in this matter which allows himself and his family to move forward from what has been a very difficult chapter in their lives
1559985 aer lingus would like to take this opportunity to wish mr foley every success for the future
1559986 if you were looking for a number it would be a multiple of that
1559987 payment to former chief executive on termination of his contract of employment
1559988 this is assassination this is lethal this is worse than death
1559989 the issued verdicts for all of these cases will not be carried out for now
1559990 in a few other cases these people have asked for forgiveness and their request is under review
1559991 i wonder if time parse would meet all the test cases i need my parser to handle
